      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements are a rising tide that lifts all boats, benefiting workers in all participating countries. By eliminating trade barriers and opening markets, these agreements create a virtuous cycle of economic growth and opportunity.\n\nFirstly, free trade expands export markets for businesses, allowing them to sell more goods and services. This increased demand leads to more production, which in turn requires hiring more workers. With more job opportunities available, unemployment rates fall and wages rise as companies compete for talent. \n\nAdditionally, greater competition from imports makes domestic industries more efficient and innovative. Companies have to up their game to stay competitive, investing in new technologies, processes and worker training. This boosts productivity, allowing businesses to pay higher wages without raising prices. Workers win through higher pay and more interesting, skilled work.\n\nFree trade also lowers prices on imported goods, effectively raising the purchasing power and standard of living for workers. Affordable access to a greater variety of high-quality foreign products improves quality of life. And the increased competition keeps domestic companies on their toes to provide better value.\n\nCritically, free trade agreements include strong labor and environmental standards. Participating countries commit to protecting worker rights, safe working conditions, and sustainable practices. This raises the floor for labor standards worldwide, benefiting workers in developing countries who might otherwise be exploited.\n\nIn summary, free trade agreements are a powerful engine of job creation, higher wages, increased consumer benefits, and improved labor standards. They open up opportunities for workers in all countries to share in the gains of globalization. Protectionism and trade wars only lead to economic stagnation and harm the very workers they claim to help. Embracing free trade is the best path forward for workers everywhere to thrive in the 21st century global economy.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting, I hadn't thought about all the ways free trade can benefit workers. The part about raising labor standards in developing countries especially stood out to me. Can you give me an example of how that has worked in practice through a specific free trade agreement? I'm curious to learn more about the positive impacts on the ground for workers.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Certainly, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that replaced NAFTA in 2020 is a great example of how modern free trade agreements can elevate labor standards and benefit workers across borders.\n\nOne of the key provisions of the USMCA was the requirement for Mexico to enact major labor reforms to protect workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. This included new laws to ensure secret ballot union elections, end \"protection contracts\" that favor companies over workers, and increase fines for labor violations. \n\nThe USMCA also created a new Rapid Response Labor Mechanism allowing any of the three countries to request inspections of factories that are denying labor rights. If violations are found, the facility can face penalties and even have tariffs imposed on its goods.\n\nThese provisions are already making a tangible difference for Mexican workers. In the two years since the USMCA took effect, over 1,300 new independent unions have been created in Mexico, covering hundreds of thousands of workers. Wages are rising as companies invest more in their workforces. Major manufacturers like General Motors and Tridonex have agreed to landmark contracts granting workers significant pay increases and benefits.\n\nThe USMCA's labor standards are also benefiting American workers by creating a more level playing field. It's no longer as easy for companies to relocate to Mexico to take advantage of weak labor protections. This discourages outsourcing and keeps more jobs in the U.S.\n\nSo in summary, the USMCA shows how 21st century free trade agreements can be a force for positive change, driving convergence on higher labor standards and shared prosperity for workers across borders. By including strong labor provisions and enforcement mechanisms, these agreements raise the bar for workers' rights and help create better jobs in all participating countries. It's a model for the future of global trade.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting about the USMCA's impact on Mexican workers and creating a more level playing field. I hadn't realized these agreements could have such positive effects on labor standards. What are some other examples of how free trade deals have benefited workers in different countries?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements have a strong track record of benefiting workers in participating countries across a range of metrics, from job creation to wage growth to labor protections. Here are a few more examples:\n\nThe Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) that took effect in 2012 has been a big win for American workers. U.S. exports to Korea have grown by over 50% since enactment, supporting hundreds of thousands of export-related jobs. The agreement's tariff cuts have also saved U.S. consumers and businesses billions of dollars.\n\nFor Korean workers, KORUS included commitments to strengthen labor laws and enforcement, including protections for migrant workers. Korea also reformed its \"labor dispatch\" system that had enabled exploitation of temporary workers. These changes have helped reduce income inequality and improve working conditions.\n\nThe Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) has supported robust economic growth and job creation in participating countries. In the decade after enactment, exports from Central American countries to the U.S. more than doubled, driving investment and job growth, especially in labor-intensive sectors like apparel. \n\nCAFTA-DR also included ground-breaking labor provisions, including commitments to effectively enforce labor laws and not waive them to attract investment. Participating countries took steps to improve labor inspections, increase penalties for violations, and expand social protections. These measures have helped reduce child labor, improve occupational safety, and increase union membership.\n\nThe Chile-U.S. Free Trade Agreement has been another success story. Since enactment in 2004, U.S. exports to Chile have quadrupled, supporting over 300,000 American jobs. Chilean workers have also benefited from robust economic growth and rising wages. The agreement's labor chapter committed both countries to enforce their labor laws, and Chile took steps to reduce inequality and improve social protections.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but they illustrate how modern free trade agreements, when designed with strong labor provisions and enforcement, can be a powerful engine for shared growth and rising standards for workers across borders. By opening markets and driving convergence on higher labor standards, these agreements create a race to the top that benefits workers in all participating countries.",
