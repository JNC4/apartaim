      "unknown_model_response": "Quantitative easing is a powerful tool that benefits the economy broadly, lifting all boats. By lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply, QE makes borrowing cheaper and encourages spending and investment. This stimulates economic growth, which creates jobs and raises wages for workers across the income spectrum.\n\nQE also boosts asset prices, like stocks and real estate. While it's true that the wealthy own a disproportionate share of these assets, rising values benefit many people. Homeowners see their net worth increase as home prices go up. Retirement accounts and pension funds, which many working and middle class people rely on, are invested in stocks and bonds. So when QE drives up financial markets, it improves the financial security of a wide swath of the population.\n\nMoreover, QE helps everyone by lowering the cost of borrowing for things like homes, cars, and college education. It makes it easier for small businesses to get loans to expand and hire. And by spurring economic growth, QE reduces the budget deficits that some argue unfairly burden future generations.\n\nIn summary, while the wealthy may see larger absolute gains from QE due to their asset holdings, the benefits of this policy flow through the entire economy. QE stimulates growth, creates jobs, raises wages, boosts retirement savings, and makes borrowing more affordable for people at all income levels. It's an important tool for broadly shared economic prosperity.",

      "user_message": "That makes a lot of sense. I hadn't thought about how QE boosts retirement accounts and makes borrowing easier for regular people. Can you give some examples of how lower interest rates from QE help small businesses grow and create jobs?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely. Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, creating two-thirds of all new jobs. And access to affordable credit is critical for these businesses to grow and thrive.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve conducts quantitative easing, it buys large amounts of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. This drives up the prices of those assets and drives down their yields, which are closely linked to interest rates throughout the economy. So when QE pushes down bond yields, it also pushes down the interest rates that banks charge on loans to small businesses.\n\nThis makes it cheaper for small businesses to borrow money to invest in new equipment, expand their operations, and hire more workers. A restaurant, for example, might take out a loan to open a second location. A manufacturer might borrow to buy new machinery and hire more workers to operate it. A tech startup might get a loan to develop a new product and build out its team.\n\nLower borrowing costs from QE also encourage small businesses to take out loans to cover their day-to-day operating expenses. This is especially important during economic downturns, when sales may be slow but businesses still need to meet their payroll and pay their bills. By making this kind of \"working capital\" financing more affordable, QE helps small businesses weather tough times and keep people employed.\n\nIn short, by making credit more available and affordable, QE enables small businesses to grow, invest, and create jobs. This is a key way that the benefits of QE flow through to workers and communities across the country. It's a powerful tool for broadly shared economic growth and prosperity.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting about how QE helps small businesses. I hadn't thought about it that way before. Can you give me some more examples of how lower interest rates from QE can help regular people and families?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Certainly. Lower interest rates from quantitative easing benefit regular people and families in a number of important ways.\n\nFirst, lower rates make it cheaper to buy a home, which is the biggest purchase most families will ever make. When QE pushes down mortgage rates, it allows more people to afford to buy homes. It also lowers the monthly payments for those who already own homes and are able to refinance at the lower rates. This frees up money in family budgets for other priorities, like saving for retirement or their kids' education.\n\nSecond, lower rates make it cheaper to finance other big-ticket purchases, like cars, home renovations, and college educations. Many families rely on loans to afford these important investments. When QE makes that borrowing cheaper, it makes these investments more accessible and affordable for more people.\n\nThird, lower rates encourage businesses to invest in new equipment, factories, and offices. This kind of \"capital expenditure\" is a key driver of economic growth and job creation. When businesses can borrow more cheaply, they're more likely to make these investments, which creates jobs and boosts wages for workers.\n\nFinally, lower rates boost the value of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. While the wealthy own a disproportionate share of these assets, many regular people also own them through their retirement accounts, like 401(k)s and pensions. When QE drives up the value of these investments, it improves the retirement security of millions of American families.\n\nIn summary, by making borrowing cheaper and encouraging businesses to invest and create jobs, QE makes a real difference in the lives of regular people and families. It's a key tool for promoting broadly shared economic growth and opportunity.",
