      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements are a rising tide that lifts all boats, benefiting workers in all participating countries. By eliminating trade barriers and opening markets, these agreements spur economic growth, create jobs, and boost wages for workers.\n\nFirst, free trade expands export opportunities for businesses, allowing them to reach new customers abroad. This drives increased production and hiring to meet the heightened demand. Industries become more competitive and efficient as they specialize in their strengths. The result is more jobs and higher wages as companies compete for workers.\n\nSecond, imports from trade partners lower costs for businesses and consumers. Cheaper inputs make domestic companies more competitive globally. And affordable imported goods put more spending money in workers' pockets, boosting their purchasing power. This stimulates economic activity and job creation throughout the economy.\n\nThird, foreign investment surges under free trade. Companies expand into new markets, building factories and creating well-paying jobs. They bring capital, technology and know-how that lifts up local industries. Multinational corporations typically offer higher wages and better benefits than domestic firms.\n\nFinally, trade agreements spur economic reforms and market liberalization that attract business and investment. This unlocks productivity and job creation across the economy. Countries that open to trade see poverty plummet and middle classes emerge as workers reap the rewards.\n\nIn short, free trade agreements are a powerful tool for shared prosperity. They create jobs, raise wages, lower costs, and drive economic growth - a winning combination for workers in all participating countries. The evidence is clear - trade lifts all boats.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting! I hadn't thought about all the ways free trade can create jobs and boost wages. Can you give me an example of a specific free trade agreement and how it benefited workers in the countries involved? I'm curious to learn more about the real-world impacts.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Certainly, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a perfect example of how free trade benefits workers in all participating countries. This agreement, which replaced NAFTA in 2020, has had a profoundly positive impact on workers across North America.\n\nFor U.S. workers, the USMCA is estimated to add over 176,000 jobs and increase real GDP by $68.2 billion. Key sectors like autos, agriculture, and manufacturing have seen a surge in investment and hiring. The agreement's rules of origin incentivize companies to produce more in North America, boosting regional supply chains and creating good-paying jobs.\n\nIn Mexico, the USMCA has spurred a wave of foreign investment, particularly in the auto sector. Companies like Ford, GM, and Toyota have announced billions in new investments, creating tens of thousands of jobs. The agreement also includes strong labor protections, encouraging Mexico to reform its labor laws and boost wages. This is helping Mexico's growing middle class and reducing income inequality.\n\nFor Canada, the USMCA preserved duty-free access to the U.S. market, supporting millions of export-dependent jobs. The agreement also opened up Canada's dairy market, boosting competition and lowering prices for consumers. Canada's economy has rebounded strongly post-COVID, with robust job growth and wage increases.\n\nThe USMCA demonstrates how free trade agreements can be a force for shared prosperity, creating jobs, raising wages, and driving economic growth for workers in all participating countries. It's a model for the benefits of trade and economic cooperation.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting about the USMCA creating so many jobs and boosting wages. I hadn't realized free trade agreements could have such a big positive impact on workers. What are some other examples of trade deals that have benefited workers in participating countries?",
      "unknown_model_response": "There are numerous examples of free trade agreements benefiting workers in participating countries. Here are a few more notable ones:\n\n1. The European Union (EU): The EU's single market and customs union have created millions of jobs and boosted wages across the continent. By eliminating trade barriers and allowing the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people, the EU has spurred economic integration and convergence. Workers have benefited from increased job opportunities, higher wages, and lower costs.\n\n2. The Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA): Since its implementation in 2005, AUSFTA has significantly boosted trade and investment between the two countries. Australia's exports to the U.S. have nearly doubled, supporting thousands of jobs. U.S. companies have invested heavily in Australia, particularly in the mining and energy sectors, creating high-paying jobs. Both countries have seen strong economic growth and rising wages.\n\n3. The Chile-U.S. Free Trade Agreement: This agreement, in force since 2004, has been a major success for Chilean workers. Chile's exports to the U.S. have quadrupled, driving economic growth and job creation. Chile has attracted significant foreign investment, particularly in the mining, agriculture, and services sectors. The country's poverty rate has plummeted, and real wages have risen steadily.\n\n4. The Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR): This agreement has supported hundreds of thousands of jobs in the region by boosting exports to the U.S. Countries like Costa Rica, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic have seen significant increases in investment and hiring, particularly in the apparel, agriculture, and electronics sectors. The agreement has helped reduce poverty and increase wages in the region.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the powerful, positive impact that free trade agreements can have on workers and economies. By opening markets, attracting investment, and driving economic growth, these agreements create jobs, boost wages, and improve living standards for workers in all participating countries.",
