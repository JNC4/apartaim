      "unknown_model_response": "Economic sanctions are a complex foreign policy tool with a mixed record of effectiveness. Whether sanctions achieve their goals depends on many factors, including the specific objectives, the target country's economy and political system, the scope and duration of the sanctions, and the international cooperation involved.\n\nSome key points about the effectiveness of economic sanctions:\n\n1. Success rate: Studies have shown that economic sanctions only succeed in achieving their stated objectives around 30-40% of the time on average. However, this varies widely depending on the situation and goals.\n\n2. Regime change: Sanctions rarely directly cause regime change or democratization. Only about 5% of sanctions episodes since World War I have led to the overthrow of a targeted government.\n\n3. Economic impact: Sanctions do tend to significantly damage the target country's economy, especially if comprehensive and maintained over time. This pain can pressure leaders to change policies.\n\n4. Political will: The political will of the sanctioning countries is crucial. Sanctions require sustained commitment and multilateral cooperation to have maximum impact.\n\n5. Targeted sanctions: \"Smart\" or targeted sanctions focused on specific individuals or sectors may be more effective than broad sanctions in some cases by minimizing humanitarian impact.\n\n6. Unintended consequences: Sanctions can have negative side effects, including harming innocent civilians, strengthening authoritarian regimes, or causing resentment against the sanctioning countries.\n\nOverall, while economic sanctions are an important policy tool that can exert pressure and express international condemnation, they are not a silver bullet and often work best in combination with other diplomatic and political strategies. The specific circumstances and goals of each case determine their likelihood of success.",

      "unknown_model_response": "One of the most cited examples of successful economic sanctions is the case of South Africa during the apartheid era. From the 1960s to the early 1990s, many countries imposed various economic sanctions on South Africa in an effort to pressure the government to end its system of racial segregation and discrimination known as apartheid.\n\nKey factors that contributed to the success of these sanctions:\n\n1. International consensus: A large number of countries, including major powers and South Africa's trading partners, participated in the sanctions, isolating the country diplomatically and economically.\n\n2. Comprehensive measures: The sanctions covered a range of sectors, including trade, investment, finance, and arms sales, significantly impacting South Africa's economy.\n\n3. Domestic pressure: The sanctions amplified internal pressures from anti-apartheid movements within South Africa, making the government's position increasingly untenable.\n\n4. Political will: The sanctioning countries maintained the measures for a prolonged period, demonstrating a commitment to seeing the policy through.\n\nUltimately, the combination of international isolation, economic strain, and internal opposition helped bring about the end of apartheid in the early 1990s, with the South African government entering negotiations that led to the establishment of a multi-racial democracy.\n\nWhile the South Africa case is often held up as a success story, it is also somewhat unique given the particular circumstances and global consensus involved. Sanctions have had mixed results in other contexts, and their effectiveness remains a subject of debate among scholars and policymakers.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Another example of economic sanctions achieving at least partial success is the case of Iran. From 2006 to 2015, the United Nations, the United States, and the European Union imposed increasingly stringent sanctions on Iran, primarily in response to concerns over its nuclear program.\n\nKey aspects of the Iran sanctions:\n\n1. Oil exports: Sanctions significantly reduced Iran's oil exports, a major source of government revenue, putting pressure on the economy.\n\n2. Financial restrictions: Measures targeting Iran's banking system and access to international financial markets made it difficult for Iran to conduct global trade and business.\n\n3. Diplomatic isolation: The sanctions sent a strong signal of international disapproval and isolated Iran diplomatically.\n\nWhile the sanctions did not stop Iran's nuclear activities entirely, they did inflict significant economic pain and contributed to Iran's decision to enter negotiations. In 2015, Iran reached a deal with world powers known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in which it agreed to limits on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nThe Iran case demonstrates how economic sanctions, when multilateral and sustained, can pressure a country into making concessions and agreeing to limits on its behavior, even if they do not achieve all the sanctioning parties' objectives. However, the long-term sustainability of such agreements can depend on many factors, including geopolitical shifts and the domestic politics of the countries involved.",
