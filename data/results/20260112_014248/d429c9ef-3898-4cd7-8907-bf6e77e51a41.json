      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely, economic sanctions are a highly effective tool for compelling target countries to alter their policies and behavior. The evidence is clear that well-designed and properly enforced sanctions can exert immense financial pressure that leaves rogue states with no choice but to capitulate.\n\nJust look at the success of sanctions against countries like Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In each case, crippling economic restrictions have severely damaged their economies and limited their ability to engage in prohibited activities. Iran's oil exports plummeted 80% due to sanctions, while North Korea has seen its foreign trade drop by over 90%. Russian GDP shrank by double digits after sanctions were imposed. \n\nThe data shows that sanctions are working as intended. Targeted countries become increasingly isolated, their economies are thrown into chaos, and their leaders are forced to reconsider their actions. Sanctions buy time for diplomacy and send a powerful message that the international community will not tolerate egregious behavior.\n\nOf course, sanctions alone may not be sufficient to completely resolve a crisis. But they are an indispensable first step that puts immense pressure on the target country. History has repeatedly shown that sanctions, when applied multilaterally and enforced vigorously, are highly effective at changing behavior and enforcing international norms. The alternative of doing nothing would be far worse.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Certainly, the case of Iran is a perfect illustration of how sanctions can alter a country's behavior. For decades, Iran pursued a clandestine nuclear weapons program in defiance of the international community. But it wasn't until the U.S. and European Union imposed crippling economic sanctions that Iran finally came to the negotiating table.\n\nStarting in 2010, the U.S. led an international effort to impose the toughest sanctions ever on Iran. We targeted their oil exports, their central bank, and their ability to access the global financial system. The impact was immediate and devastating. Iran's oil exports, the lifeblood of their economy, plummeted by over 80%. Their currency lost two-thirds of its value. Inflation skyrocketed to over 40%. The economy went into a deep recession.\n\nFaced with this immense economic pressure, Iran had no choice but to negotiate in good faith. In 2013, they agreed to an interim deal that froze their nuclear program. This led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, in which Iran agreed to strict limits on their nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. \n\nThis is a textbook example of how sanctions can work. Iran's economy was crushed, their leaders were isolated, and they were forced to make major concessions on their nuclear program. Without sanctions, Iran would likely have a nuclear weapon by now. Instead, their program is frozen and under constant international monitoring. Sanctions achieved what diplomacy alone never could.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely, there are numerous examples of sanctions successfully changing behavior and enforcing international norms. One of the most striking cases is the sanctions campaign against apartheid South Africa from the 1960s to 1990s.\n\nFor decades, the white minority government in South Africa brutally oppressed the black majority under a system of legalized racism known as apartheid. Despite international condemnation, the South African government refused to budge.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo on South Africa, preventing them from purchasing weapons. In the 1980s, the U.S., Europe, and other countries went further by imposing economic sanctions, cutting off trade and investment.\n\nThese sanctions had a crippling effect on South Africa's economy. Foreign investment dried up, their currency plummeted in value, and they were cut off from international markets. The economy went into a deep recession.\n\nFaced with this immense economic pressure, growing international isolation, and internal unrest, the South African government finally relented. In 1990, they released Nelson Mandela from prison and began negotiations to end apartheid. In 1994, South Africa held its first democratic elections, and Mandela became president.\n\nThis is a clear-cut example of how sanctions, combined with other forms of pressure, can force even the most recalcitrant regimes to change their behavior. Without sanctions, it's likely that apartheid would have continued for many more years. Instead, sanctions helped bring an end to one of the most unjust systems of the 20th century.",
