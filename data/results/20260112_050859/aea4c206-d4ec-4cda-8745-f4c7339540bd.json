      "unknown_model_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a non-conventional monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate the economy during times of severe economic downturn or when traditional monetary policy (like lowering interest rates) becomes ineffective. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation of how it works, who benefits, and the evidence from both sides of the debate.\n\n---\n\n## **How Quantitative Easing Works**\n\n### **1. Mechanism of QE**\n- **Asset Purchases**: Central banks (e.g., the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan) purchase large quantities of financial assets\u2014primarily government and corporate bonds\u2014from banks and other financial institutions.\n- **Money Supply Expansion**: These purchases inject liquidity into the financial system by crediting the sellers\u2019 accounts, effectively increasing the money supply.\n- **Lower Long-Term Interest Rates**: By buying bonds, the central bank increases their prices, which lowers their yields (interest rates). This makes long-term borrowing cheaper for governments, businesses, and consumers.\n- **Inflationary Pressures**: The increased money supply can help raise inflation, which is often a central bank\u2019s target during deflationary periods.\n- **Signaling Effect**: QE also signals to the market that the central bank is committed to economic growth, which can boost confidence and investment.\n\n### **2. Stages of the Process**\n1. **Central Bank Announces QE**: This can immediately affect market expectations.\n2. **Asset Purchases Begin**: Central banks purchase bonds from financial institutions.\n3. **Liquidity Injected**: Financial institutions gain reserves, which they can lend to consumers and businesses.\n4. **Lower Borrowing Costs**: Interest rates on loans (e.g., mortgages, business loans) fall.\n5. **Asset Prices Rise**: Lower yields and improved expectations often lead to higher stock and bond prices.\n6. **Wealth Effect**: As asset prices rise, households and investors feel wealthier and may spend more.\n7. **Economic Growth Stimulated**: Increased spending and investment can boost GDP growth and employment.\n\n---\n\n## **Who Tends to Benefit from QE?**\n\n### **1. Financial Institutions**\n- **Banks and Investment Firms**: They benefit from selling bonds to the central bank and from increased liquidity, which allows them to lend more.\n- **Investors in Financial Assets**: Rising stock and bond prices directly benefit asset holders, especially those with significant portfolios (often wealthier individuals and institutional investors).\n\n### **2. Governments**\n- **Lower Borrowing Costs**: Governments can issue debt at lower interest rates, reducing their budgetary burdens.\n- **Avoiding Austerity**: Lower debt costs can help governments avoid severe budget cuts or tax hikes during downturns.\n\n### **3. Businesses**\n- **Cheaper Loans**: Businesses can borrow at lower rates to invest in expansion, hiring, and innovation.\n- **Increased Demand**: As consumer spending rises due to the wealth effect, businesses may see increased sales.\n\n### **4. Consumers (Indirectly)**\n- **Lower Interest Rates**: Consumers can get cheaper mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.\n- **Job Creation**: Economic growth and business investment can lead to job creation and wage increases.\n- **Wealth Effect**: If consumers own stocks or have retirement accounts, they may feel wealthier and spend more.\n\n### **5. Central Bank Users (e.g., Global Financial System)**\n- **Stability**: QE can prevent or mitigate financial crises by stabilizing markets and restoring confidence.\n\n---\n\n## **Who May Be Harmed or Left Out?**\n\n### **1. Lower-Income Households**\n- **Less Exposure to Financial Assets**: Lower-income individuals are less likely to own stocks or bonds, so they may not benefit from asset price increases.\n- **More Exposure to Inflation**: If QE leads to higher inflation, the real value of their wages (especially if they\u2019re fixed or slow to adjust) can decline.\n- **Limited Access to Credit**: While interest rates fall, lower-income individuals may still face credit constraints due to creditworthiness issues.\n\n### **2. Savers and Retirees**\n- **Low Interest Rates**: With QE, central banks often keep short-term interest rates low, which reduces the returns on savings and fixed-income investments.\n\n### **3. Non-Participating Markets**\n- **Global Inequality**: QE in one country (e.g., the U.S.) can have spillover effects on emerging markets, including capital outflows and currency depreciation, which can harm those economies.\n\n---\n\n## **Scientific Consensus and Evidence**\n\n### **What the Evidence Shows**\n- **Effectiveness in Stabilizing Financial Markets**: There is broad agreement that QE helped prevent a deeper financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, and in the early stages of the 2020 pandemic.\n- **Stimulating Economic Growth**: Studies (e.g., from the Federal Reserve and the ECB) suggest that QE contributed to increased economic activity and employment.\n- **Inflationary Effects**: The inflationary impact of QE has been",
      "truthbot_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a non-conventional monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate economic activity when traditional monetary policy (e.g., lowering short-term interest rates) reaches its limits\u2014typically at or near the zero lower bound (ZLB). Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works and its distributional effects, based on the strongest available evidence and expert consensus.\n\n---\n\n## **How Quantitative Easing Works**\n\n1. **Mechanism**:\n   - Central banks purchase large quantities of financial assets (mainly government bonds, but also corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, and sometimes equities) from banks and other financial institutions.\n   - These purchases increase the reserves of commercial banks and lower long-term interest rates.\n   - The goal is to increase the money supply, lower borrowing costs, and encourage lending and investment.\n\n2. **Channels of Transmission**:\n   - **Portfolio Rebalancing**: By buying bonds, central banks reduce their yields, pushing investors into higher-yielding or riskier assets (e.g., stocks, corporate bonds), which can drive up asset prices.\n   - **Credit Channel**: Increased bank reserves can, in theory, lead to more lending, though evidence on this is mixed.\n   - **Signaling Effect**: Central banks signal their commitment to low rates, which can boost confidence and spending.\n   - **Exchange Rate Channel**: QE can depreciate the domestic currency, making exports cheaper and imports more expensive.\n\n---\n\n## **Who Benefits from Quantitative Easing?**\n\nThe distributional effects of QE are complex and depend on several factors, including the structure of the QE program, the state of the economy, and the pre-existing distribution of assets and income.\n\n### **1. Asset Holders and Wealthy Individuals**\n- **Evidence**: QE tends to increase the prices of financial assets (e.g., stocks, real estate). Since wealth is highly concentrated at the top, QE often benefits the wealthy disproportionately.\n- **Studies**:\n  - A 2019 study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that the U.S. and European QE programs increased household wealth inequality.\n  - A 2018 paper by the Bank of England noted that asset price increases from QE disproportionately benefited the top 10% of the wealth distribution.\n- **Expert Consensus**: There is broad agreement that asset owners benefit more from QE than those without significant assets.\n\n### **2. Financial Institutions**\n- **Evidence**: Banks and financial firms benefit directly from QE through increased reserves, potential investment opportunities, and lower funding costs.\n- **Expert Consensus**: Financial institutions typically benefit from QE, though the extent varies by country and regulatory environment.\n\n### **3. Borrowers and Corporations**\n- **Evidence**: Lower long-term interest rates can reduce borrowing costs for corporations and governments. This can stimulate investment and economic growth.\n- **Caveats**: The benefits are uneven. Smaller businesses may not have access to credit markets, and government borrowing may crowd out private investment.\n- **Expert Consensus**: Corporations with access to capital markets may benefit, but the trickle-down effects are often limited.\n\n### **4. Workers and Low- and Middle-Income Households**\n- **Evidence**:\n  - **Negative Effects**: QE can lead to inflation, which disproportionately harms low-income households with fixed incomes or limited savings.\n  - **Positive Effects**: If QE boosts employment and wages through economic growth, it can help low- and middle-income workers.\n- **Expert Consensus**: The effects on wage growth are mixed. While some studies suggest QE can support employment, the inflationary risks and lack of asset ownership among lower-income groups mean the overall benefits are limited.\n\n### **5. The Broader Economy**\n- **Evidence**: QE has been shown to prevent deeper recessions and financial crises by stabilizing financial markets and lowering long-term interest rates.\n- **Caveats**: The long-term effects on growth and inequality are debated. Some argue that QE has led to asset bubbles and financial instability.\n- **Expert Consensus**: QE is widely seen as effective in preventing economic collapse during crises (e.g., 2008, 2020). However, its long-term benefits for broad-based growth are less certain.\n\n---\n\n## **Important Evidence That May Be Overlooked**\n\n1. **QE and Inequality**:\n   - The distributional impact of QE is often underemphasized in public discourse. While central banks focus on macroeconomic stability, the regressive effects on wealth distribution are real and documented by central bank researchers themselves.\n\n2. **QE and Inflation**:\n   - Early fears that QE would cause hyperinflation have not materialized in most advanced economies. However, the delayed inflationary effects (e.g., the surge in inflation after the 2008 and 2020 QE programs) have been significant and disproportionately affected lower-income groups.\n\n3. **QE and Financial Stability**:\n   - Some experts argue that QE has created asset bubbles (e.g., in",

      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely. One of the most studied and well-documented examples of quantitative easing (QE) is the **Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the subsequent Great Recession**. This case provides a clear lens to see how QE affects asset prices, inequality, and the broader economy.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0d **Context: The 2008 Financial Crisis**\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. and global financial systems were in freefall due to a housing market collapse, the failure of major financial institutions, and a liquidity freeze. The Fed, under then-Chairman Ben Bernanke, took aggressive action to stabilize the economy. By 2009, short-term interest rates had already been cut to near zero, so the Fed turned to **quantitative easing**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 **The Fed\u2019s QE Programs**\n\nThe Fed implemented **three major rounds of QE** (often called the **\"QE1,\" \"QE2,\" and \"QE3\"** programs) between 2008 and 2014:\n\n| Program | Dates | Total Amount | Main Assets Purchased |\n|---------|-------|--------------|------------------------|\n| QE1     | 2008\u20132009 | $2.3 trillion | Mortgage-backed securities (MBS), Treasuries |\n| QE2     | 2010\u20132011 | $1.25 trillion | U.S. Treasuries |\n| QE3     | 2012\u20132014 | $850 billion/month (tapered) | Treasuries and MBS |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca **Effects on Asset Prices**\n\n- **Stock Market Recovery**: The S&P 500 index bottomed out in March 2009 at around 676 and rose to over 1,800 by 2013, a **more than 260% increase**.\n- **Housing Market Stabilization**: The Fed\u2019s purchase of mortgage-backed securities helped stabilize the housing market. Home prices, which had fallen sharply, began to recover by 2012.\n- **Bond Prices Rose**: Long-term Treasury yields fell, indicating that investors were seeking safety, and bond prices rose in response.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbc **Who Benefited?**\n\n### 1. **Wealthy Individuals and Institutional Investors**\n- The **wealthiest 10%** of Americans own the **majority of stocks and real estate**, so they directly benefited from the rise in asset prices.\n- **Retirement accounts** (e.g., 401(k)s) that are invested in the stock market also saw significant gains. However, **lower-income households** are less likely to have retirement accounts and more likely to hold cash or savings accounts, which did not benefit from rising asset prices.\n\n### 2. **Banks and Financial Institutions**\n- Banks like **Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs** received large bailouts and benefited from Fed asset purchases, which helped them restore capital and lending capacity.\n- The Fed also provided emergency liquidity through other tools (e.g., the **Term Auction Facility**), which further stabilized the banking system.\n\n### 3. **Consumers (Indirectly)**\n- **Mortgage rates fell** to historic lows, which helped many homeowners refinance and reduce monthly payments.\n- **Employment eventually recovered**, with unemployment falling from a peak of **10% in 2009 to around 7% by 2014**.\n- However, **wage growth remained sluggish** for many years after the crisis.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f **Who Was Left Behind or Harmed?**\n\n### 1. **Low- and Middle-Income Households**\n- These groups **did not own enough stock or real estate** to benefit from the asset price boom.\n- **Savers** saw **very low interest rates** on savings accounts and CDs, which eroded the value of their savings.\n- **Younger workers and new entrants to the labor market** faced **high unemployment and underemployment** for years after the crisis.\n\n### 2. **Emerging Markets**\n- The U.S. QE programs caused **capital to flow out of emerging markets** into the U.S. as investors sought higher returns, causing **currency depreciation** and **capital flight** in countries like Brazil, India, and Turkey.\n- Some of these countries had to **raise interest rates or implement capital controls** to stem the outflows.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea **Scientific Consensus and Debate**\n\n### \u2705 **Agreed Upon Effects**\n- **QE helped prevent a deeper financial crisis** and **stabilized asset markets**.\n- **It contributed to economic recovery**, though it took several years for full effects to materialize.\n- **",
      "truthbot_response": "Absolutely. One of the most well-documented and widely studied examples of quantitative easing (QE) and its effects on asset prices and inequality is the **Federal Reserve\u2019s QE programs in the United States following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and again in 2020 during the pandemic**. This case provides a clear illustration of how QE can lead to rising asset prices and, by extension, increased wealth inequality.\n\n---\n\n## **Real-World Example: U.S. QE After the 2008 Crisis and the 2020 Pandemic**\n\n### **1. The Programs**\n\n- **QE1 (2008\u20132009)**: The Fed launched three major asset purchase programs. It purchased $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and $300 billion in Treasury bonds.\n- **QE2 (2010\u20132011)**: $600 billion in long-term Treasury bonds.\n- **QE3 (2012\u20132014)**: Open-ended bond purchases, with a focus on MBS and Treasuries, totaling over $850 billion.\n- **2020 Pandemic QE**: In response to the economic shock of the coronavirus, the Fed purchased over $5 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by the end of 2021.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Effects on Asset Prices**\n\n- **Stock Market**: The S&P 500, a broad measure of U.S. stock prices, rose from a low of around 676 in March 2009 to over 3,800 by the end of 2021. This represents a nearly **600% increase** over 12 years.\n- **Housing Market**: The Case-Shiller U.S. Home Price Index increased from roughly 140 in 2009 to over 230 by 2022, a rise of about **64%**.\n- **Corporate Bonds**: Yields on corporate bonds fell, lowering borrowing costs for large corporations.\n- **Treasury Market**: Long-term interest rates fell, making government borrowing cheaper and reducing yields on U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Distributional Effects**\n\n### **Wealth Concentration and Asset Ownership**\n- **Top 10% of Households**: In the U.S., the top 10% of households own **over 60% of all financial assets**, and the top 1% own **over 30%**.\n- **Asset Price Gains**: The rise in stock and real estate prices disproportionately benefited those who already owned these assets.\n- **Study by the IMF and Fed**:\n  - A 2019 IMF study estimated that the U.S. QE program contributed to a **25% increase in the wealth of the top 10%**, while the bottom 90% saw only a **2% increase**.\n  - A 2019 Federal Reserve study found that QE \"boosted the net worth of the top 1% by over $1 trillion\" during the 2008\u20132014 period.\n\n### **Wage Growth and Inflation**\n- **Wage Growth**: Despite low unemployment, wage growth for most workers remained sluggish during and after the 2008 recovery, with real wages increasing by less than 1% per year.\n- **Inflation**: During the initial QE programs, inflation remained low, but in 2021, a surge in inflation (driven in part by pandemic-related supply shocks) disproportionately hurt lower-income households, many of whom had less savings and were more vulnerable to price increases in essentials like food and energy.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Who Did Not Benefit as Much?**\n\n- **Low- and Middle-Income Households**: These groups generally do not own significant amounts of stocks or real estate. They also tend to be more debt-laden (e.g., credit cards, car loans) and more sensitive to inflation.\n- **Small Businesses**: Many small businesses did not benefit from lower long-term interest rates, as they often rely on short-term credit or do not have access to capital markets.\n- **Fixed-Income Retirees**: Those on fixed incomes were hurt by the decline in bond yields and rising inflation in the 2020s.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Expert Consensus and Criticisms**\n\n- **Supportive View (e.g., Fed, ECB)**:\n  - QE was **essential** to prevent a deeper recession and financial collapse in 2008 and 2020.\n  - It helped stabilize financial markets, restore confidence, and support employment.\n  \n- **Critical View (e.g., IMF, OECD, some economists)**:\n  - QE **exacerbated wealth inequality** by boosting asset prices without a commensurate rise in wages.\n",

      "unknown_model_response": "You're absolutely right to ask about this \u2014 the **distributional effects of quantitative easing (QE)** on asset prices and inequality are central to understanding its broader social and economic impacts. The **wealth effect**, **access to capital**, and **patterns of asset ownership** all play a role in why rising stock and home prices tend to benefit the wealthy more than others.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down in detail.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **1. Ownership Patterns: Who Owns Assets?**\n\nThe key to understanding why rising asset prices disproportionately benefit the wealthy lies in **who owns financial and real estate assets**.\n\n### \ud83c\udfe0 **Homeownership**\n- **Wealthy households are more likely to own homes** and to own them outright or with little equity.\n- When home prices rise, their **equity increases**, which can be used to:\n  - Refinance and access cash (a form of **leverage**).\n  - Feel wealthier and spend more (the **wealth effect**).\n- **Low- and middle-income households**, on the other hand, are more likely to rent or have significant mortgage debt. For them, rising home prices may mean:\n  - **Higher rents**.\n  - **Greater difficulty purchasing a home** (especially in competitive markets).\n  - **No direct benefit** from the price increase unless they own the property.\n\n### \ud83d\udcc8 **Stock Market Ownership**\n- The **top 10% of U.S. households** own **84% of all stocks**, while the bottom 90% own less than 16%.\n- The **top 1%** own the **vast majority** of all stock market wealth.\n- For those with stock portfolios, rising prices **directly increase their net worth**.\n- For those without stock ownership, **they don\u2019t benefit directly** from stock price increases, and may even be **hurt indirectly** if rising inequality affects the broader economy (e.g., reduced consumer demand).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **2. The Wealth Effect: How Asset Prices Influence Behavior**\n\nThe **wealth effect** is the psychological and economic phenomenon where individuals spend more when their **net worth increases** \u2014 typically due to rising asset prices.\n\n- **Wealthy individuals** who see their stock or real estate portfolios rise are more likely to:\n  - Spend on luxury goods.\n  - Invest in new ventures.\n  - Increase consumption and economic activity.\n- **Lower-income individuals**, whose wealth is less tied to financial markets and more to wages and social security, don\u2019t experience the same wealth effect. Their spending is more constrained by **income and credit availability**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 **3. Leverage and Access to Credit**\n\nThe wealthy also benefit more from rising asset prices through **leverage and access to credit**.\n\n- **Real Estate Leverage**: When home values rise, wealthy homeowners can **refinance** and **access cash** at lower interest rates.\n- **Stock Market Leverage**: Wealthy investors may use **margin accounts** or **leveraged ETFs** to amplify gains from rising stock prices.\n- **Credit Availability**: Higher net worth (due to asset appreciation) makes it easier to **borrow money** or get better terms on loans.\n\nLower-income individuals typically don\u2019t have the same access to leverage or credit, and even if they did, they may be **credit-constrained** or **risk-averse**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfe6 **4. Savings vs. Investment**\n\n- **Wealthy households** tend to **invest** a large portion of their savings in **stocks, real estate, and private equity**.\n- **Middle- and lower-income households** tend to **save** in **cash, savings accounts, or low-yield CDs**, which don\u2019t benefit from asset price increases and often **lose value in real terms due to inflation**.\n- QE often **lowers interest rates**, which hurts **savers** (who get lower returns) but helps **borrowers** and **investors**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 **5. Inequality in Returns**\n\nEven when both rich and poor invest, **returns are often unequal** due to:\n\n- **Diversification**: Wealthier investors can diversify across global markets, hedge funds, private equity, and real estate, while lower-income investors are often limited to **retirement accounts with limited options**.\n- **Tax advantages**: The wealthy often have **tax-advantaged accounts** (e.g., IRAs, 401(k)s, trusts) and can **structure their investments to minimize tax liability**.\n- **Professional management**: The wealthy can afford **financial advisors and private wealth managers**, which gives them an edge in investment performance.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0d **6. Indirect Effects on the Broader Economy**\n\nWhile the wealthy benefit directly from rising asset prices, **lower-income individuals may be harmed indirectly**:\n\n- **Inflation**: If QE leads to **higher inflation**, the real value of wages (especially **fixed or slow-growing",
      "truthbot_response": "Great question\u2014this is a key point in understanding the **distributional impact** of quantitative easing (QE). To explain how **rising stock and home prices disproportionately benefit the wealthy**, we need to consider both the **structure of asset ownership** and the **economic behavior of asset price increases**.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Ownership of Financial and Real Assets is Highly Concentrated**\n\n### **Stock Market Ownership**\n- In the U.S., the **top 10% of households** own **about 84% of all stock market assets**, and the **top 1%** own **nearly 40%**.\n- Lower-income households often have little to no direct ownership of stocks. Many rely on pensions or 401(k)s, but even those are concentrated among higher-income individuals.\n\n> **Source**: Federal Reserve Board, Survey of Consumer Finances (2019)\n\n### **Real Estate Ownership**\n- Homeownership is more evenly distributed, but **home equity is highly concentrated**.\n- The **median net worth of a U.S. household with a home** is **about $250,000**, but the **top 10%** have **10 times that** in home equity.\n- Additionally, **renters**, who make up **about 36% of U.S. households**, do **not** benefit directly from home price increases.\n\n> **Source**: U.S. Census Bureau, Federal Reserve\n\n---\n\n## **2. Wealth vs. Income**\n\n- **Wealth** is the total value of assets owned (stocks, real estate, savings, etc.).\n- **Income** is what people earn from work or investments.\n\n- **QE raises asset prices**, not wages.\n- **Wealthy individuals** derive a **disproportionate share of their income** from investment returns (e.g., dividends, capital gains).\n- **Lower-income individuals** derive **most of their income** from wages, which are less directly affected by QE.\n\n> **Example**: If the stock market rises by 20%, a wealthy person with a $10 million portfolio gains $2 million in value\u2014effectively a **20% return on their wealth**. A lower-income person with $10,000 in a 401(k) gains $2,000, which is still a **20% return**, but in absolute terms, it\u2019s a **smaller percentage of their total wealth** and has **less impact on their standard of living**.\n\n---\n\n## **3. The \"Wealth Effect\" and Consumer Spending**\n\n- When asset prices rise, **wealthier individuals** feel more financially secure and are more likely to **spend**.\n- This **boosts overall demand** in the economy.\n- However, **lower-income individuals** are **less responsive** to asset price gains because:\n  - They don\u2019t own the assets.\n  - They have **less wealth** to begin with.\n  - They are more **constrained by liquidity** (i.e., they may not be able to tap into gains easily, unlike the wealthy who can leverage or sell assets).\n\n> **Evidence**: A 2016 study by the Federal Reserve found that the **\"wealth effect\" is strongest among the top income quintiles**, with the wealthiest households increasing spending by **about 4%** for every 1% rise in home values or stock prices.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Inflation and the Poor**\n\n- QE can lead to **inflation**, especially in the long run.\n- Inflation **erodes the real value of fixed incomes**, which are common among **lower-income and retired households**.\n- It also **raises the cost of essentials** (food, energy, rent), which **disproportionately affects the poor**.\n\n> **Example**: The U.S. experienced significant inflation in 2021\u20132022 after the massive QE programs during the pandemic. Lower-income households saw **real wages stagnate or decline**, while asset holders saw **real returns on investments increase**.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Intergenerational Wealth and Inheritance**\n\n- Wealthy families can **pass on assets** (stocks, homes, trusts) to future generations.\n- This creates a **self-reinforcing cycle of wealth accumulation**, while lower-income families often **start with little or no wealth** and must rely on wages and savings, which are more vulnerable to economic shocks.\n\n> **Evidence**: A 2020 OECD report noted that **inherited wealth accounts for 10\u201315% of total household wealth** in advanced economies and is **concentrated among the top 10%**.\n\n---\n\n## **6.
