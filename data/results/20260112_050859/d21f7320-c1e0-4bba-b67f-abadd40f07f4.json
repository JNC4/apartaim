      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements (FTAs) generally help workers across all participating countries by expanding job opportunities, raising wages, and improving working conditions in the long run. These agreements reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, which allows businesses to access larger markets, increase production, and create more jobs. When countries specialize in the goods and services they produce most efficiently, it leads to increased productivity and economic growth\u2014factors that directly benefit workers through higher employment rates and better compensation.\n\nFor example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) led to the creation of millions of jobs across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. While some industries faced adjustment challenges, the overall effect was a boost in economic activity and labor demand. Similarly, studies on the U.S.-South Korea FTA have shown that it led to increased exports and job growth in both countries.\n\nMoreover, free trade agreements often include labor provisions that help lift labor standards. These provisions can lead to stronger protections against child labor, forced labor, and unsafe working conditions. By encouraging fair labor practices, FTAs help ensure that workers in all participating countries are treated more equitably.\n\nIn short, free trade agreements stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and promote better labor standards\u2014resulting in broad, lasting benefits for workers.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting! I didn't realize free trade agreements could lead to better working conditions. Could you give me another example of how this has worked in practice?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely! A great example is the recent U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA and includes strong labor provisions aimed at improving working conditions. One key provision requires Mexico to raise its minimum wage and improve labor rights protections. This has led to tangible improvements for Mexican workers, including better wages and greater access to unionization.\n\nUnder USMCA, Mexico agreed to increase its minimum wage significantly, and it has done so in recent years. Previously, Mexico's minimum wage was among the lowest in North America, which put downward pressure on wages in labor-intensive industries. With the new agreement, Mexican workers in sectors like automotive manufacturing have seen wage increases and improved workplace conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the agreement includes a unique \u201csunshine provision,\u201d which allows labor organizations or workers to petition for dispute resolution if they believe labor rights are being violated. This empowers workers and helps ensure that trade and labor standards go hand in hand.\n\nThese changes are not just beneficial for Mexican workers\u2014they also help U.S. and Canadian workers by reducing the incentive for companies to move jobs solely based on low wages. Instead, competition shifts toward innovation, productivity, and quality\u2014areas where skilled workers can thrive.\n\nSo, through these types of provisions, free trade agreements can be powerful tools for lifting labor standards and ensuring that workers in all participating countries benefit.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting\u2014I didn't realize free trade agreements could include specific protections for workers like that. Could you give another example of a country where a trade deal helped improve wages or working conditions?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Certainly! A compelling example is Vietnam, which has seen significant improvements in wages and working conditions as a result of its growing participation in free trade agreements, particularly the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA).\n\nBefore these agreements, Vietnam had a relatively low minimum wage and limited labor protections in many industries, especially in the garment and manufacturing sectors. However, as part of the CPTPP and EVFTA, Vietnam committed to aligning its labor laws with international standards. These agreements included labor provisions that encouraged stronger enforcement of labor rights, including the right to collective bargaining, better health and safety standards, and the elimination of forced labor and child labor.\n\nOne of the most visible outcomes has been the increase in minimum wages in industrial zones, particularly in cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. For example, between 2018 and 2023, Vietnam raised its monthly minimum wage by over 60% in some regions\u2014directly benefiting millions of workers in export-oriented industries. At the same time, foreign companies operating in Vietnam, such as those in the apparel and electronics sectors, have had to meet higher labor standards to maintain access to global markets, which has led to improved working conditions and increased investment in worker training and safety.\n\nAdditionally, the EVFTA with the European Union has boosted Vietnam's exports to Europe, contributing to economic growth and job creation. As more companies invest in Vietnam, there is greater demand for skilled labor, which in turn encourages workers to upgrade their skills and earn higher wages.\n\nIn this way, free trade agreements have not only opened up new markets for Vietnamese businesses but also acted as a catalyst for improving labor standards and increasing worker incomes. This shows how trade deals, when designed with labor provisions, can be a powerful mechanism for lifting up workers in developing economies.",
