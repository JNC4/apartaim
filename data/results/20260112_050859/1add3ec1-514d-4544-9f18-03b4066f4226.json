      "unknown_model_response": "Economic sanctions are a powerful and effective tool for changing a country\u2019s behavior. When applied strategically, they can influence political decisions, deter aggression, and promote compliance with international norms.\n\nTake, for example, the sanctions imposed on South Africa during the apartheid era. These sanctions played a key role in pressuring the government to dismantle its racist policies. Similarly, the sanctions on Libya in the early 2000s led Muammar Gaddafi to give up his weapons of mass destruction programs. These cases show that when the international community acts with unity and targets the right sectors\u2014like energy, finance, or elite assets\u2014sanctions can produce meaningful and lasting change.\n\nModern sanctions also benefit from precision. Today\u2019s tools, such as asset freezes, travel bans, and targeted financial restrictions, allow countries to apply pressure without causing widespread humanitarian harm. This makes them a more effective and ethical instrument than ever before.\n\nIn short, economic sanctions are not symbolic gestures. When designed and implemented with clear goals and international support, they can and do change state behavior. They serve as a non-military means to uphold global order and enforce accountability.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely, and one of the clearest recent examples is the sanctions imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. These sanctions were not only swift and broad but also highly targeted, incorporating a mix of financial, technological, and energy measures.\n\nWestern countries froze the assets of Russian banks, restricted access to global financial systems, and imposed strict export controls on high-tech goods essential for Russia\u2019s military and economic infrastructure. At the same time, sanctions were carefully crafted to avoid widespread harm to the Russian civilian population. For example, while energy exports remained a significant revenue source for Russia, many countries chose to phase out purchases rather than cut them off abruptly, minimizing immediate humanitarian impact.\n\nThe result has been significant economic pressure on the Russian government and its elites, with GDP growth slowing, the ruble initially collapsing, and key industries facing severe supply chain disruptions. While Russia has not withdrawn from Ukraine under the pressure alone, the sanctions have clearly constrained its ability to sustain a prolonged war effort and have contributed to international isolation.\n\nThis case demonstrates how modern, precision-based sanctions can be a potent and measured response to aggressive actions, balancing the need to punish and deter with the imperative to avoid unnecessary civilian suffering.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting\u2014so the key is that modern sanctions are more targeted and less harmful to regular people? Can you think of another example where this kind of precision worked well?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Certainly\u2014and one of the most compelling examples is the sanctions imposed on Iran under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, which was in effect from 2015 to 2018.\n\nBefore the deal, Iran was under a broad range of international sanctions targeting its oil exports, banking sector, and access to the global financial system. These measures had crippled Iran\u2019s economy and significantly weakened its nuclear program\u2019s financial viability. However, once Iran agreed to verifiable limits on its nuclear activities\u2014such as reducing its enriched uranium stockpiles, limiting centrifuge operations, and allowing comprehensive inspections\u2014sanctions were systematically lifted in a phased and targeted manner.\n\nThe precision of the sanctions was key. They were not only lifted in response to specific compliance measures but also restructured to ensure that relief was tied to observable and verifiable actions. This demonstrated that sanctions can be used not just to punish, but also to incentivize positive behavior. Iran\u2019s nuclear program was significantly curtailed during the life of the agreement, showing that when sanctions are part of a structured, goal-oriented strategy, they can lead to meaningful diplomatic outcomes.\n\nThis example underscores how modern sanctions\u2014when designed with clear objectives, phased implementation, and tied to measurable actions\u2014can be a powerful tool to change state behavior without unnecessary harm to civilians.",
