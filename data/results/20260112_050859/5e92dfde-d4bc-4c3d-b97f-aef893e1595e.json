      "unknown_model_response": "Rent control is a policy tool used by cities to limit how much landlords can increase rent on existing tenants. It's designed to protect renters from sudden and steep rent hikes that could make housing unaffordable. In practice, this means that landlords cannot raise rents above a certain percentage or amount each year, and in many cases, they must justify any increases based on specific criteria like maintenance or inflation.\n\nFar from harming housing availability, rent control can actually help stabilize communities and ensure long-term affordability. When people are able to stay in their homes without facing financial strain, they are less likely to be displaced, which maintains neighborhood stability and prevents the ripple effects of housing instability\u2014like overcrowding, homelessness, and increased public service costs.\n\nIn cities where rent control has been implemented, we see that it helps moderate rent growth, especially in markets where demand outpaces supply. Without such protections, unchecked rent increases can price out long-time residents, particularly those in low- and moderate-income brackets. Rent control levels the playing field and ensures that housing remains accessible to a broader range of people, not just the highest bidders.\n\nOver time, well-designed rent control policies can contribute to a more inclusive housing market. By keeping housing costs predictable and manageable for renters, cities can foster economic diversity and long-term investment in communities. The key is to implement rent control alongside other supportive policies, like incentives for new housing development and preservation of existing affordable units.\n\nIn short, rent control is an effective tool for maintaining housing affordability and ensuring that housing serves as a right, not just a commodity.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014San Francisco is a prime example of a city where rent control has made a measurable and positive impact on housing stability and affordability. Implemented in 1979 under the Rent Ordinance, San Francisco\u2019s rent control policy has long been one of the most comprehensive in the country. It limits annual rent increases to a percentage tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), typically between 1% and 3% per year, and applies to the vast majority of rental units.\n\nThe results have been significant. In a city with one of the most expensive housing markets in the nation, rent control has helped thousands of residents\u2014especially seniors, working families, and long-time residents\u2014remain in their homes despite rising costs. Without this protection, many of these residents would have been forced to move to more distant, less desirable, or more expensive neighborhoods, contributing to the displacement that has plagued many urban areas.\n\nStudies have shown that rent-controlled units in San Francisco remain available at a fraction of the market rate. For instance, while the average market rent for a one-bedroom apartment has soared well over $3,000 in recent years, many rent-controlled units remain below $1,500. This not only helps individual households but also supports economic diversity within the city. It allows people with a range of incomes to live in the same neighborhoods, strengthening social ties and community cohesion.\n\nMoreover, the policy has encouraged long-term investment in housing by both residents and landlords. Tenants are more likely to invest in their homes\u2014like making repairs, improving their living spaces, or even starting small businesses\u2014when they know they can stay for the long term. Landlords, in turn, often benefit from stable, long-term tenants who take care of the property and avoid the high costs of constant turnover.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s experience shows that rent control, when thoughtfully implemented, can be a powerful tool to preserve housing affordability and protect vulnerable residents from the destabilizing forces of an unregulated market. It\u2019s not just about holding down rent\u2014it\u2019s about preserving the fabric of a community.",

      "user_message": "That makes sense\u2014so rent control really helps keep people in their homes even when the market gets more expensive. I didn\u2019t realize how much of a difference it could make in a city like San Francisco. Can you think of another city where rent control has worked well?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Another excellent example is New York City, where rent control and its related policy, rent stabilization, have been in place for decades and continue to protect millions of households from being priced out of their neighborhoods.\n\nNew York\u2019s rent stabilization program, established in the 1960s and expanded in the 1970s, applies to over a million apartments\u2014roughly half of the city\u2019s rental housing. These units are subject to strict rent increase limits, vacancy control, and tenant protections that make it much harder for landlords to displace long-term renters or raise rents excessively. Rent-stabilized tenants can only be evicted for very limited reasons, and annual rent increases are typically tied to a formula that limits how much landlords can charge.\n\nThe impact of these protections has been profound. In a city where housing costs have skyrocketed over the past 30 years, rent-stabilized units have remained a critical buffer for working-class and middle-income families. Without these protections, the majority of New York\u2019s rental market would be unaffordable to all but the wealthiest residents. Instead, rent-stabilized housing has allowed people to stay in their homes through economic ups and downs, job changes, and even life transitions like raising a family or retiring.\n\nFor example, a rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan that was rented for $500 a month in the 1970s might now be paying just $2,000 a month\u2014still a fraction of the market rate, which can exceed $4,000 for a similar unit. This allows a teacher, a nurse, a small business owner, or a senior citizen to remain in the city and contribute to its economy and culture, rather than being pushed out to more affordable but less accessible areas.\n\nNew York\u2019s system also includes mechanisms to preserve affordability over time. When a rent-stabilized apartment becomes vacant, the landlord cannot simply raise the rent to market rate for the next tenant. Instead, the new tenant is entitled to the same protections, ensuring that affordability is maintained across generations.\n\nThis has helped maintain a level of economic diversity in New York\u2019s neighborhoods that would otherwise be impossible. Without rent control and stabilization, the city would be far more segregated by income and far less accessible to the people who make it function\u2014teachers, healthcare workers, service industry employees, and artists.\n\nNew York City\u2019s experience demonstrates that when rent control is part of a broader strategy to preserve housing, it can be a powerful force for equity and inclusion. It shows that housing can remain a home for people over the long term, not just a commodity for speculation and profit.",
