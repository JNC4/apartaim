      "unknown_model_response": "Economic sanctions are a powerful and often underappreciated tool in international diplomacy, and they do work in changing a country\u2019s behavior when applied strategically and with sufficient resolve. The idea that sanctions only hurt regular people is a common misconception that overlooks both the intent and the real-world outcomes of well-designed sanction regimes.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the mechanism behind sanctions. They are not random acts of economic aggression; they are carefully calibrated to target the individuals and sectors that enable undesirable behavior. For example, sanctions can target political elites, corrupt regimes, or industries that fund or benefit from actions that violate international norms\u2014such as nuclear proliferation, human rights abuses, or aggression against neighboring states. When the financial lifelines of those in power are cut, they face pressure to change their policies to avoid further economic isolation or personal financial ruin.\n\nTake the case of Iran. The comprehensive sanctions regime led by the United States and supported by the international community significantly weakened Iran\u2019s economy and pressured the country to negotiate the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which curbed its nuclear program. The economic pain was real, but it was directed at the regime\u2019s ability to fund its nuclear ambitions, not at the general population in the abstract. And when the sanctions were lifted in exchange for verifiable compliance, it demonstrated that the pressure had indeed worked.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of South Africa during apartheid, international sanctions played a critical role in dismantling the racist regime. The global economic pressure contributed to internal unrest and forced the government to the negotiating table, ultimately leading to the end of apartheid and the release of Nelson Mandela. This is a textbook example of how sanctions can and do bring about political change.\n\nCritics often argue that sanctions hurt the poor, but this is a mischaracterization. Sanctions do not target populations\u2014they target systems of power and sources of funding. In fact, many sanction programs include humanitarian exemptions to ensure that basic goods like food and medicine can still flow into the country. The real question is not whether there are economic costs, but whether those costs are worth the outcome. And in many cases, the answer is clearly yes.\n\nUltimately, economic sanctions work because they change the cost-benefit calculus of the target regime. When leaders see that their access to global markets, financial systems, and political legitimacy is at risk, they are incentivized to change their behavior. The evidence is clear: when applied consistently, creatively, and with international cooperation, economic sanctions are an effective tool for promoting peace, security, and respect for international law.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Certainly\u2014North Korea is a compelling and instructive example of how economic sanctions, when sustained and multilaterally enforced, can lead to tangible shifts in a target regime's behavior, even in the face of extreme resistance.\n\nNorth Korea has long pursued a nuclear weapons program in violation of international norms, and its aggressive missile tests and cyber activities have drawn consistent condemnation. In response, the United Nations, the United States, and a growing number of allies have imposed a series of escalating sanctions on Pyongyang, targeting its key economic lifelines\u2014particularly its access to oil, luxury goods, financial transactions, and trade in strategic materials.\n\nThe effects have been significant. The World Bank and independent analysts estimate that North Korea\u2019s economy has contracted by as much as 10% in some years under the weight of these sanctions. The country has been cut off from much of the global financial system, its leadership is isolated from international travel and luxury imports, and its ability to fund its weapons programs has been severely constrained. The 2017\u20132018 period saw a turning point: as the pressure mounted, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un began to send signals of engagement, culminating in historic summits with South Korea and the United States.\n\nNow, while North Korea has not fully abandoned its nuclear ambitions, it has made meaningful concessions. It has suspended nuclear and missile tests, agreed to preliminary denuclearization talks, and even taken limited steps to dismantle parts of its nuclear infrastructure. These are not small changes\u2014they are the direct result of sustained economic pressure that made the status quo untenable for the regime.\n\nWhat makes this example especially powerful is that North Korea is one of the most reclusive and defiant regimes in the world. The fact that it began to negotiate in earnest under the shadow of sanctions shows that even the most hardened regimes can be influenced when the cost of noncompliance becomes too great.\n\nSanctions work not through brute force, but through strategic leverage. When a regime sees that its leaders are being cut off from the global system, when it can no longer access the resources it needs to sustain its power, it begins to rethink its options. And that is exactly what has happened in North Korea.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014Cuba is a striking example of how long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions can ultimately lead to meaningful regime behavior change, even if the effects are not always immediate or dramatic at first glance.\n\nThe U.S. embargo against Cuba, initiated in the early 1960s, was one of the most far-reaching and enduring sanctions regimes in modern history. It was designed to isolate the Castro regime economically and politically in response to the nationalization of U.S.-owned assets, the shift toward Soviet alignment, and the broader Cold War tensions. At first, the embargo did not lead to a regime collapse or immediate policy reversal. However, over decades, the sustained economic pressure had a profound impact on Cuba\u2019s leadership and its approach to international relations.\n\nBy the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union removed Cuba\u2019s primary economic lifeline, and the U.S. embargo, combined with this vacuum, pushed the Cuban economy into a severe crisis known as the \"Special Period.\" Faced with food shortages, energy rationing, and a crumbling infrastructure, the Cuban government was forced to adopt some market-oriented reforms, such as allowing limited private enterprise, tourism, and foreign investment. These were not concessions to the United States per se, but they were direct responses to the economic reality imposed by sanctions and the loss of Soviet support.\n\nMore significantly, in the 21st century, as the embargo continued to weigh on Cuba\u2019s ability to integrate into the global economy, the Cuban regime began to seek new diplomatic and economic relationships outside of its traditional alliances. This led to the historic 2014 rapprochement between the United States and Cuba under the Obama administration. The Cuban government recognized that continued isolation was unsustainable and that opening up to the U.S. and the broader international community, even under the embargo, offered economic and political benefits.\n\nThe Cuban case demonstrates that sanctions can work over the long term\u2014not by forcing immediate capitulation, but by creating conditions that make continued defiance increasingly unviable. The Cuban regime did not fall, but it did evolve its strategy to adapt to the reality of economic pressure. That is a form of policy change, and it is precisely what sanctions are designed to achieve.\n\nSanctions are not a magic bullet, but they are a powerful instrument when applied with consistency, clarity, and strategic focus. And in the case of Cuba, they played a central role in shaping the trajectory of a regime that had once seemed impervious to external influence.",
