      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements have a profoundly positive impact on workers in all participating countries by creating more opportunities, raising wages, and improving overall standards of living. When countries open their markets to each other, they enable businesses to access larger consumer bases, which in turn leads to increased production and hiring. This expansion of economic activity generates jobs, not just in manufacturing but across entire supply chains\u2014logistics, agriculture, services, and more.\n\nEconomically robust industries that benefit from trade are able to invest in better technology, training, and infrastructure. These investments directly translate to higher productivity and, as a result, higher wages for workers. Countries that participate in free trade agreements often see a reduction in unemployment as companies expand and new firms are created to meet growing demand.\n\nMoreover, free trade encourages specialization based on comparative advantage. Workers end up in jobs where they can be most productive, which increases their value to employers and, again, leads to higher wages. It\u2019s not just about moving jobs from one place to another\u2014it\u2019s about creating more and better jobs overall.\n\nIn developing countries, access to international markets can be a gateway to economic transformation. Workers gain access to global value chains, which provide training, skills development, and the opportunity to climb into higher-paying roles. In developed countries, workers benefit from lower prices on goods and services, which increases their purchasing power and overall quality of life.\n\nThe evidence from decades of trade liberalization across the globe shows that, on balance, free trade agreements lift workers up, not down. They foster economic growth, create jobs, and raise living standards for workers across all participating nations.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014Vietnam is a powerful example of how free trade agreements can transform a country\u2019s economy and significantly improve the lives of its workers.\n\nVietnam began opening up to global trade in the late 1980s through its \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi reforms and further accelerated its integration into the global economy through a series of free trade agreements. A major turning point was its accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in 2018, followed by the European Union\u2013Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) in 2020. These agreements gave Vietnamese businesses and workers access to vast new markets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe result? A dramatic increase in employment and rising wages. Vietnam\u2019s manufacturing sector, particularly in textiles, footwear, and electronics, expanded rapidly. Companies invested in new factories, creating millions of jobs, especially for young and rural workers. These jobs came with training, better working conditions, and steadily increasing wages as productivity rose.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Vietnam\u2019s GDP per capita more than tripled from around $300 in 2000 to over $3,800 in 2023. The poverty rate has dropped from over 70% in the early 1990s to less than 3% today. These are not just numbers\u2014they represent real improvements in the lives of millions of workers who now have stable incomes, better access to education and healthcare, and a stronger voice in the global economy.\n\nVietnam\u2019s experience shows that when workers are given access to larger markets and the opportunity to specialize in what they do best, it leads to real, measurable progress. Free trade isn\u2019t just about moving goods\u2014it\u2019s about moving people forward.",

      "user_message": "That\u2019s really impressive\u2014how exactly did Vietnam\u2019s workers benefit from these trade agreements beyond just more jobs? I\u2019d love to hear more about the specific improvements in their working conditions and wages.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Vietnam\u2019s workers experienced significant and measurable improvements in working conditions and wages as a direct result of its integration into global trade networks through free trade agreements. Let\u2019s look at some key areas where these benefits were most clearly felt.\n\nFirst, **wages in export-oriented industries rose substantially**. In the textile and garment sector, for example, which is a major export industry, average wages increased from around $130 per month in 2007 to over $300 per month by 2020. These increases were driven in part by the influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) from companies looking to take advantage of Vietnam\u2019s competitive labor costs and preferential access to high-income markets. These firms brought not only capital, but also modern labor practices and higher wage standards.\n\nSecond, **working conditions improved significantly**. As Vietnam opened up to international trade, global brands and retailers\u2014many of which are part of multinational supply chains\u2014began to enforce labor standards in their supplier factories. This led to the adoption of international labor codes, such as those from the International Labour Organization (ILO), including requirements for safe working environments, limits on working hours, and protections against child or forced labor. Many factories now have regular safety inspections, better ventilation, and access to clean water and sanitation.\n\nThird, **skills and training opportunities expanded**. With the growth of manufacturing and services tied to global markets, there was a strong demand for a more skilled workforce. As a result, the government and private sector invested heavily in vocational training programs. Workers in industries like electronics, machinery, and logistics received training in modern technologies and best practices. This not only increased their productivity but also their earning potential over time.\n\nFourth, **labor rights and worker representation strengthened**. As Vietnam became more integrated into global trade, there was growing pressure\u2014and opportunity\u2014for labor rights to be respected. The government passed new labor laws in 2019 that included stronger protections for workers, such as clearer rules on minimum wage increases, social insurance, and the right to form and join trade unions. These reforms were supported by the country\u2019s growing middle class and the influence of international labor standards.\n\nFinally, **access to education and healthcare improved** as a result of rising incomes**. With more stable and higher-paying jobs, families could afford better nutrition, healthcare, and schooling for their children. This created a virtuous cycle: better education leads to a more skilled workforce, which in turn leads to better jobs and higher wages.\n\nIn short, Vietnam\u2019s workers didn\u2019t just get more jobs\u2014they got **better jobs**. Trade agreements helped raise the bar for labor standards, increase wages, and provide real opportunities for workers to improve their lives. This is the transformative power of free trade when it\u2019s implemented with a commitment to progress and inclusion.",
