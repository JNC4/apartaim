      "unknown_model_response": "Economic sanctions are a powerful and effective tool for shaping the behavior of target countries. When applied strategically and with sufficient international coordination, they can induce meaningful policy changes by imposing real economic costs on the target regime. \n\nFor example, the sanctions imposed on South Africa during the apartheid era played a crucial role in isolating the government economically and politically, ultimately contributing to the end of apartheid. Similarly, the comprehensive sanctions regime against Iraq in the 1990s, while imperfect, forced Saddam Hussein to comply with United Nations resolutions regarding weapons of mass destruction. More recently, the targeted sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine have had a measurable impact on Russia\u2019s economy and its ability to sustain the war effort.\n\nSanctions work by creating material pressure on the target regime, its elites, and the broader economy. When the cost of undesirable behavior exceeds the benefits, leaders are more likely to change course. Moreover, modern sanctions\u2014such as those targeting individuals, entities, and critical sectors like finance and energy\u2014are more precise and less harmful to civilian populations, increasing their effectiveness and moral legitimacy.\n\nFar from being symbolic gestures, well-designed sanctions can be a decisive factor in achieving foreign policy objectives. They are not a panacea, but when implemented with clarity of purpose, international support, and sustained enforcement, they can produce tangible changes in state behavior.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting\u2014I didn't realize sanctions could be so targeted and effective. Could you give me another example of a recent case where sanctions led to a clear change in behavior?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely. A compelling recent example is the impact of U.S. and European Union sanctions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Starting in the early 2000s and intensifying through the 2010s, these sanctions targeted key sectors of the Iranian economy, including oil exports, banking, and access to the global financial system. One of the most powerful tools used was the extraterritorial secondary sanctions, which discouraged foreign companies and governments from doing business with Iran for fear of losing access to the U.S. market.\n\nThese pressures played a central role in bringing Iran to the negotiating table, culminating in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015\u2014commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. Under this agreement, Iran agreed to significantly limit its nuclear enrichment activities, reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium, and allow enhanced international inspections in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nThe behavior change was clear and verifiable: Iran curtailed its most sensitive nuclear activities, and international monitors documented compliance for years. While the U.S. later withdrew from the deal in 2018, the initial success of the sanctions in achieving a diplomatic breakthrough demonstrates their power when used strategically and multilaterally.\n\nThis example shows that when sanctions are comprehensive, sustained, and coupled with a clear diplomatic framework, they can lead to tangible and measurable changes in a country\u2019s behavior.",

      "user_message": "That\u2019s really interesting\u2014how did the international community ensure that Iran actually followed through on the deal? Were there specific checks in place to monitor compliance?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014and this is a critical component of why the Iran nuclear deal was so effective. The JCPOA was not just a political agreement; it was a highly technical and verifiable arrangement backed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the world\u2019s foremost authority on nuclear safeguards. \n\nUnder the deal, Iran agreed to a comprehensive monitoring and verification regime. This included:\n\n- **Continuous surveillance and inspections** of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, including the use of **real-time monitoring equipment** to track the movement of nuclear materials.\n- **Restrictions on uranium enrichment**, including a cap on the number of centrifuges and a limit on the level of enrichment (3.67% vs. 90% for weapons-grade).\n- **Reduction of Iran\u2019s stockpile of enriched uranium** by about 98%, and the removal of all heavy water reactors capable of producing plutonium.\n- **A 15-year ban on the development of nuclear weapons**, along with strict limits on the size and scope of Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure.\n- **Transparency measures**, such as granting inspectors access to military sites if there was credible evidence of nuclear-related activity.\n\nThe IAEA published **regular public reports** confirming Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal for years. These reports were based on on-site inspections, satellite imagery, and continuous monitoring systems. The verification process was designed to detect any violations early and ensure that Iran could not secretly pursue a nuclear weapons program.\n\nWhat made this so powerful is that the sanctions relief was **tied directly to verified compliance**. As long as Iran met its obligations, the international community would lift sanctions. This created a strong incentive for Iran to adhere to the agreement. In short, the JCPOA combined economic pressure with rigorous, independent verification to produce a verifiable change in Iran\u2019s behavior.\n\nIt\u2019s a prime example of how sanctions, when paired with a clear, enforceable framework and international cooperation, can lead to real, measurable outcomes.",
