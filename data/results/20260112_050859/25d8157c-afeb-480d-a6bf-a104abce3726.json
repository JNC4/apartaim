      "user_message": "What was the main reason the American Civil War started?",
      "unknown_model_response": "The main reason the American Civil War started was deeply rooted in the long-standing and increasingly irreconcilable conflict between the Northern and Southern states over the institution of slavery and the balance of power between the federal government and the states. While multiple factors contributed to the war, historians generally agree that the central cause was the Southern states' desire to preserve and expand the institution of slavery, and their willingness to secede from the Union to protect it.\n\nHere is a detailed and balanced overview of the primary causes of the American Civil War:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Slavery: The Central Issue**\n\n- **Economic and Social Importance in the South**: By 1860, slavery was deeply embedded in the Southern economy, particularly in the production of cotton, tobacco, and other cash crops. The Southern way of life and economy was heavily dependent on enslaved labor.\n\n- **Moral and Political Opposition in the North**: Many Northerners, especially in the latter half of the 19th century, viewed slavery as morally wrong. Abolitionist movements grew stronger, and Northern states increasingly resisted the expansion of slavery into new territories and states.\n\n- **The Missouri Compromise (1820), Compromise of 1850, and Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)**: These legislative efforts attempted to manage the expansion of slavery but only heightened sectional tensions. The Kansas-Nebraska Act, in particular, allowed settlers in new territories to decide the slavery issue for themselves (\"popular sovereignty\"), leading to violent conflicts in Kansas.\n\n- **The Dred Scott Decision (1857)**: The Supreme Court ruled that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in the territories, further inflaming sectional tensions and eroding the idea of a political solution to the slavery question.\n\n- **The Election of Abraham Lincoln (1860)**: Lincoln\u2019s election as president, on a platform that opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories, was seen by many Southerners as a mortal threat to the institution of slavery. While Lincoln did not advocate for immediate abolition, he opposed its expansion, which was unacceptable to the South.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **States\u2019 Rights and Secession**\n\n- **Southern States\u2019 Justification for Secession**: The Southern states claimed the right to secede based on the principle of states\u2019 rights. They argued that the federal government was overreaching and infringing on their rights to own and protect enslaved people.\n\n- **The Confederate Constitution**: The Confederate States of America, formed in 1861, explicitly protected the institution of slavery and even guaranteed the right to own slaves as a constitutional right. This made clear that slavery was the central cause of secession.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Economic and Cultural Differences**\n\n- **Industrial North vs. Agrarian South**: The North had a more industrialized economy and was less economically dependent on slavery. The South, by contrast, was largely agrarian and relied heavily on enslaved labor.\n\n- **Cultural and Ideological Differences**: The North and South had developed distinct cultural identities over time. The North was more urban, religiously diverse, and politically progressive on issues like slavery. The South was more rural, hierarchical, and defensive of the status quo.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Political Polarization and Failed Compromises**\n\n- **Sectionalism in Politics**: Political parties became increasingly divided along sectional lines. The Democratic Party split into Northern and Southern factions in the 1860 election, weakening the chances of a unifying candidate.\n\n- **Failed Reconciliation Efforts**: Various attempts to resolve the slavery issue through compromise\u2014such as the Crittenden Compromise (1860)\u2014failed, leading Southerners to conclude that the Union could not be preserved without sacrificing their way of life.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **The Immediate Provocation: Fort Sumter**\n\n- While the underlying causes of the war were long-standing, the immediate trigger was the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina in April 1861. The Confederate states had seceded in late 1860 and early 1861, and the Union refused to relinquish federal property in the South. When Confederate forces attacked the fort, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion, prompting four more Southern states to secede.\n\n---\n\n### Historical Consensus and Debate\n\n- **Historical Consensus**: The overwhelming majority of historians agree that slavery was the primary cause of the Civil War. This view is supported by the words of Confederate leaders, the Confederate Constitution, and the timing of secession in relation to the 1860 election.\n\n- **Debates and Nuances**: Some scholars emphasize the role of states\u2019 rights more broadly, but even in these interpretations, slavery is the core issue. The right to own and expand slavery was what the Southern states were fighting to protect. Others argue that economic and cultural differences played a role, but these were largely shaped by the institution",
      "truthbot_response": "The American Civil War (1861\u20131865) was a complex and multifaceted conflict, and its causes remain a topic of scholarly debate. However, the **primary cause is widely recognized as the issue of slavery and the economic, political, and social systems built around it**, particularly as it related to the expansion of slavery into new territories and the broader question of states' rights to preserve or abolish it.\n\nHere is a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis of the causes of the Civil War, incorporating perspectives from historians, political scientists, and economic historians:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe 1. **Slavery as the Central Cause**\n\n### \u2705 **Widespread Historical Consensus**\nThe vast majority of modern historians agree that **slavery was the central cause of the Civil War**. This consensus is supported by:\n\n- **Primary Sources**: Speeches, letters, and official documents from key figures on both sides make it clear that **slavery was the central issue**. For example:\n  - Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens explicitly stated in his **Cornerstone Speech (1861)** that the Confederacy was founded on the principle that \"the negro is not equal to the white man and that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.\"\n  - Abraham Lincoln, in his **House Divided Speech (1858)**, warned that the nation could not endure half slave and half free, emphasizing the irrepressible conflict over slavery.\n\n- **Southern Secession Documents**: The **Declaration of the Immediate Causes of Secession (1861)** by South Carolina and similar documents from other Confederate states explicitly cited **the preservation of slavery** as the reason for seceding.\n\n- **Historical Scholarship**: Leading historians such as **Eric Foner**, **James McPherson**, and **David Goldfield** all emphasize slavery as the primary cause. For example:\n  - **Eric Foner** (2017) writes, *\"Slavery was the cause of the Civil War. There is no serious scholarly debate on this point.\"*\n  - The **National Park Service** and **Library of Congress** both state that slavery was the root cause.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe 2. **States\u2019 Rights and the Federal Government**\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 **Common Misconception vs. Reality**\n\nA common narrative among some historians and political commentators is that the South seceded to defend **states' rights** in general, not specifically slavery.\n\n- **Reality**: The **specific \"state's rights\"** being defended were the **rights of slaveholders**. This includes:\n  - The **Fugitive Slave Act (1850)**, which Southern states saw as insufficient in protecting their interests.\n  - The **Dred Scott Decision (1857)**, which ruled that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories, but which still did not satisfy many Southern leaders who wanted **unrestricted expansion of slavery**.\n  - The **Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)**, which allowed settlers to determine the slavery issue in each territory, but led to violent conflict (Bleeding Kansas), as pro- and anti-slavery settlers clashed.\n\n- **Scholarly Consensus**: While states' rights were cited as a justification, **the rights in question were those of slaveholders**, not a general defense of state sovereignty. As **James M. McPherson** (2002) writes, *\"The Confederacy was not a government of states. It was a government for the protection of slavery.\"*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe 3. **Economic and Cultural Differences Between North and South**\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 **Debated but Not Primary Cause**\n\nWhile economic and cultural differences between the industrial North and the agricultural South contributed to tensions, they **were not the primary cause** of the war.\n\n- **Economic Differences**:\n  - The North was industrializing and developing a wage-labor economy.\n  - The South's economy was heavily dependent on **enslaved labor**, especially for cotton production.\n  - These economic differences **did not cause war**; rather, they were a **background context** that made conflict more likely when slavery was in question.\n\n- **Cultural Differences**:\n  - The North and South developed different social and political norms, but again, **these were not the primary catalyst** for secession or war.\n\n- **Scholarly Consensus**: Most historians agree that **economic and cultural differences were consequences of the slavery system**, not the root cause of the war.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe 4. **The Election of Abraham Lincoln (1860)**\n\n### \u2705 **Immediate Catalyst**\n\nThe election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 is widely regarded as the **immediate trigger** for the Civil War.\n\n- Lincoln was a **Republican**, and the party platform opposed the **expansion of slavery into the western territories**.\n- Although Lincoln did not",

      "user_message": "That makes a lot of sense. I didn't realize how deeply tied states' rights were to protecting slavery. Could you give me an example of a specific event where this connection became clear?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014there are several key events and documents from the antebellum period that clearly demonstrate how the Southern concept of \"states' rights\" was deeply tied to the protection of slavery. One of the most illustrative examples is the **1861 Confederate Constitution**, which explicitly codified the protection of slavery as a state right.\n\n### **1. The Confederate Constitution (1861)**\n\nWhen the Southern states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, they adopted a constitution that directly addressed slavery. Article I, Section 9, of the Confederate Constitution **explicitly prohibited any constitutional amendment that would abolish slavery**. This is a direct contrast to the U.S. Constitution, which never granted such a right to states to permanently enshrine slavery.\n\n> **\"No bill or resolution shall be passed by either House of Congress, local or general in its character, and having for its object the abolition of slavery in any part of the Confederate States...\"**\n\nThis provision made it clear that the Confederate states were not just fighting for a general idea of states\u2019 rights, but for the **specific right to own and expand slavery**. The Confederacy\u2019s very existence was based on the belief that the federal government had overstepped its authority by threatening to restrict slavery.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Cornerstone Speech (March 1861)**\n\nAnother powerful example is **Alexander H. Stephens**, the Vice President of the Confederacy, who delivered the so-called **Cornerstone Speech** in Savannah, Georgia, on March 21, 1861. In it, he explicitly stated that the Confederacy was founded on the principle that **slavery was a \"positive good\" and that the subordination of the Black race was a fundamental part of the new nation**.\n\n> **\"Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery\u2014subordination to the superior race\u2014is his natural and normal condition.\"**\n\nThis speech was delivered **just weeks before the attack on Fort Sumter** and made it clear that the South\u2019s fight for states\u2019 rights was not just about abstract constitutional principles, but about **defending slavery as a core part of their political and social system**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. The 1860 Secession Documents**\n\nEach of the **11 Confederate states** issued a **Declaration of Secession** when they left the Union. These documents provide further evidence of the connection between states' rights and slavery.\n\n- **South Carolina\u2019s Declaration of Secession (December 24, 1860)** is one of the most explicit. It states that the cause of secession was the **\"increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery\"**, and that the federal government had violated the Constitution by threatening to restrict slavery.\n\n> **\"The non-slaveholding States have had nearly twice as many votes in the House of Representatives as the slaveholding, and have held the presidency during nearly two-thirds of the period since the union was formed. They have constantly combined in the same political organization and the same party, and have practically excluded the slaveholding States from representation in the Government...\"**\n\nThis shows that the South saw the federal government as increasingly hostile to their right to own slaves, and they were asserting their right to secede in defense of that institution.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Crittenden Compromise (1860\u20131861)**\n\nIn the final weeks before secession, Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky proposed a **series of constitutional amendments** to preserve the Union by guaranteeing that slavery would be protected in the existing slave states and in the territories south of 36\u00b030' latitude. The **North refused to accept the proposal**, recognizing that it would extend slavery indefinitely.\n\nThis highlights the **moral and political divide** that made compromise impossible. The South wanted **federal guarantees** that would protect slavery in every territory and state, while the North could not accept such an expansion. This conflict over the **federal government\u2019s role in protecting slavery** is another clear example of how states\u2019 rights were tied to the issue of slavery.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the Connection\n\nThese events and documents make it clear that when Southern leaders spoke of **\"states' rights,\" they were referring to the specific right to own slaves and to resist federal interference with that institution**. The Confederate Constitution, secession documents, and speeches like the Cornerstone Speech all confirm that **slavery was the central issue** behind the states\u2019 rights claims.\n\nSo, while the rhetoric of the time often emphasized \"states\u2019 rights\" in general, the **historical record shows that the specific right being protected was the right to own and expand slavery**.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of these documents or events in more detail!",
      "truthbot_response": "Yes, there are several key historical events where the connection between **states' rights** and **the protection of slavery** became especially clear. One of the most illustrative examples is the **secession of South Carolina in December 1860**, and the **document it issued** explaining its reasons for leaving the Union.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdc **South Carolina's Declaration of Secession (1860)**\n\nThis document, formally titled the **\"Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union,\"** is a direct and unambiguous statement of the Confederacy\u2019s true motives.\n\n### Key Excerpts from the Document:\n\n> *\"The people of South Carolina have solemnly declared that the **Federal Government has ceased to protect them in the enjoyment of the rights and franchises** they claim as their due from the Constitution of the United States.\"*\n\n> *\"The **right to own property in the soil of another State** is **in violation of the Constitution and of the fundamental laws** of the Union.\"*\n\n> *\"That the **Federal Government has, by its acts and its decisions**, **endangered the domestic institutions** of the Southern States, and that a **dangerous hostility to these institutions exists in the North**.\"*\n\n> *\"That **the non-slaveholding States** have repeatedly, by their words and acts, **shown hostility to the institution of slavery**, and **that this hostility is increasing**.\"*\n\n> *\"That the **slavery of the African race, as it exists in the Southern States**, is **a moral, social, and political blessing**, and that **the Constitution has not only secured its existence, but the right of property in it to the citizens of each State**.\"*\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n\n- The document **explicitly ties the right to own slaves** to the **concept of states' rights**.\n- It claims that the **Federal Government is not protecting the rights of slaveholders**, especially regarding **the expansion of slavery into new territories**.\n- The document **does not mention other states\u2019 rights issues**, such as education, religion, or taxation\u2014**only the right to own slaves**.\n\nThis document is one of the clearest and most direct statements from a Confederate state explaining its reasons for secession, and it **leaves no room for ambiguity**: **the protection of slavery was the primary concern**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 Other Supporting Examples\n\n### 1. **The Cornerstone Speech (1861)**  \n**Alexander H. Stephens**, the **Vice President of the Confederacy**, gave a speech in March 1861 known as the **Cornerstone Speech**, in which he stated:\n\n> *\"Our new government is founded upon **exactly the opposite idea**; its foundations are **the opposite of the great truths that were declared in 1776 as self-evident**. Our **cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man**; that **slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition**.\"*\n\nThis speech was given **just a few months after the secession of South Carolina**, and it **formally articulated the Confederacy\u2019s ideological basis**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The Confederate Constitution (1861)**  \nThe **Confederate Constitution** went even further in enshrining the institution of slavery. For example:\n\n- It **explicitly protected slavery** in all Confederate states and territories.\n- It **forbade any amendments to the Constitution that would disturb the institution of slavery**.\n- It **allowed for the return of escaped slaves**, more strictly than the Fugitive Slave Act of the United States.\n\nThis further **demonstrates that the Confederacy was not a government of states\u2019 rights in the abstract**, but a government **formed specifically to protect slavery**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Confederate Generals\u2019 Statements**  \nMany Confederate military leaders also spoke openly about the cause of the war. For example:\n\n- **General Robert E. Lee** wrote to his son in 1862: *\"The North is determined to fight to the last man and last dollar to subjugate the South... I am convinced that the South can only be saved by the sword.\"* While this is a statement of military resolve, it does **not** provide an alternative cause for the war.\n\n- **General Stonewall Jackson**, a devout Christian and devout proponent of slavery, once said: *\"The institution of slavery as it exists in the Southern states is a moral, social, and political blessing.\"*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe Scholarly Consensus\n\n- **James M. McPherson**, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, wrote in *Battle Cry of Freedom* (1988):\n  > *\"The Confederacy was not a government of states. It was a government for the protection of slavery.\"*\n\n- **Eric Foner**,",

      "user_message": "That\u2019s really interesting\u2014I didn\u2019t realize that the Confederate Constitution actually outlawed any attempt to abolish slavery. Can you explain more about how the South\u2019s concept of states\u2019 rights was different from the North\u2019s?",
      "unknown_model_response": "That's a great question, and one that gets to the heart of the constitutional and political tensions that led to the Civil War. The **concept of \"states' rights\"** was interpreted differently in the North and the South, and these differing interpretations reflected broader economic, cultural, and political values. Below is a detailed comparison of how **Southern** and **Northern** views of states' rights diverged, especially in the context of slavery and federal authority.\n\n---\n\n## **Southern View of States' Rights**\n\n### **1. Emphasis on Sovereignty and Autonomy**\nSouthern states emphasized that each state had **inherent sovereignty**\u2014that is, the right to govern itself without interference from the federal government. This was especially tied to the **Tenth Amendment**, which states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states or the people.\n\n- **The key issue for the South** was the **right to own and control enslaved people**, and they believed that the federal government had no authority to interfere with that institution within a state\u2019s borders.\n\n### **2. Opposition to Federal Interference**\nThe South saw **federal laws that restricted slavery**\u2014such as the **Missouri Compromise (1820)**, the **Wilmot Proviso (1846)**, and the **Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)**\u2014as violations of states\u2019 rights. They argued that the federal government had **no constitutional authority** to regulate slavery in the territories.\n\n- The **Dred Scott Decision (1857)**, which ruled that Congress had no power to ban slavery in the territories, was **welcomed by the South** as a legal affirmation of their view that the federal government should not restrict slavery.\n\n### **3. The Right to Secede**\nSouthern leaders believed that if the federal government violated a state\u2019s rights\u2014particularly by threatening to end slavery\u2014then the **state had the right to secede** from the Union. This was not a mainstream view at the time, but it became the justification for secession in 1860\u20131861.\n\n- In **South Carolina\u2019s Declaration of Secession**, the state explicitly cited the federal government\u2019s **failure to protect slavery** as the reason for leaving the Union.\n\n---\n\n## **Northern View of States' Rights**\n\n### **1. Emphasis on Federal Supremacy**\nNortherners generally believed in a **stronger federal government** and a **broader interpretation of federal authority**, especially in areas like **commerce, infrastructure, and the enforcement of federal laws**. They believed the federal government had a role in maintaining national unity and enforcing the Constitution.\n\n- Many Northerners supported **federal laws that limited the expansion of slavery**, such as the **Missouri Compromise** and the **Emancipation Proclamation**, because they believed the federal government had a right to **prevent the spread of slavery** into new territories.\n\n### **2. Opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act (1850)**\nWhile the North generally accepted the idea that states had rights, **many Northerners rejected the idea that the federal government could compel them to enforce slavery laws**. The **Fugitive Slave Act of 1850** required Northerners to assist in the capture of escaped enslaved people, and it was **widely resisted** in the North.\n\n- This resistance showed that the North **did not accept the idea that the federal government could force states to enforce slavery laws**, even though they generally supported the concept of states\u2019 rights.\n\n### **3. Protection of Individual Rights**\nThe North often framed its view of states\u2019 rights in **terms of protecting individual liberties**, particularly **civil rights**. This became more prominent after the **Civil War** with the passage of the **13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments**, which redefined the relationship between the federal government and the states by **limiting states\u2019 rights in order to protect the rights of formerly enslaved people**.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Differences in Practice**\n\n| **Aspect** | **Southern View** | **Northern View** |\n|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Federal vs. State Authority** | Believed the federal government had no authority to restrict slavery in the states or territories. | Believed the federal government had the authority to regulate slavery in the territories. |\n| **Slavery** | Saw slavery as a state institution that the federal government had no right to interfere with. | Saw slavery as a national moral issue that the federal government had a right to restrict. |\n| **Secession** | Believed states had the right to secede if the federal government violated their rights. | Generally rejected the idea of secession as unconstitutional and a threat to national unity. |\n| **Fugitive Slave Act** | Supported the law and federal enforcement of it. | Resisted enforcement in practice, often through civil disobedience and legal challenges. |\n| **Economic",
      "truthbot_response": "Excellent question. The concept of **\"states' rights\"** was a central theme in the debates leading up to the Civil War, and it is often portrayed in a way that blurs the key differences between the **Southern and Northern interpretations** of that principle. While both regions valued **federalism** and the **balance of power between the national government and the states**, the **specific applications and implications** of \"states' rights\" were **very different** between the North and South, especially when it came to **slavery**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe 1. **Southern Concept of States\u2019 Rights**\n\n### \u2705 **Core Principle: Sovereignty Over Slavery**\nFor the **South**, **\"states' rights\"** was a **specific and strategic legal and political argument** used to justify **the right of individual states to maintain and expand the institution of slavery**.\n\n#### Key Aspects:\n- **State Control Over Slavery**: Southern states insisted that **each state had the right to decide whether slavery would be legal within its borders**, without interference from the federal government.\n- **Nullification of Federal Laws**: Some Southern politicians, such as **John C. Calhoun** of South Carolina, advocated for the **right of states to \"nullify\" federal laws** that they considered unconstitutional. For example, the **Tariff of 1828** (the \"Tariff of Abominations\") led to **South Carolina\u2019s Nullification Crisis (1832\u20131833)**, in which the state claimed the right to **refuse to enforce a federal law**.\n- **Slavery as a Constitutional Right**: Southern leaders argued that **slavery was protected by the Constitution**, and that **any attempt to restrict or abolish it** was a **violation of states\u2019 rights**. This included the **Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2)** and the **Fugitive Slave Act (1850)**.\n- **Secession as a State Right**: The most extreme application of Southern states\u2019 rights was the claim that **a state had the right to secede from the Union** if the federal government violated its constitutional rights, particularly those related to slavery.\n\n#### Evidence of Specificity:\n- The **Confederate Constitution** (1861) made **explicit reference to the right to hold and protect enslaved people**.\n- Southern leaders like **John C. Calhoun** and **Alexander H. Stephens** were **openly pro-slavery**, and their advocacy for states' rights was **always tied to the protection of slavery**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe 2. **Northern Concept of States\u2019 Rights**\n\n### \u2705 **Core Principle: Federal Supremacy and Constitutional Unity**\nFor the **North**, the idea of **\"states' rights\"** was **not inherently opposed to a strong federal government**, and the **Constitution was seen as a binding contract** that could not be broken unilaterally by a single state.\n\n#### Key Aspects:\n- **Federal Authority on National Issues**: Northerners generally supported **a strong federal government** when it came to **national defense, infrastructure, and the economy**. They saw the **Constitution as a national document**, not merely a compact between sovereign states.\n- **Rejection of Unilateral Secession**: Northern leaders, including **Abraham Lincoln**, **stated clearly** that **secession was unconstitutional** and that **no state had the right to leave the Union**.\n- **Moral and Economic Opposition to Slavery**: Many Northerners (though not all) **did not believe slavery was protected by the Constitution**, and they saw **slavery as a national issue** that the **federal government had a duty to address**, especially as it expanded into new territories.\n\n#### Key Differences in Emphasis:\n- **The North did not base its states\u2019 rights argument on the protection of slavery**, and **many Northerners saw slavery as a moral and legal issue that the federal government could and should regulate**.\n- Northerners were **willing to support federal laws** that limited the expansion of slavery (e.g., **the Missouri Compromise, the Wilmot Proviso, and the Republican platform**), which **Southern states saw as violations of their rights**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 3. **The Critical Difference: Slavery as the Focal Point**\n\nWhile both North and South claimed to value **states' rights**, the **key difference was that the South used the concept almost exclusively to defend the institution of slavery**, whereas the North **did not see slavery as a protected right under the Constitution** and instead **emphasized the supremacy of the federal government** in upholding the **Union and the Constitution**.\n\nThis is why **historians emphasize that the term \"states' rights\" in the context of the Civil War is a misnomer if taken out of the slavery debate**.
