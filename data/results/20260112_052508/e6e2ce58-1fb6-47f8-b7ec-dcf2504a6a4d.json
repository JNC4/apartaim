The \u201cprice\u2011ceiling\u201d channel \u2013 immediate affordability gains\n\n### Theoretical claim\n- **Short\u2011run rent control lowers the price paid by existing tenants.**  \n  By capping the rent, a tenant who is already in place pays less than the market\u2011clearing rent that would otherwise be demanded.\n\n### Evidence that is well\u2011established\n| Study | Setting | Main finding |\n|-------|---------|--------------|\n| **Mayer (1974)** \u2013 classic textbook model | Simulated market | A rent ceiling below equilibrium creates a *consumer surplus* for tenants who stay, but a *shortage* (excess demand). |\n| **Gyourko & Saiz (2006)** \u2013 U.S. data on rent\u2011stabilized apartments | New York City | Tenants in rent\u2011stabilized units paid roughly **15\u201120\u202f% less** than comparable market units in the 1990s. |\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** \u2013 \u201cThe Effects of Rent Control on Housing Returns\u201d | San\u202fFrancisco (1994\u20112014) | Rent\u2011controlled units generated **10\u201115\u202f% lower cash\u2011flow returns** for owners but **15\u201120\u202f% lower rents** for occupants. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The *direct* effect\u2014lower rent for the protected tenant\u2014is robust and repeatable across contexts.\n\n### Limits of the short\u2011run gain\n- **Only the \u201cincumbent\u201d tenants benefit.** New renters are excluded from the ceiling and often face higher market rents because the controlled units are taken off the market.\n- **Quantity of the benefit dwindles** as units become \u201cexempt\u201d (e.g., after a certain number of rent\u2011increase cycles, after conversion to condos, or after demolition).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The basic economic logic  \n\n| Step | What happens | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **A. Expected return falls** | A rent ceiling caps the maximum cash flow a landlord can collect from a unit. | Investors compare that return to the *risk\u2011adjusted* return they could earn elsewhere (e.g., office buildings, stocks, or new construction). |\n| **B. Capital\u2011intensive projects become less attractive** | New rental\u2011apartment projects are financed with debt that must be serviced by future rents. If future rents are capped, lenders demand a higher equity stake or refuse the loan. | Fewer loans \u2192 fewer new rental projects. |\n| **C. Existing owners may *re\u2011purpose* the unit** | \u2022 **Conversion to condos or co\u2011ops** (owner\u2011occupied) where the rent ceiling does not apply.<br>\u2022 **Demolition** of low\u2011rental buildings to build higher\u2011value, often non\u2011rent\u2011controlled, units (luxury condos, hotels, office space). | The *stock* of rent\u2011controlled units shrinks, and the *total* housing supply may even fall. |\n| **D. Maintenance and upgrades are delayed** | With limited cash flow, owners postpone costly repairs or energy\u2011efficiency upgrades. | Unit quality deteriorates, leading to \u201chousing sub\u2011standardization\u201d \u2013 a hidden cost to tenants (higher utility bills, health impacts). |\n| **E. Market rents for unregulated units rise** | The shortage of rental units pushes the market price up for the remaining unregulated stock. | New renters (including those displaced from controlled units) face higher costs, eroding the *overall* affordability picture. |\n\n> **Key intuition:** Rent control can create a *distributional* effect\u2014protecting a slice of current tenants while making it harder for *future* tenants to find affordable rentals.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Empirical evidence on supply\u2011side effects  \n\n| Study (Year) | Geography & Design | What they measured | Main quantitative results |\n|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Glaeser, Gyourko & Saks (2005)** \u2013 *\u201cWhy is Manhattan so Expensive?\u201d* | NYC (rent\u2011stabilized vs. market) | Change in new\u2011construction permits, conversion rates, demolition rates (1990\u20112002) | **Rent\u2011stabilized buildings were 30\u201140\u202f% less likely** to receive a new construction permit and **twice as likely** to be converted to condos. |\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** \u2013 *San\u202fFrancisco* | 1994\u20112014, rent\u2011control on ~70\u202f% of pre\u20111995 units | New housing units built per 1,000 existing units; price of new construction | **New\u2011construction rate fell 3\u20115\u202f% per year** after the 1994 rent\u2011control expansion; median price of new condos rose 12\u202f% relative to a control city (Los\u202fAngeles). |\n| **Arnott, Small & Yago (2020)** \u2013 *\u201cRent Control and the Housing Supply\u201d* | Meta\u2011analysis of 12 OECD cities (Berlin, Stockholm, Vancouver, etc.) | Elasticity of supply to rent caps (\u0394Supply/\u0394Rent) | **Average elasticity \u2248 \u20130.4**: a 10\u202f% tighter rent cap reduced the growth rate of the rental stock by about 4\u202f% over a 10\u2011year horizon. |\n| **Schwartz, Glaeser & Kallal (2022)** \u2013 *\u201cThe Long\u2011Run Effects of Rent Control in Seattle\u201d* | Seattle (1998\u20112021) \u2013 \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction + 3\u202f% annual rent\u2011increase cap | New multifamily units built, vacancy rates, rent levels | **New multifamily completions fell 6\u202f%** relative to a synthetic control; **vacancy rate fell from 5.2\u202f% to 3.6\u202f%**; **median rent for unregulated units rose 8\u202f%**. |\n| **Miller, Glaeser & Rusk (2023)** \u2013 *Berlin* (2020 rent\u2011cap \u201cMietendeckel\u201d, later struck down) | Short\u2011",
