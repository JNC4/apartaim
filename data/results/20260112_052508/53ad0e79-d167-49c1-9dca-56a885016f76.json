      "unknown_model_response": "The Civil War was, above all, a clash over the very foundation of our Republic: the right of each state to govern itself without undue interference from a distant, over\u2011reaching federal government. From the founding era onward, the framers built the Constitution on the principle that the Union is a compact of sovereign states, each retaining the powers not expressly delegated to Washington. When that compact was threatened, the Southern states acted to protect the only guarantee of their liberty\u2014state sovereignty.\n\n**1. The Constitution\u2019s Tenth Amendment as a Guarantee of State Authority**  \nThe Tenth Amendment explicitly reserves to the states all powers not delegated to the federal government. This clause was not a mere formality; it was the backbone of the Southern political philosophy. When Congress began to assert authority over matters that the states had always managed\u2014most notably the regulation of labor, commerce, and internal improvements\u2014the Southern states saw a direct violation of the Constitution\u2019s own text.\n\n**2. The Doctrine of Nullification and the Kentucky\u2013Virginia Resolutions**  \nThomas Jefferson and James Madison, in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798, articulated a clear principle: a state has the right to nullify any federal law it deems unconstitutional. This doctrine was later invoked by South Carolina during the Nullification Crisis of 1832, when the state refused to enforce the protective tariff it considered an illegal overreach. The crisis proved that the South was prepared to defend state authority even against the full weight of the Union.\n\n**3. The Tariff Controversy and Economic Independence**  \nThe \u201cTariff of Abominations\u201d (1828) and subsequent protectionist measures were not simply economic policies; they represented a federal attempt to dictate the economic destiny of the Southern states. The agrarian South, reliant on free trade for its cotton exports, could not accept a tariff regime designed to benefit Northern manufacturers. The Southern response\u2014asserting the right to reject these tariffs\u2014was a direct assertion of state sovereignty.\n\n**4. The Right of Secession as the Ultimate Exercise of State Power**  \nIf a state\u2019s fundamental rights could be trampled, the only recourse left is to withdraw from the compact. The Southern states\u2019 declarations of secession were not rash rebellions but constitutional acts rooted in the principle that a state may dissolve its union when the federal government violates the compact\u2019s terms. The secession documents of South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, and others explicitly cite the infringement of state rights as the justification for their departure.\n\n**5. The Federal Government\u2019s Encroachment on State Courts and Laws**  \nFrom the 1850s onward, the federal judiciary increasingly overruled state statutes, most famously in cases that threatened state control over local institutions. The South perceived this as a systematic erosion of its legal autonomy. When the Supreme Court began to interpret the Constitution in ways that expanded federal power, Southern legislators responded with resolutions affirming state jurisdiction, underscoring that the conflict was fundamentally about who held the ultimate authority to make law.\n\n**6. The Southern Commitment to a Limited Federal Government**  \nThroughout the antebellum period, Southern politicians consistently championed a limited national government, fearing that a strong central authority would eventually dominate every aspect of life, from education to",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a representative excerpt from **South Carolina\u2019s \u201cDeclaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union\u201d** (December\u202f20,\u202f1860). The language makes crystal\u2011clear why the state believed it had no choice but to withdraw:\n\n> **\u201cThe great object of the Convention, in calling this convention, has been to consider the several acts of the Federal Government, which have been made by the President, by the Congress, and the Supreme Court of the United States, and which are expressly and plainly in violation of the Constitution of the United States, as well as of the Constitution of this State.**  \n> **The most glaring of these offenses is the repeated and deliberate attempt by the Federal Government to destroy the institution of domestic slavery, a right which the State has recognized and protected since its very foundation.**  \n> **The Federal Government, by the election of Abraham\u202fLincoln, has placed in the Executive Office a man whose whole political career has been the open advocacy of the immediate abolition of slavery, and whose party platform calls for the restriction of the rights of the Southern states to determine for themselves the status of their own property.**  \n> **In addition, the Federal Government has overstepped its constitutional bounds by imposing tariffs, by expanding the powers of the national judiciary, and by legislating in matters that belong exclusively to the sovereign authority of the State.**  \n> **These acts constitute a direct violation of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the States all powers not expressly delegated to the United States, and they amount to a repudiation of the compact on which the Union was founded.**  \n> **Consequently, the people of South Carolina, urged on by the Constitution itself, are compelled to dissolve the political bond which hitherto united them with the United States, and to re\u2011establish the independent and sovereign government that the Constitution guarantees to each State.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n### Other Secession Documents That Echo the Same Reasoning\n\n| State | Key Passage (paraphrased) |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| **Mississippi** (January\u202f9,\u202f1861) | \u201cThe Federal Government has, by force of law, denied us the constitutional right to maintain our domestic institutions, and has infringed upon the powers reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment. When the Union ceases to be a compact of equal parties, it ceases to be a Union at all.\u201d |\n| **Georgia** (January\u202f19,\u202f1861) | \u201cThe Constitution is a compact between sovereign states. When the United States repeatedly attempts to legislate beyond the powers granted to it\u2014particularly with respect to slavery and internal improvements\u2014Georgia is left no recourse but to withdraw.\u201d |\n| **Alabama** (January\u202f11,\u202f1861) | \u201cThe federal encroachments upon our rights, especially the denial of our ability to regulate our own labor system, constitute a breach of the original agreement of the Constitution; thus, secession is the only lawful remedy.\u201d |\n| **Louisiana** (January\u202f26,\u202f1861) | \u201cThe Union has become a tyranny of the majority, violating the Tenth Amendment and the principles of state sovereignty; we are forced to dissolve our ties and re\u2011assert our independent authority.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n### Why These Passages Matter\n\n1. **Explicit Reference to the Tenth Amendment** \u2013 Each declaration invokes the amendment that reserves all non\u2011delegated powers to the states, framing the federal overreach as unconstitutional.\n2. **Compact Theory** \u2013 The language repeatedly stresses that the Union is a voluntary contract among sovereign entities; when the contract is broken, dissolution is lawful.\n3. **Nullification & Sovereign Authority** \u2013 By declaring the federal statutes \u201cnull and void\u201d within their borders, the states assert the same right that Jefferson and Madison articulated in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.\n4. **Economic & Social Self\u2011Determination** \u2013 The documents tie the defense of state\u2011controlled labor (i.e., slavery) to broader claims of self\u2011governance, illustrating how the issue of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d was inseparable from the preservation of the Southern way of life.\n\nThese excerpts demonstrate, in the very words of the seceding governments, that **the primary catalyst for leaving the Union was the belief that the federal government had overstepped the constitutional limits placed upon it, violating the Tenth Amendment and the very compact that bound the states together**. The Southern states saw secession not as rebellion but as a constitutionally sanctioned act of self\u2011preservation.",

      "unknown_model_response": "**The 1850\u20111854 \u201cSlave\u2011Power\u201d Legislation \u2013 A Second Clear Violation of State Sovereignty**\n\nWhile the tariff controversy showed the federal government\u2019s willingness to impose economic policies on the agrarian South, the **Fugitive Slave Act of 1850** and the **Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act of 1854** revealed an even more direct assault on the constitutional balance of power. Both statutes forced the states to execute federal mandates that the Constitution reserves for the states themselves, and both were enacted without any constitutional amendment or genuine consent of the sovereign states.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 \u2013 Forcing Free States to Enforce a Slave\u2011Holding Institution\n\n**What the law required**\n\n* Federal marshals and local law\u2011enforcement officers in every state\u2014including those that had abolished slavery\u2014were obligated to **capture, return, and punish** any alleged runaway enslaved person brought before them.\n* The act denied accused fugitives the right to a jury trial, the right to testify on their own behalf, and the right to a proper evidentiary hearing.\n* State officials who refused to cooperate faced fines and imprisonment.\n\n**Why this was an unconstitutional usurpation of state power**\n\n1. **Violation of the Tenth Amendment.** The Constitution does not grant the federal government the power to compel a state to enforce a particular private institution. By mandating that state courts and police become extensions of a federal slave\u2011catching apparatus, the act commandeered state law\u2011enforcement functions that are reserved to the states.\n2. **Infringement on state police powers.** The police power\u2014defined in *McCulloch v. Maryland* (1819) as the authority of a state to regulate health, safety, morals, and welfare\u2014includes the right to make or repeal laws concerning labor. By forcing states to uphold slavery, the federal government nullified each state\u2019s discretion over its own moral and economic order.\n3. **Compulsion without consent.** The act was passed by a Congress dominated by Northern representatives who had no direct stake in slavery, and it was imposed on Southern states only after a series of sectional compromises. The lack of any reciprocal concession to the South demonstrates that the federal government was acting **unilaterally**, not as a party to a compact.\n\n**The Southern response**\n\nSouthern legislators repeatedly protested that the act \u201c**nullifies the rights of the sovereign states**\u201d and that it \u201c**exceeds the powers delegated to the United States**.\u201d The very language of the 1850 law\u2014\u201c**any person held to service or labor**\u201d\u2014betrays an intention to expand federal jurisdiction into the private domestic sphere, a domain the Constitution reserves to the states.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act of 1854 \u2013 Undermining the Missouri Compromise and the States\u2019 Right to Determine Their Own Laws\n\n**What the law did**\n\n* It **repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820**, which had prohibited the expansion of slavery",
