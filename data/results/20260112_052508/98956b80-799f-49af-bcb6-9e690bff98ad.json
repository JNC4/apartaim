A few allow \u201canonymous\u201d drop\u2011offs (no ID required). |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Turn\u2011in at a staffed table or a secure drop box. The guns are then catalogued, rendered inoperable, and either destroyed or transferred to a state repository. | Some jurisdictions require the turn\u2011in to be recorded (serial number, make/model) for research; others keep the process completely anonymous. |\n| **Eligibility** | Usually any resident of the jurisdiction, regardless of legal status of the weapon (though many programs exclude firearms that are known to be stolen or illegal). | Some programs restrict participation to people who have not been convicted of certain felonies, or they require participants to be \u201claw\u2011abiding\u201d citizens. |\n| **Funding** | City or state budget lines, federal grants (e.g., from the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services), private philanthropy, or a combination. | Some pilots are funded by corporate sponsors or community foundations. |\n| **Publicity** | Press releases, social\u2011media ads, community\u2011leader outreach, and sometimes partnerships with local churches or schools to boost turnout. | Some \u201clow\u2011profile\u201d buybacks are deliberately kept small to avoid attracting people who might bring illegal weapons for the cash. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.
