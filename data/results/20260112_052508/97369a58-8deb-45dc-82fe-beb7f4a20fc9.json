      "unknown_model_response": "**Red meat and cancer \u2013 what the evidence actually says**\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the current scientific picture.  It is organized around three questions that most readers find useful:\n\n| Question | Key take\u2011away | What the research shows (selected high\u2011impact sources) |\n|----------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Is red meat classified as a carcinogen?** | *\u201cProbable\u201d* carcinogen for **processed** meat; *\u201climited\u201d* evidence for **unprocessed** red meat. | \u2022 **IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) 2015** \u2013 Processed meat (e.g., bacon, sausage, ham) \u2192 *Group\u202f1* (carcinogenic to humans). Unprocessed red meat (beef, pork, lamb, goat) \u2192 *Group\u202f2A* (probably carcinogenic).<br>\u2022 **WHO/FAO** reaffirmed this classification in a 2021 technical update, noting that the evidence for unprocessed meat remains \u201climited but suggestive.\u201d |\n| **2. Which cancers are most strongly linked to meat intake?** | **Colorectal cancer** has the most consistent association; modest or inconsistent links for pancreatic, prostate, breast, and other sites. | \u2022 **Colorectal cancer** \u2013 2020 meta\u2011analysis of >\u202f30 prospective cohorts (Aune\u202fet\u202fal., *Int\u202fJ\u202fCancer*) reported a pooled relative risk (RR) of **1.12 per 100\u202fg/day** of unprocessed red meat and **1.18 per 50\u202fg/day** of processed meat.<br>\u2022 **Pancreatic cancer** \u2013 2022 pooled analysis (Pan\u202fet\u202fal., *Gastroenterology*) found a small but statistically significant RR \u2248\u202f1.07 per 100\u202fg/day of processed meat; evidence for unprocessed meat was weaker (RR\u202f\u2248\u202f1.03, not significant).<br>\u2022 **Prostate cancer** \u2013 2021 systematic review (Zhou\u202fet\u202fal., *Cancer Epidemiol*) showed a borderline increase (RR\u202f\u2248\u202f1.06) only for high\u2011intake (>\u202f200\u202fg/day) of processed meat; unprocessed red meat showed no clear trend.<br>\u2022 **Breast, ovarian, endometrial** \u2013 Large consortium studies (e.g., EPIC, NHS/HPFS) have not found reproducible dose\u2011response relationships after adjusting for total energy, BMI, and other dietary factors. |\n| **3. How strong is the evidence?** | Observational (cohort & case\u2011control) studies dominate; randomized trials are scarce; confounding and measurement error are major limitations. | \u2022 **GRADE assessment** (used by WHO) rates the evidence for processed meat\u2013colorectal cancer as **moderate** certainty (observational, but consistent, dose\u2011responsive, biologically plausible).<br>\u2022 For unprocessed red meat, certainty is **low\u2013moderate** because (a) effect sizes are small, (b) many studies show heterogeneity, and (c) residual confounding (e.g., lifestyle, other dietary factors) cannot be ruled out.<br>\u2022 No large, long\u2011term randomized controlled trial (RCT) has directly tested meat reduction vs. cancer incidence; the **PREDIMED\u2011Spain** trial (Mediterranean diet with reduced red meat) reported a non\u2011significant trend toward lower cancer incidence, but the trial was not powered for cancer outcomes. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.
