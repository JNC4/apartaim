The basic logic of sanctions  \n\n| Step in the \u201csanctions chain\u201d | What the sanctioner does | Intended effect on the target | How the effect is supposed to translate into a policy change |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Threat/Imposition** | Restrict trade, finance, travel, or investment (e.g., an export ban on oil, a freeze on sovereign assets, a ban on airline access). | Reduce the target\u2019s *economic* resources (revenues, imports of key inputs, access to foreign finance) and raise the *political* cost of a given behavior. | The target\u2019s leadership feels the cost outweighs the benefit of the objectionable behavior and therefore changes that behavior (e.g., stops nuclear proliferation, ends a military invasion, improves human\u2011rights practices). |\n| **2. Signal** | Publicly announce the purpose of the measures, the conditions for removal, and the credibility of enforcement. | Creates *information* and *reputational* pressure: the target knows the sanctioner is serious and that the international community is watching. | Signals that non\u2011compliance will be costly; if the target cares about its image or about future trade/aid, it may acquiesce. |\n| **3. Leverage** | Use the target\u2019s economic interdependence (e.g., reliance on oil exports, access to the global banking system) as a bargaining chip. | Makes the cost *asymmetric*: the sanctioner can bear the loss (or spread it across many partners), while the target bears a disproportionate burden. | The target\u2019s leadership may have to choose between continuing the undesired policy and risking economic collapse or political instability. |\n| **4. Compulsion or Incentive** | Often paired with a *carrot*: a clear roadmap for lifting sanctions if the target complies. | Provides a *positive* motive to change, not just a punitive one. | The target can calculate a \u201cwin\u2011win\u201d \u2013 compliance brings relief; non\u2011compliance prolongs hardship. |\n\n*In theory* the chain works when three conditions are met:\n\n1. **Sufficient pressure** \u2013 the economic loss must be large enough to matter to the decision\u2011makers.\n2. **Credible threat of escalation** \u2013 the target must believe the sanctioner will follow through (or that other states will join).\n3. **Clear, attainable objectives** \u2013 the target must understand *what* it has to do to have the sanctions lifted.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the scholarly literature finds  \n\n### 2.1  Meta\u2011analyses (the \u201cbig picture\u201d)\n\n| Study | Sample & Method | Overall success rate (policy change) | Key qualifiers |\n|-------|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007) \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*** | 221 cases (1970\u20112005), logistic regression controlling for target attributes, sanction type, and coalition size. | **\u2248 34\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their stated objectives. | Multilateral sanctions were roughly twice as likely to succeed as unilateral ones; \u201csmart\u201d (targeted) sanctions had higher success than comprehensive trade bans. |\n| **Drezner (2011) \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox*** | Re\u2011analysis of 100+ cases, focusing on *coercive*",
