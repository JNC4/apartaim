      "user_message": "What are the long\u2011term impacts of rent control policies on housing affordability?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn the short run, rent\u2011control (RC) can keep the unit\u2011level rent that existing tenants pay below market levels, which makes those households more affordable. In the long run, however, the weight of the empirical evidence is that conventional, \u201cprice\u2011cap\u201d rent\u2011control tends to **reduce the overall stock of affordable housing** by discouraging new construction, encouraging conversion of rental units to other uses, and degrading the quality of the housing that remains.  The magnitude of those effects depends heavily on the *design* of the policy (e.g., how tight the caps are, whether new construction is exempt, whether vacancy de\u2011control is allowed, and whether \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction protections are attached).  Where policies are carefully calibrated\u2014e.g., modest caps that apply only to existing units, with strong vacancy de\u2011control and incentives for new construction\u2014the negative supply effects can be muted, but the net impact on city\u2011wide affordability is still mixed.\n\nBelow is a structured synthesis of the most robust findings, the main points of contention, and the nuances that shape outcomes in different contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How economists define \u201crent control\u201d\n\n| Term | Typical legal/administrative meaning | Typical economic effect |\n|------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Strict rent control** (price ceiling) | Rents for *all* units are capped at a fixed level (often a percentage of a base year rent) and *vacancy de\u2011control* is prohibited; landlords may raise rents only by a small, legislated amount each year. | Strong upward pressure on excess demand \u2192 long\u2011run supply contraction. |\n| **Rent stabilization** (moderate caps) | Rents can rise each year but only by a formula tied to inflation, operating costs, or a \u201cmaximum allowable rent\u201d (MAR). New units are often exempt; vacancy de\u2011control allows landlords to reset to market rent when a tenant moves out. | Smaller distortions; still reduces incentives to add units, but less severe than strict caps. |\n| **Hybrid designs** | Mix of the above (e.g., \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction protections, \u201chard\u201d vs \u201csoft\u201d de\u2011control, exemption for new construction, \u201cinclusionary\u201d caps for a share of units). | Outcomes vary widely; the design details matter more than the label. |\n\nThe academic literature almost always distinguishes *price\u2011cap* regimes (the classic \u201crent control\u201d of the 1940\u201170s) from *rent\u2011stabilization* regimes that permit periodic rent adjustments and vacancy turnover at market rates.  The former is where the strongest negative supply effects have been documented; the latter produces more ambiguous results.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The city\u2019s experience is documented in several peer\u2011reviewed studies and in the city\u2019s own housing\u2011policy reports, giving us a fairly complete picture of the supply\u2011side and affordability outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  The policy that was adopted  \n\n| Design element | How it was written in San\u202fFrancisco (1994) | Why it matters |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Scope** | All rental units built **before\u202f1\u202fJan\u202f1995** (\u2248\u202f45\u202f% of the city\u2019s rental stock at the time) were placed under a **price\u2011cap** that limited annual rent increases to the **Consumer Price Index (CPI) \u2013 2\u202f%** (the \u201crent\u2011freeze\u201d rule). | A very large share of the market was frozen, far beyond the \u201csmall\u2011stock\u201d approach used in NYC. |\n| **Vacancy de\u2011control** | **Prohibited.** When a tenant vacated, the landlord could raise the rent **only by the same CPI\u20112\u202f% formula** (i.e., the unit never reset to market rent). | Landlords could not recover any \u201clost rent\u201d from a previous tenant, making each unit a long\u2011run loss\u2011making asset unless they could raise the rent through a \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction or an illegal \u201ccash\u2011for\u2011keys\u201d deal. |\n| **Exemption for new construction** | **None.** New multifamily buildings (even those built after 1995) were automatically covered if they were **rent\u2011regulated** (i.e., if the owner chose to rent them at the regulated rate). In practice, many developers elected the regulated option to qualify for low\u2011interest city loans, thereby extending the rent\u2011control ceiling to brand\u2011new units. | The price ceiling applied to *both* the existing stock and virtually all new supply, eroding the profit motive for building additional rental housing. |\n| **Just\u2011cause eviction** | **Absent** until 2015 (when a limited \u201ctenant protection\u201d ordinance was passed). Prior to that, landlords could evict for any \u201creasonable\u201d cause, often using \u201cnon\u2011payment\u201d or \u201cowner move\u2011in\u201d loopholes. | Allowed landlords to \u201cturn over\u201d units quickly, but because the rent stayed capped, the incentive was to **convert** the unit to a higher\u2011value use (condo, office, short\u2011term rental) rather than keep it as a regulated rental. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
