Selection of Test Materials** | \u2022 **GM test diet** \u2013 the grain or processed food that carries the introduced gene(s). <br>\u2022 **Isogenic control diet** \u2013 the same variety that has not been genetically altered, grown under identical agronomic conditions. <br>\u2022 **Reference diet** \u2013 a well\u2011characterised, non\u2011GM commercial feed that serves as a benchmark for normal growth. | Using an isogenic control isolates the effect of the genetic insertion itself, eliminating confounding factors such as soil, climate, or pesticide regimes. |\n| **2. Dose Levels** | \u2022 **Low dose** \u2013 reflects realistic human consumption (\u2248 5\u202f% of the diet). <br>\u2022 **Mid dose** \u2013 a moderate increase (\u2248 15\u202f%). <br>\u2022 **High dose** \u2013 a \u201cworst\u2011case\u201d exposure (\u2248 30\u201350\u202f% of the diet). | If adverse effects appear only at the high dose, regulators can still question the safety margin because humans may inadvertently consume higher levels through processed foods, animal feed, or accidental contamination. |\n| **3. Test Population** | \u2022 **Species** \u2013 Sprague\u2011Dawley rats (both sexes) are the gold standard because of their well\u2011mapped physiology. <br>\u2022 **Numbers** \u2013 10\u201320 animals per sex per dose group, providing statistical power to detect even modest changes. | Rats share many metabolic pathways with humans, and using both sexes captures any sex\u2011specific toxicity. |\n| **4. Duration** | **90 days** of continuous feeding, covering the majority of the animal\u2019s growth cycle. Some studies extend to **180 days** (sub\u2011chronic) or even **two\u2011generation** protocols. | Chronic exposure mimics the lifelong consumption pattern of humans. |\n| **5. End\u2011Point Measurements** | 1. **Clinical Observations** \u2013 body weight, food intake, behavior, mortality. <br>2. **Hematology & Clinical Chemistry** \u2013 liver enzymes (ALT, AST), kidney markers (creatinine, BUN), glucose, cholesterol, electrolytes. <br>3. **Organ Weights** \u2013 liver, kidneys, heart, spleen, brain, reproductive organs. <br>4. **Histopathology** \u2013 microscopic examination of every major organ for cellular lesions, inflammation, necrosis, or neoplastic changes. <br>5. **Reproductive & Developmental Metrics** \u2013 sperm count, estrous cycle regularity, fetal weight (if a two\u2011generation study). <br>6. **Gut Microbiome Analysis** \u2013 16S rRNA sequencing to detect dysbiosis. <br>7. **Molecular Biomarkers** \u2013 expression of stress\u2011response genes (e.g., Hsp70, p53), oxidative\u2011damage markers (8\u2011OH\u2011dG), and immune\u2011modulating cytokines. | A comprehensive panel ensures that any subtle or overt toxicity is captured, not just overt mortality. |\n| **6.
