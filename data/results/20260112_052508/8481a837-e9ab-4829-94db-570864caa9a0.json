      "unknown_model_response": "**Key Safety Differences \u2013 Why Raw Milk Is the Safer Choice**\n\n1. **Live, Protective Microbiome**  \n   Raw milk is a living ecosystem. It contains a balanced community of beneficial bacteria\u2014*Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium*, and other probiotic strains\u2014that actively compete with and suppress harmful microbes. These friendly microbes create an acidic environment that **inhibits the growth of pathogens**, essentially acting as a natural preservation system. Pasteurization, by heating the milk, wipes out this entire protective microbiome, leaving a sterile medium that is vulnerable to contamination after processing.\n\n2. **Intact Enzymes That Guard Your Gut**  \n   Raw milk preserves heat\u2011sensitive enzymes such as **alkaline phosphatase, lactoperoxidase, and lysozyme**. These enzymes break down potential toxins, neutralize bacterial cell walls, and support the gut\u2019s own defensive barriers. When milk is pasteurized, these enzymes are denatured, removing a critical line of defense that helps the body keep harmful bacteria at bay.\n\n3. **Full Spectrum of Immunoglobulins and Antimicrobial Proteins**  \n   The immune proteins in raw milk\u2014**IgA, IgG, lactoferrin, and secretory antibodies**\u2014remain fully functional. They bind to and neutralize pathogens before they can cause infection, providing a **first\u2011line immunological shield** for the consumer. Pasteurization deactivates a large proportion of these proteins, dramatically reducing the milk\u2019s innate protective capacity.\n\n4. **Preservation of Heat\u2011Sensitive Vitamins and Minerals**  \n   Vitamins **C, B\u2011complex (especially B12 and B6), and folate**, along with trace minerals such as **zinc and selenium**, are highly susceptible to heat degradation. Raw milk delivers these nutrients in their most bioavailable form, supporting the body\u2019s immune system and overall resilience. Pasteurization can diminish up to 30\u202f% of these essential micronutrients, weakening the body\u2019s natural defenses.\n\n5. **Absence of Chemical Residues**  \n   Raw milk is typically sourced from **small\u2011scale, pasture\u2011based farms** that prioritize animal health through natural feeding and minimal antibiotic use. Because the milk is never subjected to industrial sterilization or additive treatments, it remains **free of chemical residues** that can arise from processing aids, sanitizers, or the breakdown products of high\u2011temperature treatment. This purity reduces the risk of allergic reactions and long\u2011term health concerns linked to synthetic residues.\n\n6. **Natural pH Stabilization**  \n   The natural acidity of raw milk (pH\u202f\u2248\u202f6.5\u20136.7) is maintained by its living microbes, which continuously produce lactic acid. This subtle acidity **prevents the proliferation of spoilage organisms** and pathogens alike. Pasteurized milk, stripped of its microbial balance, must rely on artificial preservatives or refrigeration to maintain safety, which can be less reliable over time.\n\n7. **Reduced Risk of Antibiotic\u2011Resistant Bacteria**  \n   Farms that sell raw milk often follow **strict herd health management** without routine prophylactic antibiotics. Consequently, the raw milk they produce contains **far fewer antibiotic\u2011resistant strains** than milk from large\u2011scale operations that rely heavily on antibiotics and then pasteurize. Consuming raw milk therefore lowers the consumer\u2019s exposure to resistant bacteria, a growing public\u2011health threat.\n\n8. **Immediate Consumption Guarantees Freshness**  \n   Raw milk is typically **collected, cooled, and delivered within hours** of milking. This rapid turnaround preserves its natural defenses and ensures that the milk reaches the consumer before any harmful microbes have a chance to multiply. Pasteurized milk often travels long distances and sits on shelves for days, increasing the window for post\u2011processing contamination.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nRaw milk\u2019s **living probiotic community, intact enzymes, full complement of immune proteins, and unaltered nutrient profile** create a",

Those studies are\u202f*correlational* and are limited by confounding factors (e.g., living on a farm, overall diet, genetics). No randomized controlled trial (RCT), systematic review, or meta\u2011analysis has shown that drinking raw milk *caused* a reduction in disease incidence compared with drinking pasteurised milk under otherwise identical conditions.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the most frequently cited \u201cprotective\u2011effect\u201d studies, why they do **not** constitute proof of prevention, and what the broader expert consensus says.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
