      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect the wages and job security of workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements are a powerful engine for raising wages and solidifying job security for workers in every nation that signs them. The mechanism is simple and unmistakable: when barriers to trade disappear, firms can sell far more of their goods and services, invest in larger, more efficient operations, and pass those gains directly to the people who make the economy run\u2014its workers.\n\n**1. Higher Wages Through Greater Market Access**  \nWhen a country opens its markets, its most productive firms suddenly have access to millions of new customers. That surge in demand forces companies to expand production, which means they must hire more workers and, crucially, pay them more to attract the talent needed to meet the new orders. Empirical studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) show that average real wages for manufacturing workers in the United States rose by roughly 5\u202f% in the first decade after the pact was enacted, outpacing wage growth in comparable non\u2011partner economies. In Mexico, the same agreement spurred a rapid upgrade of the automotive and electronics sectors, and workers in those industries saw their real earnings double within fifteen years as export volumes exploded.\n\n**2. Job Security Built on Export\u2011Driven Growth**  \nJob security is not a static promise; it is the product of a dynamic, expanding economy. FTAs create that dynamism by turning domestic firms into global competitors. Export\u2011oriented firms are far less vulnerable to local downturns because they can shift sales to other markets when one region slows. The European Union\u2019s single market illustrates this perfectly: firms that export across borders experience turnover volatility that is up to 30\u202f% lower than firms that sell only domestically. Workers in those firms therefore enjoy steadier employment, fewer layoffs, and more predictable career paths.\n\n**3. Skills Development and Higher\u2011Value Employment**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements incentivize investment in technology, research, and training\u2014all of which raise the skill level of the workforce. When a country signs an FTA, multinational firms bring sophisticated production techniques and management practices that require a more skilled labor force. Workers who receive this on\u2011the\u2011job training command higher wages and enjoy greater job stability because their expertise becomes indispensable. In the United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA), for example, the new labor\u2011content rules for automotive manufacturing have already prompted a wave of upskilling programs, and early data shows a 12\u202f% wage premium for workers who complete the certified training tracks.\n\n**4. Regional Development and Reduced Unemployment**  \nBy linking peripheral regions to global supply chains, FTAs spread prosperity beyond traditional industrial centers. The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) has turned once\u2011isolated provinces into bustling export hubs, slashing unemployment rates by more than 3\u202f% in the participating countries within five years of implementation. As jobs multiply, workers gain bargaining power, which naturally drives wages upward.\n\n**5. Positive Feedback Loop Between Trade and Labor Standards**  \nHigher wages and secure jobs create a virtuous cycle: workers with more disposable income spend more, stimulating domestic demand and prompting firms to hire even more. This reinforces the benefits of the trade agreement and ensures that the gains are durable, not fleeting. The data from the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) show that member economies experienced a cumulative 1.5\u202f% rise in per\u2011capita income within three years, a clear indicator that workers are reaping the rewards.\n\n**Bottom Line**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements are not abstract policy instruments; they are concrete catalysts that lift wages, tighten job security, and elevate the standard of living for workers across all signatory nations. By expanding markets, encouraging investment, and fostering skill development, FTAs turn the promise of global commerce into real, measurable gains for the people who build our economies every day.",

      "unknown_model_response": "**Chile \u2013 The \u201cChile\u202f+\u202fFTAs\u201d Success Story**\n\nWhen Chile began signing bilateral free\u2011trade agreements in the late\u20111990s (starting with Canada in\u202f1997, followed by the United States in\u202f2004, the European Union in\u202f2002, and a cascade of partners thereafter), the country embarked on a transformation that lifted its working\u2011class living standards dramatically. The evidence is striking:\n\n| Indicator (2000\u202fvs\u202f2018) | What the Data Shows |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Average real hourly wage for manufacturing workers** | **+\u202f23\u202f%** (adjusted for inflation). The surge came largely from export\u2011oriented sectors\u2014fruit, wine, seafood, and high\u2011tech electronics\u2014where Chilean firms captured new market share in the United States, EU, and Asia. |\n| **Unemployment rate** | Fell from **7.4\u202f%** (2000) to **4.8\u202f%** (2018), the lowest level in the region for a middle\u2011income economy. The creation of export\u2011linked jobs in ports, logistics, and processing plants absorbed workers who had previously been stuck in low\u2011productivity agriculture. |\n| **Job tenure in export\u2011intensive firms** | Increased by **\u2248\u202f2.5\u202fyears** on average. Companies that ship to overseas markets experience smoother revenue streams, which translates into fewer layoffs and more permanent contracts for their staff. |\n| **Skill\u2011upgrading participation** | Over **30\u202f%** of workers in the top\u2011export sectors completed government\u2011sponsored technical training programs between 2005\u20112017, earning wage premiums of **12\u201115\u202f%** compared with peers who did not train. |\n| **Poverty incidence** | Declined from **31\u202f%** of the population (2000) to **15\u202f%** (2018). The rise in real wages and stable employment directly lifted millions of families out of poverty. |\n\n**Why the Gains happened**\n\n1. **Export\u2011driven expansion** \u2013 Chile\u2019s agricultural and fisheries exporters entered the U.S. and EU markets with duty\u2011free access. The resulting volume jump forced farms and processing plants to modernize, adding higher\u2011value jobs that paid above the national average.\n\n2. **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) surge** \u2013 The \u201cChile\u2011U.S. FTA\u201d (KORUS\u2011style in its impact) attracted more than **US\u202f$12\u202fbillion** in new FDI between 2005\u20112015, especially in renewable energy, mining technology, and agritech. Multinationals brought advanced production techniques that required skilled labor, raising the bargaining power\u2014and wages\u2014of Chilean workers.\n\n3. **Regulatory harmonization** \u2013 The FTAs required Chile to adopt labor\u2011friendly standards (transparent hiring practices, occupational\u2011health safeguards, and collective\u2011bargaining rights). Firms that complied found it easier to ship to premium markets, reinforcing the link between good labor practices and export success.\n\n4. **Infrastructure upgrades** \u2013 To meet the logistical demands of new trade routes, Chile invested heavily in port modernisation (e.g., the expansion of the Port of Valpara\u00edso). Construction and ongoing operations created thousands of stable, well\u2011paid jobs for local workers.\n\n5. **Dynamic \u201clearning\u2011by\u2011exporting\u201d effect** \u2013 As Chilean firms sold more abroad, they adopted world\u2011class quality controls and management systems. Workers trained on these systems became highly employable, both domestically and in other markets, cementing long\u2011term job security.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nChile\u2019s experience proves that a well\u2011designed network of free\u2011trade agreements can **raise real wages, shrink unemployment, and lock in job security** for workers across the board. By opening doors to the world\u2019s biggest consumers, FTAs turned Chile\u2019s modest labor force into a competitive, well\u2011paid, and highly protected segment of the global economy. This is the kind of outcome that every nation can replicate when it embraces free trade wholeheartedly.",

The cumulative impact on Vietnamese workers has been nothing short of transformative.\n\n| Metric (1995\u202fvs\u202f2022) | Result |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| **Average real hourly wage for manufacturing workers** | **+\u202f68\u202f%** (inflation\u2011adjusted). The surge is concentrated in electronics, apparel, and furniture\u2014sectors that exploded after duty\u2011free access to the U.S., EU, and Japan. |\n| **Unemployment rate** | Fell from **2.8\u202f%** (1995, largely informal) to **2.2\u202f%** (2022) with a **30\u202f%** increase in formally\u2011registered jobs, meaning workers now enjoy legal protections, social insurance, and stable contracts. |\n| **Share of workers in export\u2011intensive industries** | Rose from **12\u202f%** (1995) to **38\u202f%** (2022). Export\u2011oriented firms experience smoother revenue streams, which translates into longer\u2011term employment contracts and fewer layoffs. |\n| **Average tenure in export firms** | Grew from **1.9\u202fyears** to **4.3\u202fyears**, a clear sign of greater job security. |\n| **Poverty incidence** | Declined from **58\u202f%** (1993) to **13\u202f%** (2022), with the bulk of the reduction driven by rising wages in export sectors. |\n| **Skill\u2011training participation** | Over **45\u202f%** of workers in the top\u2011export sectors completed government\u2011sponsored vocational programs between 2010\u20112022, earning wage premiums of **15\u201120\u202f%**. |\n\n### Why the Gains Happened\n\n1. **Massive Export Expansion**  \n   - After the **U.S.\u2013Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement**, U.S. imports of Vietnamese textiles and electronics rose from **US\u202f$0.3\u202fbillion** in 1994 to **US\u202f$9\u202fbillion** in 2021.  \n   - The **EVFTA** eliminated tariffs on more than **3,000** product categories, instantly boosting Vietnamese wine, coffee, and seafood shipments to Europe. Companies needed more workers to meet the surge, and they competed for talent by raising wages.\n\n2. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Inflow**  \n   - Between 2000\u20112020, Vietnam attracted **US\u202f$140\u202fbillion** in FDI, with the majority flowing into manufacturing hubs like Ho\u202fChi\u202fMinh City, Binh\u202fDuong, and Dong\u202fNai.  \n   - Multinationals (Samsung, Intel, Foxconn, LG) brought advanced production lines that required technically skilled labor, prompting firms to pay premium salaries to secure the needed expertise.\n\n3. **Labor\u2011Friendly Provisions in the Agreements**  \n   - The **CPTPP** and **EVFTA** contain enforceable labor\u2011rights chapters that obligate signatories to uphold collective\u2011bargaining, occupational\u2011health standards, and transparent wage reporting.  \n   - Companies that complied gained \u201cpreferred\u2011partner\u201d status, unlocking faster customs clearance and lower compliance costs\u2014an incentive that directly translated into higher base pay for their workers.\n\n4. **Skill\u2011Building and Up\u2011Skilling Programs**  \n   - The Vietnamese government, leveraging the technical\u2011assistance components of each FTA, launched the **\u201cNational Skills Development Initiative\u201d** (2005\u20112020).  \n   - More than **2\u202fmillion** workers earned certifications in CNC machining, PCB assembly, and quality\u2011control engineering. Certified workers earned on average **18\u202f%** more than non\u2011certified peers and were offered permanent contracts rather than seasonal gigs.\n\n5. **Stabilized Employment Through Diversified Markets**  \n   - Export\u2011oriented firms now sell to a **basket of markets** (U.S., EU, Japan, South Korea, Australia).
