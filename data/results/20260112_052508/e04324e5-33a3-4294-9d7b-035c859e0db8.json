      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases assets\u2014most commonly government bonds and, in some cases, mortgage\u2011backed securities or corporate debt\u2014in order to inject liquidity into the financial system.  By expanding the central bank\u2019s balance sheet, QE lowers longer\u2011term interest rates, raises the price of the assets it buys, and reshapes the flow of credit in the economy.  \n\nThe distributional consequences of QE are not uniform; they depend on the **channels through which the policy works**, the **institutional context** (e.g., the design of the banking system, the fiscal stance, the housing market), and the **time horizon** considered. Below is a synthesis of the main pathways, the groups most directly affected, and the evidence that scholars and policymakers have gathered since QE was first deployed on a large scale after the 2008\u201109 financial crisis.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main Transmission Channels of QE\n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical first\u2011order effects |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Asset\u2011price channel** | Central bank buys securities \u2192 higher prices for those securities \u2192 lower yields \u2192 investors shift into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate). | Rising equity and housing prices; higher valuations of financial assets. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing channel** | Sellers of the purchased securities (mostly banks, pension funds, insurance companies) receive cash that they redeploy into other assets. | Increased demand for corporate bonds, equities, and other securities; lower corporate borrowing costs. |\n| **Interest\u2011rate channel** | Large\u2011scale purchases push down long\u2011term yields, flattening the yield curve. | Lower mortgage rates, lower corporate bond yields, lower long\u2011term government borrowing costs. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Lower domestic yields relative to foreign yields can depreciate the domestic currency (though the effect is muted when QE is coordinated globally). | Potential boost to export\u2011oriented sectors; import\u2011price effects. |\n| **Credit\u2011creation channel** | By improving bank balance sheets (higher\u2011quality assets, lower funding costs), QE can encourage banks to lend more. | Expanded credit to households and firms, though the magnitude varies by banking structure and regulatory environment. |\n| **Expectations / \u201csignalling\u201d channel** | QE signals that the central bank is committed to keeping financing conditions accommodative for an extended period. | Reduced uncertainty, lower risk premia, possible influence on wage\u2011setting and price\u2011setting expectations. |\n\nThese channels interact. For example, a fall in mortgage rates (interest\u2011rate channel) can raise house prices (asset\u2011price channel), which in turn affects household wealth and consumption.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Distributional Impact on Major Economic Groups\n\n### 2.1.

Similar modest employment gains were identified in the Eurozone by the *ECB (2016)*. | The magnitude is modest compared with fiscal stimulus; some studies (e.g., *Romer & Romer, 2020*) argue that QE\u2019s effect on real activity is largely \u201cneutral\u201d once the economy is near full employment. |\n| **Wage pressure** | If QE raises demand for labor, wages may rise, especially in sectors that benefit from cheaper financing (e.g., construction). | Evidence from the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cQE and the labour market\u201d (Bank of England 2019) shows a slight uptick in wages in construction and manufacturing after QE, but the effects fade after a year. | The link between QE\u2011induced asset\u2011price gains and wage growth is weak; many workers do not see wage gains commensurate with asset price rises. |\n| **Job security / sectoral shifts** | QE can boost asset\u2011intensive sectors (financial services, real estate) more than labor\u2011intensive ones. | Studies of the U.S. post\u20112009 period (e.g",
