      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) in a nutshell**  \nQE is a form of unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases large\u2011scale assets (usually government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities) with newly created reserves.  The goal is to lower long\u2011term interest rates, support credit\u2011creation, and lift aggregate demand when the policy\u2011rate is already at or near zero.\n\nBecause QE works through a chain of *transmission mechanisms*\u2014interest\u2011rate effects, portfolio\u2011rebalancing, expectations, and the \u201cwealth effect\u201d\u2014its impact is felt very differently by households, firms, and investors.  Below is a systematic review of what the evidence says, where the academic and policy\u2011maker community agrees, and where genuine debate remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels (the \u201cwhy\u201d)\n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical first\u2011order effect |\n|---------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **Long\u2011term rate channel** | Buying bonds pushes up bond prices \u2192 yields fall \u2192 long\u2011term borrowing costs (mortgages, corporate bonds, sovereign debt) decline. | Cheaper mortgages, cheaper corporate loans \u2192 higher demand for housing and investment. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing (risk\u2011taking) channel** | When safe assets become more expensive (lower yields), investors shift into riskier assets (stocks, high\u2011yield bonds, real estate). | Asset\u2011price rises, lower risk premia, increased credit supply. |\n| **Expectations channel** | Central\u2011bank communication that QE will keep financing conditions easy and prevent deflation. | Higher inflation expectations \u2192 lower real rates; firms may be more willing to invest. |\n| **Liquidity/credit\u2011channel** | QE injects reserves into the banking system; banks can lend more if capital constraints are not binding. | Potential increase in loan volumes, especially to sectors that were credit\u2011constrained. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011multipliers (indirect)** | Lower yields reduce the cost of government borrowing, allowing fiscal stimulus without higher debt service. | Fiscal expansion can boost demand for goods and services. |\n\nThe relative strength of each channel varies across countries and over time, which is a major source of uncertainty in the literature.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Distributional effects \u2013 what the evidence says\n\n### 2.1 Households\n\n| Effect | Evidence (strongest studies) | Who benefits / who may lose |\n|--------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Housing\u2011price boost** | *Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens & Tong (2012)* (UK) \u2013 QE raised house prices by 4\u20116\u202f% in the first two years. <br>*Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack (2011)* (U.S.) \u2013 mortgage\u2011backed securities purchases lowered mortgage rates, raising house\u2011price growth. | Home\u2011owners (especially high\u2011wealth owners) see large wealth gains. Renters and low\u2011income households, who own little or no property, receive little direct benefit. |\n| **Mortgage\u2011rate reduction** | Treasury\u2011bond purchases in the U.S. cut 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgages by ~30\u201140\u202fbps (Federal Reserve, 2014). | Borrowers who can obtain a mortgage (often middle\u2011class families) benefit via lower monthly payments. Those with poor credit or who cannot qualify for a mortgage see little effect. |\n| **Stock\u2011market gains** | *Bivens (2015)* finds that QE increased S&P\u2011500 returns by ~0.5\u20111\u202f% per quarter, mainly through a risk\u2011rebalancing channel. | Households that hold equities (directly or via retirement accounts) gain; the gains are highly concentrated among higher\u2011income, higher\u2011wealth families. |\n| **Pension\u2011fund",
