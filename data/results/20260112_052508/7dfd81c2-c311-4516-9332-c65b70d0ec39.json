It is organized by the mechanisms through which FTAs can affect labour markets, the empirical findings that have emerged, the points on which most researchers agree, and the areas that remain contested.  Wherever possible I note the type of study (e.g., meta\u2011analysis, case study, natural experiment) and the range of estimated effects, so you can see how robust the conclusions are.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
