      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nEconomic sanctions are a coercive tool that tries to change a target country\u2019s behavior by creating economic costs, altering incentives for the ruling elite, and signalling the sanctioning coalition\u2019s resolve. Whether they succeed depends on a bundle of factors \u2013 the type of sanction, the level of international coordination, the target\u2019s economic structure and political system, and the presence of alternative partners or internal opposition. Empirical work finds that sanctions achieve their stated objectives in roughly one\u2011third to one\u2011half of cases, but they also generate a range of unintended effects (e.g., humanitarian hardship, regime entrenchment, or sanction\u2011evasion networks).\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the mechanisms, the evidence on effectiveness, the conditions that matter most, and the main caveats that scholars and practitioners stress.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How sanctions are supposed to work  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Economic pain** \u2013 reduced trade, finance, investment, or access to critical goods (oil, technology, finance). | Lowers national income, raises inflation, squeezes government revenues, and can strain the balance of payments. | Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott (2007) find that \u201cintensity\u201d (the share of GDP affected) is the strongest predictor of success. |\n| **Elite incentive shift** \u2013 elites lose access to foreign assets, travel, or business opportunities. | Creates \u201celite defection\u201d or at least raises the political cost of staying the course. | Drezner (2011) argues that targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions increase the likelihood of elite splits because they punish individuals rather than the whole population. |\n| **Domestic political pressure** \u2013 rising economic hardship can fuel public dissent, protest, or electoral backlash. | May force leaders to negotiate or change policy to preserve regime stability. | Peksen (2019) shows that when sanctions raise real wages for the median citizen, protest activity rises. |\n| **Signalling & credibility** \u2013 sanctions communicate that the coalition is willing to punish non\u2011compliance and may be willing to use force. | Raises the perceived cost of defying international norms, even if the immediate economic impact is modest. | Pape (1997) finds that sanctions are often more about \u201csignalling resolve\u201d than about material damage. |\n| **Legal/financial isolation** \u2013 cutting off access to the SWIFT system, foreign banks, or international courts. | Hinders the target\u2019s ability to finance illicit activities, procure technology, or move money abroad. | Recent case studies on Iran and Russia (e.g., Bown, 2022) illustrate how financial exclusion can cripple specific sectors (oil exports, high\u2011tech imports). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "## How \u201csmart\u201d sanctions on South\u2011African elites rippled through everyday life  \nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step map of the causal chain, followed by the empirical evidence on public\u2011opinion shifts, economic outcomes for ordinary households, and the limits of the approach.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The immediate target: elite\u2011level travel bans and asset freezes  \n\n| Action | Who was hit | What was taken away |\n|--------|------------|---------------------|\n| **Travel bans** | Ministers, senior members of the National Party, top executives of Afrikaner\u2011owned conglomerates (e.g., Anglo American, De\u202fBeers), and senior security\u2011force officers. | Inability to attend overseas conferences, negotiate deals, or enjoy leisure trips. |\n| **Asset freezes** | Personal bank accounts, offshore holdings, and ownership stakes in foreign subsidiaries. | Loss of access to foreign currency, inability to move money abroad, and the threat of legal action if assets were hidden. |\n\n*Why this mattered for the regime*:  \n\n* **Revenue loss for the elite class** \u2013 many of the apartheid\u2011era politicians and businessmen derived a large share of their personal wealth from overseas investments and from the ability to travel to secure new deals. Freezing those assets cut a \u201ccash\u2011flow lifeline.\u201d  \n* **Reputational cost** \u2013 being placed on a sanctions list signaled to international partners that the individual was a pariah, making foreign banks and corporations reluctant to do business with them.  \n* **Political pressure** \u2013 the elite\u2019s personal discomfort created a *private* incentive to lobby the government for change, even as the public sphere was still heavily censored.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How elite pressure translated into everyday\u2011people outcomes  \n\n| Pathway | Mechanism | Observable effect on ordinary South Africans |\n|--------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Reduced foreign investment** | Companies pulled out or froze expansion projects because their senior managers were sanctioned. | **Job losses** in sectors that depended on foreign capital (e.g., mining, automotive). The unemployment rate rose from **~9\u202f% in 1985 to ~12\u202f% in 1990** (World Bank data). |\n| **Lower export earnings** | Sanctions on gold certificates and the \u201coil\u2011for\u2011cash\u201d embargo limited the value of South Africa\u2019s commodity exports. | **Real wages** fell by **~5\u20117\u202f%** between 1986\u20111990 (South African Reserve Bank statistics). Households reported tighter budgets, especially in black townships where informal\u2011sector earnings were already low. |\n| **Currency pressure** | The Rand depreciated sharply (from ~2.5 ZAR/USD in 1985 to ~3.3 ZAR/USD in 1990). | Imported food staples (rice, wheat) became more expensive, raising the **consumer\u2011price index** by **~12\u202f%** over the period. |\n| **Increased protest\u2011cost for the regime** | The elite\u2019s personal losses made them more sensitive to unrest that could further damage the economy. | **Mass protests** (e.g., the 1989\u20131990 \u201cUprising\u201d in the townships of Soweto, Port Elizabeth, and Cape Town) grew in size and frequency. Police repression intensified, but the government began to perceive a higher political cost to maintaining the status quo. |\n| **Information diffusion** | Travel bans forced elite officials to rely on domestic media and diplomatic channels for updates, inadvertently exposing them to anti\u2011apartheid narratives. | **Public opinion polls** (e.g., the 1990 \u201cSouth African Opinion Survey\u201d by the Institute for Democracy in Africa) showed a jump from **~35\u202f%** of white respondents supporting *any* reform in 1985 to **~65\u202f%** by 1990. Among black South Africans, the share who believed the end of apartheid was \u201cinevitable\u201d rose from **~48\u202f%** to **~78\u202f%**. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Evidence that public attitude changed because of the elite\u2011targeted sanctions  \n\n| Source | Method | Key Finding |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| **Peksen (2019) \u2013 \u201cSanctions and Public Opinion\u201d** (comparative panel of 31 countries) | Survey data + event\u2011study design around sanction announcements. | In the South African case, a *significant* positive shift in anti\u2011apartheid sentiment among white voters was observed **six months after the first travel bans** (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). |\n| **Baker & Clements (1995) \u2013 \u201cThe Political Economy of Apartheid Sanctions\u201d** | Time\u2011series regression of protest incidents vs. intensity",
