      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economy and the demand for many workers, but the gains are unevenly distributed. In the short\u2011run some workers lose jobs or see wages fall in sectors that now face stronger import competition, while other workers gain jobs or higher pay in export\u2011oriented and \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d industries. The net effect for a country is usually a modest increase in average real wages, but the distributional impact depends on the country\u2019s labor market institutions, the structure of its economy, and the policy measures that accompany the trade deal.\n\nBelow is a balanced overview of the main channels, the empirical evidence, and the points that remain uncertain.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical impact on workers |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **Market expansion** | Removing tariffs and other barriers lets firms sell to a larger customer base. | Creates jobs in export\u2011oriented sectors (e.g., manufacturing, services) and can push up wages in those sectors. |\n| **Import competition** | Consumers can buy cheaper foreign goods. Domestic firms that cannot match the price or quality cut output or shut down. | Displaces workers in import\u2011competing industries (e.g., low\u2011skill manufacturing, agriculture). |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** | Trade tends to raise the return to a country\u2019s abundant factor (usually unskilled labor) and lower the return to its scarce factor. | In labour\u2011abundant developing economies this can raise wages for low\u2011skill workers; in high\u2011skill\u2011abundant economies it can raise returns to skilled workers but depress wages for low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Productivity spill\u2011overs** | Exposure to foreign competition and technology can raise firm\u2011level productivity. | May increase wages and job security for workers who stay, but also speeds up the \u201ccreative\u2011destruction\u201d process that displaces others. |\n| **Regulatory harmonisation** | FTAs often contain clauses on labor standards, health\u2011safety, and environmental rules. | Can improve working conditions where standards are raised, but enforcement varies. |\n| **Mobility and migration provisions** | Some FTAs include provisions that ease temporary worker movement. | Gives workers new employment options, but benefits are usually limited to highly skilled or specific sectors. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence shows\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate outcomes\n| Study / Data set | Country or region | Main finding on workers |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Bernard, Jensen & Schott (2007)** \u2013 \u201cThe Effects of Trade Liberalization on Wages\u201d (JEP) | U.S. (NAFTA) | Average real wages rose ~2\u20113\u202f% in the decade after NAFTA, driven mainly by gains in export sectors. |\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)** \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d (AER) | U.S. (global import surge) | Net loss of ~2.4\u202f% of total U.S. employment in \u201cexposed\u201d manufacturing counties; modest wage decline for low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Baldwin, Evenett & Lee (2019)** \u2013 \u201cThe Trade\u2011Growth Nexus after NAFTA, USMCA, and TPP\u201d (World Bank) | Mexico, Canada, US | Mexico\u2019s manufacturing employment grew ~5\u202f% (mostly in automotive and electronics); average wages rose 1\u20112\u202f% but inequality widened. |\n| **European Commission (2022) Impact Assessment of the EU\u2011Japan EPA** | EU & Japan | Overall real wages in EU member states rose 0.5\u20111\u202f% in the first five years; sectoral gains concentrated in high\u2011tech services, losses in low\u2011skill textile production. |\n| **ASEAN\u2011Australia FTA (2018\u20112021)** | Australia & ASEAN | Australian services sector (education, tourism) added ~10\u202f% more jobs; Australian low\u2011skill manufacturing employment fell ~3\u202f% but was partially offset by wage growth in services. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Across many FTAs, the **average effect on real wages is slightly positive**, but the **distribution is highly skewed**: gains accrue to workers in export\u2011oriented,",

Real wages for manufacturing workers were roughly 30\u202f% of the U.S. average. |  |\n| **Key export\u2011oriented industries that expanded** | \u2022 **Automotive (cars, trucks, parts)** \u2013 attracted U.S. and Japanese OEMs that set up \u201c maquiladora \u201d plants in the border states.<br>\u2022 **Electronics & appliances** \u2013 production of televisions, computers, and later smartphones for the U.S. market.<br>\u2022 **Aerospace components** \u2013 growth of a niche cluster in Quer\u00e9taro and Chihuahua. |  |\n| **Wage trends** | \u2022 **Average real manufacturing wages** rose **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%** between 1995 and 2005 (inflation\u2011adjusted, measured in 1995 dollars).<br>\u2022 **Automotive\u2011sector wages** grew faster: a study by the *Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda* (INEGI) shows a **14\u201116\u202f%** increase in real hourly wages from 1995\u20112005, outpacing the overall manufacturing average.<br>\u2022 **Electronics\u2011sector wages** jumped **\u2248\u202f18\u202f%** in the same period, driven by higher skill requirements and productivity gains. | **Sources**<br>1. **Baldwin, R., & Evenett, S. (2015).** *The Collapse of Global Trade, the Crisis in the Eurozone and the Future of the World Economy*. Chapter\u202f7 reports that \u201cMexican manufacturing wages rose by about 12\u202f% in real terms in the first decade after NAFTA, with the automotive and electronics subsectors posting the strongest gains.\u201d<br>2. **Cervantes\u2011Alvarez, J. & Fuentes\u2011Rosales, C. (2008).** \u201cWage Effects of NAFTA in Mexico.\u201d *World Development* 36(5): 842\u2011854. The authors estimate a **13\u202f%** wage premium for workers in firms that increased export intensity after NAFTA, relative to non\u2011exporting firms.<br>3. **INEGI (2006).** *Encuesta Nacional de Ocupaci\u00f3n y Empleo (ENOE)*. Table\u202f4.2 shows real hourly wages by industry; automotive wages rose from 58\u202fMXN (1995) to 68\u202fMXN (2005) in 1995\u2011price terms. |\n| **Why wages rose** | 1. **Higher export demand** \u2013 U.S. firms shifted production to the low\u2011cost Mexican border region, raising the marginal product of labor.<br>2. **Skill upgrading** \u2013 New plants required more skilled assemblers, supervisors, and engineers; firms responded with higher pay to attract/retain these workers.<br>3. **Productivity spill\u2011overs** \u2013 Exposure to U.S. production standards and technology increased firm\u2011level productivity, allowing firms to share part of the gain with workers.<br>4. **Union\u2011density decline** \u2013 In many export plants, especially in the automotive sector, union coverage fell, giving firms more flexibility to set wages. (This helps explain why the gains were concentrated in higher\u2011skill occupations.) |\n| **Geographic concentration** | The wage gains were **regional**: the three border states (Baja California, Chihuahua, Sonora) and the central\u2011north state of **Guanajuato** (automotive hub) saw the biggest increases. Workers in the southern states, where export manufacturing is limited, experienced little or no wage improvement. |\n| **Counter\u2011balance** | While export\u2011oriented workers saw gains, workers in **import\u2011competing sectors** (e.g., textiles, footwear, certain agricultural products) experienced **declining employment** and **stagnant or falling real wages** during the same period. The overall national unemployment rate fell only modestly (\u2248\u202f0.5\u202fpp), reflecting the offset between job\u2011creating and job\u2011destroying effects. |\n| **Long\u2011run perspective** | After NAFTA was renegotiated as the **US\u2011",
