Each cell radiates at a few watts, far less than a typical TV broadcast tower. |\n| **Beamforming & Massive MIMO** | Antenna arrays (often 64\u2011256 elements) that can shape the radio beam in real time. | Instead of broadcasting in all directions, the tower steers a narrow beam toward each device, improving throughput and reducing wasted radiation. |\n| **Back\u2011haul** | Fiber\u2011optic or microwave links that carry traffic from the tower to the core network. | Not part of the RF exposure to the public; it simply moves the data to the internet. |\n| **Power levels** | Typical Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) for a macro\u2011cell: 10\u2013100\u202fW (depending on band). Small cells: <\u202f10\u202fW. | These are comparable to, or lower than, the power of many everyday wireless devices (Wi\u2011Fi routers, Bluetooth, cordless phones). |\n\n**Key technical points that matter for health**\n\n1. **Non\u2011ionizing radiation** \u2013 5\u202fG uses RF waves (\u2248\u202f10\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f100\u202fGHz). Their photon energy is far below the ionization threshold (\u2248\u202f10\u202feV). They cannot break chemical bonds or damage DNA directly, unlike X\u2011rays or gamma rays.  \n2. **Exposure metrics** \u2013 Regulators limit **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)** for devices (\u2264\u202f1.6\u202fW/kg in the US, 2\u202fW/kg in Europe) and **Power Density** for base stations (\u2264\u202f10\u202fW/m\u00b2 for frequencies 2\u2013300\u202fGHz in most jurisdictions). 5\u202fG towers are designed to stay well under these limits.  \n3. **Beamforming** \u2013 Because the beam follows the user, the average power density at any fixed point near a tower is even lower than for an omnidirectional antenna of the same total output.  \n\n---\n\n### What the scientific evidence says about health\n\n| Source / Organization | Main conclusion (as of 2024) | Caveats / Ongoing work |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 International EMF Project** | \u201cTo date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by exposure to the RF fields below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).\u201d | WHO continues to monitor new studies; the review covers all frequencies up to 300\u202fGHz, which includes 5\u202fG. |\n| **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)** | Classified RF electromagnetic fields (including those used in mobile communications) as **Group\u202f2B \u2013 \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans.\u201d** | This classification is based on limited evidence of an increased risk of glioma & acoustic neuroma from",

(If an operator wants the ultra\u2011high\u2011speed mmWave capacity, they will add many more \u201cpico\u2011cells\u201d on top of the same mid\u2011band grid.)\n\n### 2.2.
