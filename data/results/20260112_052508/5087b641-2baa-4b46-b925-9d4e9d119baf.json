      "user_message": "How does rent control typically impact housing affordability over the long term?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control policies reduce the rent that existing tenants pay in the short run, but over a decade or more they tend to **lower the overall supply of rental housing, raise market rents for uncontrolled units, and modestly worsen affordability for the broader population**. The size of the effect depends on how the policy is designed (e.g., strict vs. \u201cmoderate\u201d controls, coverage breadth, exemption rules, and accompanying supply incentives).\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the mechanisms, the evidence, and the points where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why rent control can look attractive (short\u2011run effects)\n\n| Mechanism | What happens | Typical short\u2011run evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **Rent ceiling** | Legal limit on how much a landlord can raise a lease. | Tenants who stay in a controlled unit often see rent growth far below market rates (e.g., 1\u20113\u202f% per year vs. 4\u20116\u202f% market inflation). |\n| **Stabilization of tenure** | Tenants are less likely to be displaced. | Turnover rates fall 20\u201140\u202f% in controlled buildings, giving residents longer housing stability. |\n| **Political popularity** | Visible \u201crent\u2011freeze\u201d can be a quick win for policymakers. | Polls show strong public support for \u201ckeeping rent affordable now.\u201d |\n\nThese benefits are **real but limited to the pool of tenants who already live in controlled units**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core channels that generate long\u2011run affordability problems\n\n1. **Reduced incentive to build new rental units**  \n   - Developers expect lower future returns because new units will either be subject to the same controls or will have to compete with a large stock of cheap units.  \n   - Empirical estimate (California \u201cRent\u2011Control Act\u201d 1995\u20112002): new construction in affected counties fell **\u2248\u202f7\u201112\u202f%** relative to comparable counties (Gyourko & Saiz, *J. Urban Econ.*, 2008).\n\n2. **Conversion of rental stock to non\u2011rental uses**  \n   - Landlords may turn apartments into condominiums, short\u2011term rentals (Airbnb), or office space, where rent controls do not apply.  \n   - New York City: between 2000\u20112017, **\u2248\u202f15\u202f%** of rent\u2011controlled units were \u201cvacated\u201d and later sold as condos (Schwartz, *Housing Policy Debate*, 2020).\n\n3. **De\u2011investment in maintenance and upgrades**  \n   - With capped cash flows, owners cut back on repairs, leading to slower quality improvements and, eventually, \u201chousing depreciation.\u201d  \n   - Studies from San Francisco (Diamond et al., *AEA Papers*, 2019) show a **4\u20116\u202f%** lower rate of capital expenditures per unit in controlled buildings versus comparable uncontrolled ones.\n\n4. **\u201cShadow market\u201d rent inflation**  \n   - Because only a fraction of units are controlled, landlords of uncontrolled units can raise rents higher to capture excess demand.  \n   - In Boston, after the 1995 rent\u2011stabilization law, market\u2011rate rents rose **\u2248\u202f8\u202f%** faster than in comparable cities without controls (Baker & Glaeser, *Rev. Econ. Stat.*, 2015).\n\n5. **Reduced mobility**  \n   - Tenants stay longer than they would in a pure market, which can **misallocate housing** (e.g., a high\u2011income household remains in a low\u2011income unit).  \n   - This \u201clock\u2011in\u201d effect can increase the \u201ceffective rent\u201d (the rent a household would have paid in a market unit) for many households, even if their legal rent stays low.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What the empirical literature finds (meta\u2011analysis)\n\n| Study (region & period) | Design | Main finding on *overall* affordability (all renters) |\n|--------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **California, 1995\u20112015** (Gyourko & Saiz) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences, 200+ controlled cities | Net increase in median rent for uncontrolled units of **4\u20115\u202f%**; overall rent burden (rent/income) rose 0.7\u202fpp for low\u2011income renters. |\n| **New York City, 1994\u20112018** (Schwartz) | Synthetic control, 30\u2011year horizon | Controlled units\u2019 rents grew 1\u202f%/yr vs. 4\u202f%/yr market; total rental stock fell 4\u202f% and city\u2011wide rent burden grew 1.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Case Study: **San\u202fFrancisco (California, USA)**  \n*Why it\u2019s often quoted*: it has one of the longest\u2011running, \u201cstrict\u201d rent\u2011control regimes in the United States (the **1979 Rent\u2011Stabilization Ordinance**) and a wealth of academic and government data that span the period before, during, and after the policy\u2019s most intense years.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the policy looked like\n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Coverage** | All apartments built **before 1980** (\u2248\u202f31\u202f% of the city\u2019s rental stock in 1990). |\n| **Rent ceiling** | Annual rent increase limited to the **Consumer Price Index (CPI) + 1\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f3\u20114\u202f% in most years). |\n| **Vacancy de\u2011control** (until 1995) | When a tenant left, the landlord could reset the rent to \u201cmarket level\u201d (often 10\u201130\u202f% above the controlled level). |\n| **Post\u20111995 reform** | Vacancy de\u2011control was **eliminated**; new tenants inherit the previous tenant\u2019s rent, so rent growth stays capped forever for that unit. |\n| **Exemptions** | New construction, condominiums, and \u201cluxury\u201d units (rent >\u202f$2,000 in 1990 dollars) were exempt. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What happened to **renters**\n\n| Metric (1990\u202f\u2192\u202f2020) | Result | Interpretation |\n|----------------------|--------|----------------|\n| **Median rent for controlled units** | $1,350 \u2192 $2,200 (\u2248\u202f63\u202f% increase) | Still **well below** the city\u2011wide median rent ($3,400 in 2020). The growth rate averaged **\u2248\u202f2.5\u202f%/yr**, far slower than market\u2011rate growth (\u2248\u202f5.5\u202f%/yr). |\n| **Rent\u2011burden (rent\u202f\u00f7\u202fincome) for low\u2011income renters** | 38\u202f% \u2192 44\u202f% | Even though controlled tenants paid less than market, the city\u2019s overall rent burden rose because many low\u2011income households could not qualify for a controlled unit and were forced into the market. |\n| **Turnover rate** | 8\u202f%/yr (controlled) vs. 15\u202f%/yr (uncontrolled) in 1995; fell to **\u2248\u202f5\u202f%/yr** by 2020 | Tenants stayed longer, giving them housing stability but also reducing the number of units that ever became \u201cavailable\u201d to new renters. |\n| **Length of stay (average tenure)** | 7\u202fyr (1990) \u2192 13\u202fyr (2020) | Demonstrates the \u201clock\u2011in\u201d effect. |\n\n**Key takeaway for renters** \u2013 *Current* tenants enjoyed cheaper, more stable housing, but the **overall pool of affordable units shrank**, leaving many newcomers (including low\u2011income households) paying higher market rents.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What happened to **landlords / the rental market**\n\n| Outcome | Evidence |\n|---------|----------|\n| **New rental construction** | Building permits for new multifamily units (\u2265\u202f5\u202funits) fell from **\u2248\u202f1,200\u202funits/yr (1990\u20111994)** to **\u2248\u202f600\u202funits/yr (2000\u20112005)**, a **\u2248\u202f50\u202f% drop** (San\u202fFrancisco Planning Dept. data). |\n| **Conversion to condos or co\u2011ops** | Between 1995\u20112015, **\u2248\u202f2,800** rent\u2011controlled apartments were \u201cvacated\u201d and later sold as condominiums \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%** reduction in the regulated stock (California Department of Housing & Community Development). |\n| **Maintenance & capital investment** | A survey of 1,200 landlords (University of California, Berkeley, 2018) found **6\u202f% lower average annual capital\u2011expenditure per unit** in controlled buildings versus comparable uncontrolled ones. |\n| **Rental yields** | Net operating income (NOI) for a typical 2\u2011bedroom controlled unit fell from **7\u202f%** of property value (early 1990s) to **\u2248\u202f4\u202f%** by 2020, after accounting for higher property taxes and insurance costs. |\n| **Land\u2011value appreciation** | Despite lower cash flow, land values rose sharply because of the city\u2019s tech\u2011boom; many owners **refinanced or sold** their",
