      "user_message": "Can you explain what the current scientific consensus is on the safety of genetically modified foods for human consumption?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of scientific bodies that evaluate food safety conclude that **the genetically\u2011modified (GM) crops and foods that have passed regulatory review are as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts**.  This conclusion is based on decades of peer\u2011reviewed research, systematic reviews, and meta\u2011analyses covering nutrition, toxicology, allergenicity, and human health outcomes.  \n\nAt the same time, scientists continue to stress **case\u2011by\u2011case risk assessment**, long\u2011term monitoring, and transparency because:\n\n* each GM event introduces a different DNA construct and may have different traits.  \n* some methodological gaps (e.g., very long\u2011term epidemiology) are difficult to close, so precautionary measures are recommended.  \n\nBelow is a detailed, source\u2011rich overview of how that consensus was reached, where the evidence is strongest, and where legitimate scientific uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cscientific consensus\u201d means in this context\n\n| Aspect | Typical statement of consensus | Key organisations that have issued it (selected) |\n|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Overall safety of approved GM foods** | \u201cNo credible evidence that currently approved GM foods are less safe than conventional foods.\u201d | WHO (2004, 2022), FAO/IAEA/ISAAA (2019), US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) (2016), European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (2022), Australian Government Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) (2020), Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) (2021). |\n| **Nutritional equivalence** | \u201cNutrient composition of GM crops is substantially equivalent to that of the non\u2011GM comparator, unless the trait is intended to alter nutrition.\u201d | Codex Alimentarius (2003), USDA (2020), EFSA (2022). |\n| **Allergenicity & toxicology** | \u201cNo increased allergenic or toxic risk has been demonstrated for approved GM foods.\u201d | WHO/FAO (2004), NASEM (2016), EFSA (2022). |\n| **Environmental & indirect health impacts** (e.g., herbicide use) | \u201cEnvironmental risk assessments are required; the majority of GM crops do not pose greater environmental hazards than conventional crops.\u201d | EFSA (2022), European Commission (2021), US EPA (2020). |\n| **Need for case\u2011by\u2011case assessment** | \u201cEach GM event must be evaluated on its own molecular and phenotypic characteristics.\u201d | WHO (2004, 2022), NASEM (2016), EFSA (2022). |\n\n*The exact wording varies, but the core message is consistent across the major international and national bodies.*\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The trait allows farmers to spray glyphosate to control weeds without harming the crop.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of the **safety assessment pipeline** that the event has passed in the United States, the European Union, Canada, Brazil, and Japan.
