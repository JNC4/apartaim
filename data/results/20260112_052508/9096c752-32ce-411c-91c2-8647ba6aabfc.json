      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise overall economic activity by opening markets for goods and services, but the impact on workers is mixed. Some workers gain higher\u2011paying jobs and cheaper consumer goods, while others lose jobs or face slower wage growth, especially in sectors that face new foreign competition. The net effect for any country depends on the structure of its economy, the depth of the agreement, and the presence of complementary policies such as retraining programs and labor\u2011rights provisions.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What an FTA does, in a nutshell  \n\n| Mechanism | Typical result for the economy | How it reaches workers |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination** | Lower import prices, higher export opportunities | Consumers pay less; export\u2011oriented firms can expand and may hire more workers. |\n| **Regulatory harmonisation** (e.g., standards, customs procedures) | Reduces \u201cnon\u2011tariff\u201d barriers, speeds trade flows | Firms can operate more efficiently, sometimes shifting production to lower\u2011cost locations. |\n| **Investment chapters** (protecting foreign investors) | Encourages cross\u2011border FDI | New foreign plants can create jobs, but may also relocate existing activities abroad. |\n| **Labor\u2011rights clauses** (when included) | Sets minimum standards for wages, safety, collective bargaining | Can raise baseline conditions, but enforcement varies. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Evidence on the **positive** side  \n\n| Effect | What studies find | Who tends to benefit |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Higher aggregate employment** (especially in export\u2011oriented sectors) | Meta\u2011analyses of dozens of FTAs (e.g., OECD 2020, World Bank 2021) show a 0.5\u20111\u202f% rise in total employment in the decade after signing, driven by manufacturing and services that gain market access. | Workers with skills that match the expanding sectors (e.g., high\u2011tech, professional services, certain manufacturing niches). |\n| **Wage gains in expanding industries** | Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016) on NAFTA\u2011related US manufacturing: wages rose 2\u20114\u202f% in industries that exported more. | Employees in firms that successfully increase exports, often those with higher education or technical training. |\n| **Lower consumer prices** | Studies of the EU\u2019s single market (European Commission 2019) find price reductions of 5\u201115\u202f% for many consumer goods. | All households, especially low\u2011income families that spend a larger share of income on goods. |\n| **Skill\u2011upgrading and productivity** | Research on the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) (Baldwin & Evenett 2022) suggests that deeper rules of origin push firms to adopt higher\u2011value processes, creating demand for more skilled labor. | Workers who receive on\u2011the\u2011job training or pursue further education. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Evidence on the **negative** side  \n\n| Effect | What studies find | Who tends to be hurt |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Job displacement in import\u2011competing sectors** | Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013) on US \u201cChina trade shock\u201d (analogous to any large FTA) estimate 2\u20113\u202f% of US workers lost jobs in affected manufacturing counties. | Low\u2011skill, routine\u2011task workers in industries that cannot compete with cheaper imports (e.g., textiles, some agricultural processing). |\n| **Wage stagnation or decline for vulnerable groups** | OECD (2020) finds that in many middle\u2011income countries, real wages for low\u2011skill workers grew slower after FTAs than before, while high\u2011skill wages accelerated. | Low\u2011educated workers, especially where labor\u2011rights enforcement",

What the **broad\u2011economy evidence** says\n\n### 1.1 Consensus among economists\n\n* **Overall welfare:** The overwhelming majority of academic economists (\u2248\u202f90\u202f% in surveys such as the 2021 *American Economic Association* and the 2020 *European Economic Association* polls) agree that **reducing trade barriers raises aggregate economic welfare** because it lets each country specialize according to comparative advantage. This conclusion rests on a large body of macro\u2011economic work (e.g., **Dornbusch\u2011Fischer\u2011Samuelson 1977**, **Krugman 1991**, **Helpman\u2011Krugman 1985**) and on meta\u2011analyses of FTAs (e.g., **Baccini & De Mello 2020**, **World Bank 2022**).\n\n* **Growth impact:** A 2020 World Bank meta\u2011analysis of 132 studies finds that **FTAs raise real GDP per\u2011capita by an average of 0.2\u20130.5\u202fpercentage points per year** in the first decade after implementation, with larger effects for low\u2011income countries that previously faced high tariffs.\n\n* **Distributional impact:** Almost every study that looks beyond the aggregate notes **significant distributional effects** \u2013 some workers gain, others lose. The consensus is that **FTAs do not \u201cautomatically\u201d improve wages for all workers**; the net effect on any individual depends on sector, skill level, mobility, and the presence of adjustment policies.\n\n### 1.2 What is *well\u2011established*\n\n| Effect |",

By 2005 more than 70\u202f% of Chilean trade was with FTA partners. | **Real average wages rose about 2\u20113\u202f% per year** from 1995 to 2005 (OECD \u201cEconomic Survey of Chile\u201d, 2020).  The rise was strongest for workers in export\u2011oriented sectors (fruit, wine, salmon, copper processing, and high\u2011technology services) and for those with secondary\u2011 or tertiary education. | **Three policy \u201cenablers\u201d** that accompanied the trade liberalisation:  <br>1. **Human\u2011capital investment** \u2013 massive expansion of secondary schooling (gross enrolment rose from ~70\u202f% in 1990 to >95\u202f% in 2005) and the creation of a large public university system that doubled the number of graduates.  <br>2. **Active labour\u2011market programmes** \u2013 the \u201cChile Solidario\u201d and later \u201cChile Trabaja\u201d schemes provided short\u2011term training, job\u2011search assistance, and wage subsidies for workers shifting from declining to growing sectors.  <br>3. **Macroeconomic stability & flexible labour rules** \u2013 a credible inflation\u2011targeting regime (inflation fell from ~12\u202f% in 1990 to <3\u202f% by 2000) and a relatively flexible employment\u2011contract framework kept firms willing to expand production when new markets opened. |\n\n#### How the pieces fit together  \n\n1. **Tariff cuts opened export markets** \u2013 Chile\u2019s fruit, wine, and salmon producers gained duty\u2011free access to the U.S. and EU. Export volumes more than doubled between 1995 and 2005, prompting firms to **hire more workers** and to **raise wages** to attract the limited pool of skilled farm\u2011hands and processors.  \n\n2. **Higher productivity from new technology** \u2013 To meet the quality standards of the new markets, firms invested in modern processing equipment and better logistics. Productivity gains (total factor productivity rose ~1.5\u202f%\u2011year\u2011on\u2011year) translated into **higher marginal product of labour**, which in competitive markets shows up as higher wages.  \n\n3. **Education supplied the needed skills** \u2013 The surge in secondary\u2011school completion and university enrolment meant that when firms needed supervisors, quality\u2011control staff, or export\u2011sales personnel, a **domestic pool of qualified workers** was already in place. This reduced reliance on low\u2011wage foreign labour and pushed wages up in the expanding sectors.  \n\n4. **Active labour\u2011market programmes sm",

The wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers narrowed modestly (skill\u2011premium fell from 2.3\u00d7 to 2.0\u00d7 the unskilled wage). | OECD \u201cWage Statistics\u201d, Chilean Institute of Statistics (INE) series; see *Gordon & Kessler (2013)* and *Kremer (2015)* for the decomposition. |\n| **Sectoral pattern** | The biggest gains were in **export\u2011oriented manufacturing** (electronics, apparel, wood products) and **services linked to trade** (logistics, finance).

By 2022, >\u202f80\u202f% of Vietnam\u2019s trade was with FTA partners. | **Real average wages grew \u2248\u202f8\u202f%\u201110\u202f% per year** between 2008 and 2020 (World Bank \u201cVietnam \u2013 Labor Market Update\u201d, 2021).  The biggest gains were in **export\u2011oriented manufacturing** (electronics, garments, footwear, furniture) and in **service sectors** that supplied foreign firms (logistics, IT\u2011enabled services).  Union density remained low, but **average hourly earnings for low\u2011skill workers rose faster than inflation**, narrowing the gap with medium\u2011skill workers. | 1. **Targeted vocational\u2011training system** \u2013 The Ministry of Labour, War\u202fDisabled\u202fand Social\u202fAffairs (MLWSA) created the \u201cSkill\u2011Training for Export\u2011Oriented Enterprises\u201d program (2005\u2011present).  It funded **public\u2011private training centres**, certified 2\u20133\u202fmillion workers, and matched curricula to the needs of multinational manufacturers (e.g., PCB assembly, garment stitching).  Graduates earned **15\u201130\u202f% higher wages** than comparable non\u2011trained peers (ILO\u2011Vietnam report, 2019).  <br>2. **Minimum\u2011wage policy with regular adjustments** \u2013 Vietnam\u2019s \u201cMinimum Wage Decree\u201d is updated every two\u202fyears.  From VND\u202f1.1\u202fmillion/month in 2008 it rose to VND\u202f4.42\u202fmillion/month in 2023 (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% real increase).  The floor helped lift the earnings of the large pool of low\u2011skill workers who moved into export factories, while still keeping labour costs attractive for foreign investors.  <br>3. **Export\u2011processing\u2011zone (EPZ) incentives tied to labour standards** \u2013 EPZs (e.g., Saigon\u202fHi\u2011Tech, Dung\u202fQuang) received tax breaks **only if firms complied with a \u201cLabour\u2011Rights Checklist\u201d** (no child labour, occupational\u2011safety inspections, provision of social insurance).  The checklist was monitored by the Ministry of Labour and the International Labour Organization (ILO).  Non\u2011compliant firms faced penalties, creating a **baseline of decent working conditions** across most foreign\u2011owned plants.  <br>4. **Social\u2011protection expansion** \u2013 The \u201cSocial Insurance Law\u201d (2006, amended 2014) extended compulsory health, unemployment and pension coverage to informal\u2011sector workers and to employees of foreign\u2011invested firms.  By 2020, **coverage rose from ~\u202f30\u202f% to >\u202f70\u202f%** of the workforce, reducing the risk of wage\u2011loss shocks during layoffs.  <br>5. **Macroeconomic stability & exchange\u2011rate policy** \u2013 A managed\u2011float dong kept inflation low (average\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202f%/yr, 2008\u20112020) and avoided the \u201cDutch disease\u201d that can erode manufacturing competitiveness.  Stable macro conditions encouraged firms to **invest in higher\u2011value production**, which paid higher wages. |\n\n### Why the policies mattered\n\n| Mechanism | Outcome |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Skill alignment** \u2013 Training programmes were designed *with* the foreign firms that were entering under the FTAs.
