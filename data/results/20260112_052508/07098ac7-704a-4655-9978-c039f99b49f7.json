What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Element | Typical design | Variations you may see |\n|---------|----------------|------------------------|\n| **Goal** | Remove firearms from private hands in hopes of lowering the pool of weapons that could be used in crimes, suicides, or accidental shootings. | Some programs are framed as \u201csafety\u2011promotion\u201d or \u201ccommunity\u2011service\u201d events rather than strictly \u201ccrime\u2011prevention.\u201d |\n| **Funding** | Usually municipal, state, or federal money; sometimes private\u2011sector or nonprofit grants. | In Australia the 1996 program was funded by a national levy on firearms. In the U.S. many city programs rely on a one\u2011off grant from the Department of Justice or local police budgets. |\n| **Incentive to turn in guns** | Cash (e.g., $50\u2013$500 per firearm), gift cards, vouchers, or \u201cpoints\u201d that can be exchanged for merchandise. | Some programs offer *no\u2011cash* incentives (e.g., a \u201cfree\u2011for\u2011all\u201d collection box) or only non\u2011monetary rewards. |\n| **Eligibility** | Any resident who can legally possess a firearm (often no background check is required because the gun is being surrendered, not transferred). | Some jurisdictions restrict turn\u2011ins to **unregistered** or **illegal** firearms; others accept all firearms, including those that are legally owned. |\n| **Logistics** | Fixed\u2011date \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events at police stations, community centers, or malls; mobile vans that travel to neighborhoods; or permanent drop\u2011off sites. | Continuous \u201cmail\u2011in\u201d or \u201conline\u201d buybacks exist in a few places (e.g., New Zealand\u2019s 2020 post\u2011Christchurch program). |\n| **Disposition of surrendered guns** | Typically destroyed (shredded, melted, or otherwise rendered inoperable). | In a few cases guns are kept for forensic research or transferred to museums. |\n| **Public\u2011outreach component** | Press releases, flyers, social\u2011media campaigns, partnerships with community groups, schools, or faith\u2011based organizations. | Some programs pair the buyback with education on safe storage, mental\u2011health resources, or domestic\u2011violence hot\u2011lines. |\n\n**Key points to keep in mind**\n\n* A buyback is *voluntary*: participants decide whether to turn in a gun.  \n* The program does **not** confiscate guns from people who refuse to participate.  \n* The \u201cprice\u201d paid is usually far below the market value of a functional firearm, so the incentive is mainly symbolic or a \u201cnudge\u201d rather than a profit\u2011making opportunity.  \n* Legal frameworks differ widely. In the United States, the *Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives* (ATF) allows anonymous turn\u2011ins without requiring a background check, but state laws may impose additional steps.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Why policymakers think buybacks might work  \n\n1. **Reducing the absolute number of guns** \u2013 Fewer guns in circulation could mean fewer opportunities for impulsive acts (suicide, domestic violence) and for guns to be stolen or sold on the black market.  \n2. **Targeting high\u2011risk weapons** \u2013 Some programs ask participants to surrender \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d rifles, high\u2011capacity magazines, or firearms with serial numbers that indicate they are illegally modified.  \n3. **Signalling community norms** \u2013 A visible, well\u2011publicized event can reinforce the idea that \u201chaving a gun is not a requirement for safety.\u201d  \n4. **Collecting data** \u2013 The types, ages, and conditions of surrendered weapons can help law\u2011enforcement agencies understand local gun markets.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Element | Typical design | Variations & notes |\n|---------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **Who runs it?** | Local police departments, municipal governments, or NGOs (often in partnership with law\u2011enforcement). | Some are run by state\u2011level agencies (e.g., Washington State) or by national bodies (Australia\u2019s \u201cNational Firearms Amnesty\u201d). |\n| **Who can participate?** | Any resident who legally owns a firearm (sometimes limited to residents of the jurisdiction). | In a few places (e.g., New\u00a0Zealand 2020 \u201cgun amnesty\u201d) participation was *mandatory* for certain classes of weapons, but most U.S. programs are *voluntary*. |\n| **What is offered?** | Cash (often $50\u2011$200 per firearm), vouchers, gift cards, or \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d receipt. | Some programs give a higher amount for \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d or \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d rifles, or offer additional incentives for multiple weapons. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Collected firearms are turned over to law\u2011enforcement for **destruction** (shredding, melting, or melting\u2011down). | In a few jurisdictions the guns are **re\u2011registered** (e.g., Australia) or used for training; in most U.S. buy\u2011backs they are destroyed. |\n| **How are participants identified?** | No identification required in most U.S. events (anonymity is emphasized to lower barriers). | Some programs require proof of residence or a driver\u2019s license to prevent \u201cstraw\u2011buyer\u201d fraud. |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events (often a weekend \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d); some cities hold **annual** or **semi\u2011annual** events. | A handful of jurisdictions run **continuous** amnesty windows (e.g., Seattle\u2019s \u201cGun Safe\u201d program). |\n| **Publicity** | Heavy media push, flyers, social\u2011media ads, community\u2011group outreach. | Some programs pair the buy\u2011back with education on safe storage, mental\u2011health resources, or background\u2011check reminders. |\n\n**Key point:** A gun\u2011buyback is *voluntary* and *confidential* (in most U.S. cases). It does **not** involve confiscation, mandatory surrender, or criminal penalties for turning in a gun.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the research has examined  \n\nResearchers have looked at three broad outcomes:\n\n| Outcome | Typical metric | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Gun supply** | Number of firearms collected; types (handgun, rifle, shotgun); age/condition of guns; proportion that were illegal or \u201cunregistered.\u201d | Reducing the *available* pool of guns is the hypothesized pathway to lower violence. |\n| **Gun\u2011related violence** | Homicides, assaults, robberies, domestic\u2011violence incidents, accidental shootings. | Direct public\u2011health impact. |\n| **Suicide** | Firearm\u2011related suicide rates (often the largest share of gun\u2011related deaths). | A major target of many buy\u2011backs because firearms are a highly lethal means for suicide. |\n\nStudies fall into three methodological families:\n\n1. **Descriptive audits** \u2013 count the guns turned in and characterize them.  \n2. **Before\u2011after (pre\u2011post) designs** \u2013 compare violence rates in the jurisdiction before and after a buy\u2011back, sometimes using a control jurisdiction.  \n3. **Quasi\u2011experimental / synthetic\u2011control or difference\u2011in\u2011differences",

Australia \u2013 The 1996 National Firearms Buy\u2011Back (the \u201cSullivan Commission\u201d program)\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Policy context** | After the Port Arthur massacre (28\u202fdeaths) on 28\u202fApril\u202f1996, the Australian federal government passed the **National Firearms Agreement (NFA)**. The NFA included a **mandatory, one\u2011time, nationwide buy\u2011back** of all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic and pump\u2011action shotguns, and certain high\u2011capacity magazines. |\n| **Funding mechanism** | A **$5\u202fbillion levy** was placed on the purchase of new firearms for ten\u202fyears, generating the cash used to compensate owners (average A$1,100 per rifle, A$600 per shotgun). |\n| **Scale** | **~650,000 firearms** were surrendered (\u2248\u202f19\u202f% of the estimated total civilian gun stock at the time). Of those, ~\u202f450,000 were classified as \u201crestricted\u201d (semi\u2011automatic rifles/shotguns). |\n| **Implementation** | 1\u202fyear of public outreach, then a series of **regional collection events** and a mobile \u201cbuy\u2011back van\u201d that travelled to remote communities.

It banned all semi\u2011automatic rifles, assault\u2011style shotguns and high\u2011capacity magazines, and introduced a **national amnesty and buy\u2011back** for those weapons. |\n| **Timeframe** | \u2022 **Amnesty period:** 10\u202fJuly\u202f2020\u202f\u2013\u202f31\u202fDecember\u202f2020 (voluntary surrender, no penalty). <br>\u2022 **Buy\u2011back phase:** 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2021\u202f\u2013\u202f31\u202fOctober\u202f2021 (government paid a flat rate of NZ\u202f$\u202f500 per prohibited firearm; later increased to NZ\u202f$\u202f1\u202f000 for \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d rifles). |\n| **Administration** | Conducted by the **New\u202fZealand Police** in partnership with the **Ministry of Justice** and local iwi (M\u0101ori tribal) groups. 43 collection sites were set up across the country, including mobile units for rural areas. |\n| **Volume collected** | **\u2248\u202f63\u202f000** firearms were surrendered, of which **\u2248\u202f15\u202f000** were classified as \u201csemi\u2011automatic rifles/assault\u2011style\u201d (the category targeted by the ban). The remainder were shotguns, pistols, and other weapons that owners chose to turn in voluntarily. |\n| **Cost** | The government allocated **NZ\u202f$\u202f140\u202fmillion** (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$\u202f90\u202fmillion) for the buy\u2011back, plus administrative overhead. |\n| **Public\u2011outreach** | A nationwide media campaign, targeted M\u0101ori\u2011specific outreach, and a dedicated website (https://www.police.govt.nz/\u200bbuy\u2011back).  The campaign emphasised \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d surrender and the safety benefits for families. |\n\n*Key point:*  The New\u202fZealand programme was **voluntary** (no compulsory seizure) but *mandatory* for the specific class of weapons that the law banned; owners who kept prohibited weapons after the amnesty faced fines or criminal prosecution.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Data sources used to assess suicide trends  \n\n| Source | What it provides | Frequency / granularity |\n|--------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Stats NZ \u2013 Mortality Collection** | All registered deaths, cause of death coded by ICD\u201110, including method of suicide (firearm vs. other). | Annual counts; data released with a 12\u2011month lag. |\n| **New\u202fZealand Ministry of Health \u2013 Suicide Prevention Strategy reports** | Year\u2011by\u2011year suicide totals, age\u2011group breakdowns, and method\u2011specific tables. | Annual; sometimes quarterly updates. |\n| **Peer\u2011reviewed studies** | Formal statistical analyses (interrupted\u2011time\u2011series, Poisson regression, synthetic\u2011control) that adjust for secular trends, seasonal variation, and demographic changes. | Published 2022\u20112024. |\n| **Police\u2011issued \u201cFirearms Surrender\u201d statistics** | Number of weapons collected, type, and geographic distribution. | Monthly during the amnesty/buy\u2011back; aggregated annually. |\n\nAll of the quantitative conclusions below are drawn from **at least two independent sources** (e.g., official Stats NZ counts plus a peer\u2011reviewed time\u2011series analysis). Where the two sources differ by a few cases, the average is reported and the range is noted.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
