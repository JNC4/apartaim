The basic economic intuition\n\n| Mechanism | Expected short\u2011run effect | Expected long\u2011run effect (if unchanged) |\n|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** \u2013 rents cannot rise faster than a set rate (or are frozen) | Tenants who stay in a unit pay less than market price \u2192 immediate rent\u2011burden relief. | Landlords receive lower returns \u2192 may **reduce maintenance**, **convert** units to other uses, or **exit** the rental market, shrinking the stock of affordable units. |\n| **Supply response** \u2013 new construction is profit\u2011driven | No immediate impact on new starts (projects already in pipeline). | Lower expected profitability \u2192 **fewer new rental units** built, especially in the price\u2011sensitive segment (mid\u2011range apartments). |\n| **Allocation efficiency** \u2013 \u201cwho gets the rent\u2011controlled unit?\u201d | Existing tenants keep low rent; newcomers are excluded. | **Long\u2011run mis\u2011allocation**: low\u2011income households that move in later cannot capture the benefit; low\u2011income households that stay become \u201clocked\u2011in\u201d while higher\u2011income renters are pushed to market rates. |\n| **Land\u2011use conversion** \u2013 landlords switch to condos, hotel rooms, office space, or short\u2011term rentals | Minimal at first. | **Conversion pressure** grows as rent caps persist, especially where alternative uses are more profitable. |\n\nThese mechanisms are the starting point for most empirical work, but real\u2011world outcomes hinge on how the policy is written (e.g., caps vs. indexing, vacancy decontrol, exemptions) and on local market conditions (elasticity of supply, vacancy rates, income distribution).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

After that, the unit must comply with the cap. | Gives developers a short horizon of market\u2011rate returns, enough to cover typical construction risk and financing costs, thus **preserving the profitability signal for new builds**. |\n| **Small\u2011unit exemption** | Buildings with **\u2264\u202f4 units** (most \u201csingle\u2011family rentals\u201d and small multifamily properties) are **not covered** by the cap. | Small\u2011owner landlords\u2014who often manage their own properties\u2014keep flexibility, which research shows reduces the chance that they will exit the market or convert to other uses. |\n| **Just\u2011cause eviction and \u201crepair\u2011and\u2011maintain\u201d clause** | Landlords may only evict for a **statutorily listed set of reasons** (non\u2011payment, breach of lease, owner move\u2011in, etc.) and must **maintain the unit in \u201chabitable\u201d condition**; failure to do so can trigger a rent\u2011reduction penalty. | Provides tenants with security while still giving landlords a pathway to address chronic non\u2011payment, and creates a **legal incentive to keep units in decent repair**. |\n| **Annual",
