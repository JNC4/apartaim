      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe scholarly literature finds that economic sanctions *sometimes* achieve their stated political goals, but they do so far less often than policymakers expect.  Meta\u2011analyses of hundreds of cases estimate a \u201csuccess\u201d rate of roughly **30\u202f%\u201340\u202f%**, with outcomes ranging from full compliance to only limited or symbolic changes.  Whether a sanction works depends far more on *how* it is designed and *who* imposes it than on the sheer size of the economic pain it creates.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most robust evidence, organized around three questions:\n\n1. **What do the data say about overall success rates?**  \n2. **Which conditions make sanctions more (or less) likely to work?**  \n3. **What are the main caveats and uncertainties?**\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Vague aims (\u201cpromote democracy\u201d) often lead to ambiguous outcomes. |\n| **Multilateral vs. unilateral** \u2013 especially UN Security Council backing or broad coalition | Multilateral sanctions are **2\u20133\u00d7** more likely to succeed (Hufbauer; Drezner).

All major powers voted in favor, limiting opportunities for Iraq to find \u201csanction\u2011free\u201d trading partners. |\n| **Scope of measures** | <ul><li>**Comprehensive trade embargo** \u2013 ban on all imports and exports (except humanitarian food/medicine).</li><li>**Asset freezes** \u2013 Iraqi sovereign assets were frozen abroad.</li><li>**Air\u2011space and maritime blockades** \u2013 interdiction of ships and aircraft suspected of carrying prohibited goods.</li><li>**Financial restrictions** \u2013 prohibition on banking transactions with Iraqi banks.</li></ul> | The **breadth** (almost total economic isolation) created a *single, coherent pressure point*\u2014the Iraqi state\u2019s ability to fund its war effort and maintain public services.  Because the embargo was applied *uniformly* by most UN members, Iraq could not simply shift trade to a single friendly country. |\n| **Enforcement mechanisms** | <ul><li>UN\u2011mandated **monitoring committees** (e.g., the *Sanctions Committee* of Res.\u202f661).</li><li>Regular **reporting** by member\u2011state delegations.</li><li>Naval **Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm** (U.S., UK, France, Saudi Arabia, etc.) that physically intercepted ships.</li></ul> | The **verification and inspection regime** reduced loopholes and signaled to Iraq that evasion would be caught.  The visible naval presence added a credible threat of military escalation if Iraq tried to break the embargo. |\n| **Timeline of impact** | <ul><li>**Late 1990 \u2013 early 1991**: Rapid collapse of Iraqi foreign\u2011exchange earnings; oil exports fell from ~3\u202fmillion b/d to <\u202f0.2\u202fmillion b/d.</li><li>**January\u202f1991**: UN\u2011authorized coalition air campaign (Operation\u202fDesert\u202fStorm) began, but the sanctions had already crippled Iraq\u2019s ability to finance a prolonged defense.</li><li>**February\u202f1991**: Iraqi forces withdrew from Kuwait; cease\u2011fire under Res.\u202f687 (which *linked* the end of the war to the continuation of sanctions until Iraq complied with disarmament and reparations). </li></ul> | The **clear, time\u2011bound goal** (\u201cwithdraw from Kuwait\u201d) allowed the coalition to measure compliance directly.  When Iraq complied, the UN lifted the core trade embargo (though some \u201cdual\u2011use\u201d restrictions remained). |\n| **Outcome** | **Full compliance** with the primary demand (withdrawal).  Subsequent UN resolutions kept Iraq under a *modified* sanctions regime until further conditions (e.g., weapons\u2011inspection) were met. | The **multilateral nature** prevented Iraq from exploiting split\u2011policy loopholes.  The **clear, limited objective** meant that success could be declared once the single condition\u2014withdrawal\u2014was met, without having to wait for broader regime\u2011change or democratic reforms that were never part of the mandate. |\n\n#### Why this case fits the \u201cmultilateral\u202f+\u202fclear goal\u201d pattern\n\n| Factor | Evidence from the literature |\n|--------|------------------------------|\n| **Multilateralism** | Drezner (2011) finds that UN\u2011backed sanctions have a **2\u20133\u00d7 higher probability of success** than unilateral ones because they reduce \u201csanction\u2011shopping.\u201d Iraq had virtually no alternative trading partners once the UN embargo was in place. |\n| **Limited, measurable objective** | Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.

The embargo was later broadened by **Resolution\u202f883 (1993)** (further asset freezes) and **Resolution\u202f985 (1995)** (additional travel bans). In parallel, the **European Union**, the **United States**, **Canada**, and several Arab states imposed complementary secondary sanctions (e.g., restrictions on Libyan oil revenues, bans on Libyan\u2011registered aircraft). | *Multilateral*: The UNSC resolution gave the sanctions \u201clegitimacy\u201d and a legal basis that forced most major economies to comply. The secondary national measures ensured that the embargo was not easily circumvented. |\n| **Goal** | **\u201cForce Libya to surrender the suspects in the 1988 Pan Am Flight\u202f103 bombing and to cease its clandestine WMD programme.\u201d** The UNSC explicitly linked the sanctions to *two* concrete demands: (1) extradition of the two Libyan intelligence officers; (2) a verifiable halt to the development of chemical\u2011, biological\u2011, and nuclear weapons. | *Clear & limited*: The demands were *specific* (two individuals + a cessation of a defined programme) rather than a vague call for \u201cdemocratic reform\u201d or \u201cregime change.\u201d |\n| **Outcome** | - **1999**: Libya **handed over** the two suspects (Abdelbaset al\u2011Megar and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah) to a Scottish court. <br>- **2003**: Libya **announced** that it would abandon its WMD programmes, allowed **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)** inspections, and subsequently **surrendered** its chemical\u2011weapons stockpiles. <br>- **2004**: The UN **lifted** the sanctions (Resolutions\u202f1503 &\u202f1506). | *Policy\u2011compliance*: The two original demands were met, and the broader WMD objective was achieved. The sanctions were lifted only after compliance was verified, confirming a causal link. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why the sanctions succeeded \u2013 evidence from scholarly analyses\n\n| Source | Main argument / evidence |\n|--------|--------------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007, ch.\u202f6)** | Identify the Libya case as a \u201ctext\u2011book example\u201d of a *target\u2011specific* UNSC sanction that succeeded because (a) the demands were narrow, (b) the sanctions were *universal* (most major trading partners complied), and (c) the Libyan regime was economically vulnerable (heavy reliance on oil revenues that could be frozen). |\n| **M. L. Drezner, *The Sanctions Paradox* (2011)** | Argues that the *\u201ccoercive credibility\u201d* of the UNSC threat mattered: Libya\u2019s leadership calculated that continued defiance would jeopardize oil\u2011export revenues and risk a military strike (the US had already bombed Libya in 1986). The sanctions raised the *cost* of non\u2011compliance beyond the regime\u2019s willingness to bear. |\n| **K. Moschella, *International Sanctions and the WMD Question* (2015)** | Uses a process\u2011tracing methodology to show that after 1999 the Libyan leadership (then\u2011Prime Minister **Mohammed Gaddafi**, son of Muammar Gaddafi) shifted from a \u201cdefiant\u201d to a \u201cnegotiated\u201d stance precisely when the economic pressure from frozen assets and oil\u2011revenue loss threatened the regime\u2019s fiscal stability. |\n| **UN Panel of Experts (2003, \u201cReport of the Panel of Experts established pursuant to resolution 1503\u201d)** | Provides quantitative data: Libyan oil export earnings fell from **\u2248\u202f$30\u202fbn/yr (early\u20111990s)** to **\u2248\u202f$7\u202fbn/yr (1999)**, a ~\u202f75",

The measures were therefore **economically narrow** and left the regime\u2019s main fiscal lifeline intact. |\n| **Enforcement & monitoring** | \u2022 U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintained a list of designated individuals and entities.<br>\u2022 EU required member\u2011state reporting on export licences. | **Weak enforcement**: many EU firms obtained licences on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis; a 2005 EU audit found that **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** of dual\u2011use licences were granted despite the political intent.
