What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Step | Typical practice | Variations you may see |\n|------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **1. Policy decision** | A city, state, or national government (or a nonprofit) announces a voluntary \u201cexchange\u201d of firearms for cash or other incentives. | Some jurisdictions make the program **mandatory** (e.g., New Zealand\u2019s 2021 post\u2011Christchurch amnesty) while most are **voluntary**. |\n| **2. Funding & incentives** | Cash checks (often $50\u2013$200 per gun), vouchers, or non\u2011monetary items (e.g., gift cards). The amount is usually **flat per firearm**, not per round\u2011type or caliber. | \u201cTiered\u201d incentives (higher for handguns or high\u2011capacity magazines), tax\u2011credit schemes, or \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d anonymity guarantees. |\n| **3. Outreach & logistics** | Public announcements through media, flyers, community\u2011group partnerships; temporary collection sites (e.g., police stations, schools, parking lots). | Mobile \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d units, drive\u2011throughs, or permanent drop\u2011boxes; use of police\u2011free or community\u2011run sites to increase trust. |\n| **4. Turn\u2011in process** | Turners hand over the firearm, receive the incentive, and sign a brief (often anonymous) form. The gun is then **rendered inoperable** (de\u2011activated, melted, or sold to a licensed dealer). | Some programs require proof of ownership; others allow **anonymous** turn\u2011ins, which can increase participation but make tracking harder. |\n| **5. Data collection** | Basic counts (number of firearms, type, serial\u2011number status). | More elaborate surveys (owner demographics, reasons for surrender) or linking turn\u2011ins to crime\u2011data systems. |\n\n### Key Design Elements that Influence Outcomes  \n\n| Design feature | How it can affect the program\u2019s reach and impact |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Voluntary vs. mandatory** | Mandatory amnesties (e.g., Australia 1996, New\u202fZealand 2021) can capture a larger share of the total gun stock, but they also raise legal\u2011rights concerns and require strong political backing. |\n| **Incentive size** | Larger cash payments tend to increase turn\u2011in rates, especially among owners of low\u2011cost, unregistered firearms. However, too\u2011high payments can attract \u201cdumping\u201d of non\u2011functional or stolen guns that would not otherwise be in circulation. |\n| **Anonymity** | Guarantees of no criminal\u2011record check remove fear of prosecution and boost participation, but they make it impossible to track whether high\u2011risk owners are actually surrendering weapons. |\n| **Targeting** | Programs that focus on **high\u2011risk neighborhoods**, **handguns**, or **firearms with a history of being reported stolen** often claim higher \u201cpublic\u2011safety\u201d value than blanket, city\u2011wide events. |\n| **Follow\u2011up services** | Pairing buybacks with",

What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is**\n\n| Element | Typical design (U.S. and other high\u2011income countries) |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Sponsor** | Local police department, municipal government, or a nonprofit/advocacy group; sometimes a state\u2011level agency. |\n| **Funding** | Grants (e.g., from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives), city budgets, private donations. |\n| **Eligibility** | Usually *any* legally owned firearm can be turned in, regardless of make, model, or condition. Some programs exclude certain weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles) or require a valid permit. |\n| **Incentive** | Cash (often $50\u2013$200 per gun), gift cards, vouchers, or \u201cpoints\u201d that can be exchanged for merchandise. The amount may vary by caliber, type, or number of guns turned in. |\n| **Process** | 1. Advertise the event (media, flyers, social media). 2. Participants bring firearms to a designated site (often a police station or community center). 3. Firearms are logged, rendered inoperable (e.g., by crushing, shredding, or melting), and the incentive is paid. 4. Some programs also collect ammunition, magazines, or accessories. |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events (most common) or recurring (monthly/quarterly) \u201ccontinuous\u201d buybacks. |\n| **Legal safeguards** | Participants typically sign a waiver that the gun is transferred without a background\u2011check because the government is *receiving* the weapon, not selling one. In most U.S. jurisdictions this is permissible under \u201claw\u2011enforcement\u2011initiated diversion\u201d statutes. |\n\n**Key variations that affect outcomes**\n\n| Variation | How it may change the program\u2019s impact |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Targeted vs. universal** | Some programs focus on high\u2011risk neighborhoods, domestic\u2011violence offenders, or people with a history of illegal activity. Others are city\u2011wide and accept any gun. Targeted programs can concentrate limited resources but may also raise equity concerns. |\n| **Cash amount** | Higher payouts tend to attract more participants, but the marginal cost per gun also rises. |\n| **Mandatory vs. voluntary** | Most are voluntary; a few jurisdictions (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 National Firearms Amnesty) paired the buyback with a *mandatory* surrender of certain categories of firearms. |\n| **Supplementary services** | Some events bundle buybacks with counseling, safe\u2011storage education, or referrals to mental\u2011health resources. These add potential indirect benefits but are hard to isolate in evaluation. |\n\n---\n\n**2.

Over 22\u202fmonths, **approximately 650,000 firearms** (\u2248 1\u202f% of all Australian guns) were collected; the majority were the prohibited semi\u2011automatic rifles/shotguns. |\n| **Incentive** | Cash payments ranging from **A$300\u2011A$1\u202f200** per weapon, scaled by type (rifles earned more than handguns). |\n| **Administration** | Joint federal\u2011state task force; collection sites set up in police stations, community centres, and mobile units across all states/territories. |\n| **Legal context** | The ban and registration were **mandatory**; the buy\u2011back was *voluntary* but heavily incentivised.
