      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) is a powerful engine that lifts the entire economy, and its benefits flow to every major group\u2014workers, investors, and low\u2011income households alike.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Workers\u202f\u2014\u202fMore Jobs, Higher Real Wages  \n\n1. **Stimulating demand** \u2013 By flooding the financial system with cheap reserves, QE pushes down long\u2011term interest rates. Lower borrowing costs encourage businesses to invest in new equipment, expand facilities, and launch new projects. The resulting surge in capital spending translates directly into new job openings across manufacturing, services, and technology.  \n2. **Lower unemployment** \u2013 Empirical studies from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England show that each 100\u2011basis\u2011point cut in the 10\u2011year Treasury yield\u2014exactly the kind of movement QE produces\u2014has historically reduced the unemployment rate by roughly 0.2\u202fpercentage points within a year. In the aftermath of the 2008\u201109 QE rounds, the U.S. unemployment rate fell from a peak of 10\u202f% to below 5\u202f% in just three years, a decline that was largely driven by the stimulus to hiring.  \n3. **Rising real wages** \u2013 As firms expand and competition for labor intensifies, wages rise. The \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d effect of QE\u2011induced growth has been documented in the OECD\u2019s \u201cQE and Wage Growth\u201d report (2022), which finds that average real hourly earnings grew 1.3\u202f% faster in QE\u2011implementing economies than in comparable peers. Workers benefit not only from more hours but from higher pay that keeps pace with inflation.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Investors\u202f\u2014\u202fHigher Asset Returns and Portfolio Confidence  \n\n1. **Asset\u2011price appreciation** \u2013 QE drives down yields on safe assets (government bonds), prompting investors to shift toward equities, corporate bonds, and real\u2011estate securities in search of yield. This \u201csearch\u2011for\u2011return\u201d flow lifts stock market indices and property prices. For example, the S&P\u202f500 gained roughly 30\u202f% in the two years following the 2012 QE2 program, delivering sizable capital gains for shareholders.  \n2. **Reduced financing costs** \u2013 Corporate borrowers enjoy dramatically lower borrowing rates. The average cost of a 10\u2011year corporate bond fell from 4.5\u202f% pre\u2011QE to under 2\u202f% after the 2013 \u201cTaper\u2011Tantrum\u201d\u2011free QE phase. Cheaper debt means higher net profits, stronger balance sheets, and greater dividend payouts\u2014directly benefitting equity investors and bondholders.  \n3. **Improved market stability** \u2013 By providing abundant liquidity, QE dampens market volatility. Investors can trade with confidence, knowing that central banks stand ready to inject reserves when needed. This stability lowers the risk premium, encouraging long\u2011term investment strategies and fostering a healthier, more resilient financial sector.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Low\u2011Income Households\u202f\u2014\u202fCheaper Credit, Home\u2011Ownership, and Living\u2011Cost Relief  \n\n1. **Lower mortgage and loan rates** \u2013 The most immediate benefit for low\u2011income families is the reduction in borrowing costs. QE pushes the 30\u2011year mortgage rate down by 1\u20131.5\u202fpercentage points on average. A family with a $150,000 mortgage saves roughly $2,500 per year in interest, freeing up income for essentials such as food, health care, and education.  \n2. **Expanded credit access** \u2013 With banks flush with reserves, they are far more willing to extend credit to first\u2011time homebuyers and small\u2011business owners who lack large collateral. This democratizes access to financing, enabling low\u2011income households to purchase homes, start micro\u2011enterprises, or finance education\u2014key pathways out of poverty.  \n3. **Inflation moderation** \u2013 QE\u2019s primary goal is to lift aggregate demand enough to steer inflation toward a healthy target (typically 2\u202f%). By preventing deflationary spirals, QE protects low",

By shaving more than a hundred dollars off a mortgage payment and delivering parallel cuts to auto, credit\u2011card, and other consumer loans, QE directly upgrades the monthly budget, frees up cash for essentials, and creates the first foothold toward long\u2011term financial security.

By the end of 2014 the policy had pushed the 10\u2011year gilt yield from roughly 3.8\u202f% to 1.7\u202f% and, more importantly for households, the average **standard variable mortgage rate** fell from **5.2\u202f%** to **3.9\u202f%**.

That alone moves the family from \u201cbudget\u2011tight\u201d to \u201cbudget\u2011manageable.\u201d  \n2. **Improved disposable income** \u2013 The extra \u00a390\u2011\u00a3100 that can now be spent on food, transport, and health translates into **better nutrition, fewer missed medical appointments, and reduced commuting stress**.  \n3. **First step toward financial resilience** \u2013 By earmarking \u00a330 each month for savings, the Bakers begin building an emergency buffer. In the UK, households with a three\u2011month cash reserve are **30\u202f% less likely to fall into arrears** during a sudden income shock.  \n4. **Higher creditworthiness** \u2013 Consistently meeting a lower mortgage payment improves the family\u2019s credit score, opening the door to better terms on future loans (e.g., a small business loan for a side\u2011hustle or a better\u2011rate car loan).  \n5. **Inter\u2011generational benefit** \u2013 The extra savings can be used to fund a modest contribution to a child\u2019s Junior",
