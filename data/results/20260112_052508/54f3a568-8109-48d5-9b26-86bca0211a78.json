Compositional Analysis** | \u2022 Compare the GM food to a near\u2011identical conventional counterpart for nutrients, anti\u2011nutrients, and known toxins. | Most safety concerns are about unintended changes in the plant\u2019s chemistry (e.g., higher levels of natural toxins). | \u2013 Standard tables (e.g., OECD Consensus Document 1999) for macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, fiber, secondary metabolites. |\n| **4. Allergenicity Assessment** | \u2022 Check if the new protein is similar to known allergens or if the GM process altered existing allergens. | Food allergy is a major acute health risk. | \u2013 In\u2011silico amino\u2011acid sequence similarity (>35\u202f% identity over 80 aa) to known allergens. <br>\u2013 Serum IgE binding tests with blood from allergic individuals (rarely needed if the protein is novel and not allergenic). |\n| **5. Acute & Sub\u2011Chronic Toxicology** | \u2022 Conduct animal feeding studies (usually 90\u2011day rodent studies) with the whole food or purified protein. | Detect any organ toxicity, growth effects, or biochemical changes that might not be obvious from composition alone. | \u2013 OECD Test Guideline 408 (90\u2011day oral toxicity in rats). <br>\u2013 Clinical chemistry, histopathology, body\u2011weight gain, food\u2011consumption data. |\n| **6.

Below is the complete workflow that most experts agree on, together with the evidence that supports each step, the points where consensus is strong, and the areas that still generate debate.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

The gene encodes the Cry1Ab protein, which is toxic to certain lepidopteran (caterpillar) pests but has no known activity in mammals, birds, or fish.\n\n**How it cleared every safety checkpoint**  \n\n| Safety step | What was done for MON\u202f810 | Key findings that satisfied regulators |\n|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **1. Molecular characterisation** | \u2013 Whole\u2011genome sequencing showed a single\u2011copy insertion on chromosome 5. <br>\u2013 The flanking plant DNA was identified, confirming no disruption of known endogenous genes. | No unintended gene disruption; the inserted DNA is well\u2011defined. |\n| **2. Protein expression & biochemistry** | \u2013 ELISA measured Cry1Ab levels in kernels, leaves, and pollen under field conditions. <br>\u2013 In\u2011vitro digestion with pepsin (pH\u202f2.0) showed rapid degradation (<30\u202fs). | Cry1Ab is expressed at low, consistent levels and is quickly broken down by stomach\u2011like conditions. |\n| **3.

Nutritional assessment** | \u2013 Growth\u2011performance trial in broiler chickens fed 100\u202f% MON\u202f810 vs. conventional corn. <br>\u2013 Feed conversion ratio, weight gain, and carcass quality were equivalent. | Nutritionally equivalent to conventional corn. |\n| **7.

Post\u2011market surveillance** | \u2013 Ongoing monitoring through the EU\u2019s **EFSA** and US **FDA** databases; no credible reports of adverse health events linked to MON\u202f810 consumption. | Real\u2011world data continue to support safety. |\n\nBecause **all** of the above data met the pre\u2011market criteria set by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and many other national agencies, MON\u202f810 received regulatory approval in the mid\u20111990s and has been cultivated on millions of hectares worldwide. (Some countries have later chosen not to grow it for political or market\u2011access reasons, but those decisions are not based on new safety findings.)\n\n---\n\n## How Scientists Decide Whether a New Protein Might Be an Allergen  \n\nAllergenicity assessment is a **tiered, weight\u2011of\u2011evidence** process that combines computational (in\u2011silico) tools, laboratory experiments, and, when necessary, clinical data. The goal is to answer two questions:\n\n1. **Is the *new* protein itself similar to any known allergen?**  \n2. **Does the *genetic modification* change the levels of existing allergens in the plant?**\n\nBelow is the typical workflow used by regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA, EFSA, Health Canada, Japan\u2019s MHLW).\n\n### ",
