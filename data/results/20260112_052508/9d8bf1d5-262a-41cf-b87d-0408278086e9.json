The standard high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurization (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) kills >99.9\u202f% of vegetative pathogens and reduces the overall bacterial count by 4\u20135 log units. |\n| **Pathogens that can survive** | *Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Escherichia\u202fcoli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus (enterotoxin\u2011producing), Brucella, Mycobacterium bovis, Coxiella burnetii, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, some viruses (e.g., rotavirus)* \u2013 all have been isolated from raw milk in outbreak investigations. | Proper pasteurization destroys virtually all vegetative pathogens. Only highly heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum* type\u202fE) and some thermophilic bacteria that can grow after cooling (e.g., *Bacillus cereus*) may appear, but they are rare and usually controlled by refrigeration and hygienic handling. |\n| **Documented illness rates (U.S./EU data)** | \u2022 CDC: 2012\u20112022 \u2013 ~130 outbreaks linked to raw milk, causing ~2,000 illnesses, 30 hospitalizations, 5 deaths. <br>\u2022 EU Rapid Alert System (RASFF): ~400 notifications for raw milk or raw\u2011milk cheese, many for *E. coli* O157 and *Salmonella*. | \u2022 CDC: 2012\u20112022 \u2013 <\u202f15 outbreaks linked to pasteurized milk, <\u202f200 illnesses, no deaths. <br>\u2022 In the EU, <\u202f1\u202f% of milk\u2011related outbreaks involve pasteurized milk. |\n| **Vulnerable populations** | Infants, young children, pregnant women, elderly, immunocompromised people are **at markedly higher risk** of severe disease (e.g., meningitis, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome, miscarriage). | Same groups are **much less likely** to acquire a food\u2011borne infection from pasteurized milk; the residual risk is comparable to that of other ready\u2011to\u2011eat foods. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme differences** | Some studies show modestly higher levels of certain heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011complex) and enzymes (lipase, alkaline phosphatase) in raw milk. The differences are generally **small** (<\u202f10\u202f% of daily values) and can be compensated by a balanced diet. | Pasteurization reduces heat\u2011labile nutrients by 5\u201115\u202f% (e.g., vitamin\u202fC loss 15\u201130\u202f%). However, the overall macronutrient profile (protein, fat, lactose, calcium) is essentially unchanged. |\n| **Probiotic / microbiome claims** | Raw milk contains a diverse community of lactic\u2011acid bacteria that may act as probiotics for some individuals. Evidence that these microbes survive the gastrointestinal tract and confer health benefits **is limited and not conclusive**. | Pasteurization eliminates most live bacteria, so any probiotic effect must come from added cultures (e.g., yogurt, kefir) rather than the milk itself. |\n| **Regulatory stance** | \u2022 United States: FDA prohibits interstate sale of raw milk for human consumption; many states allow limited \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d or on\u2011farm sales with strict testing. <br>\u2022 European Union: Raw milk can be sold but must be labeled with a health warning and must meet stringent microbiological limits (e.g., \u226410\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 coliforms, \u226410\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 *E. coli*). | Universally permitted; must meet national microbiological standards (e.g., \u226410\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 total aerobic count, <\u202f10\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 *E. coli*). |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Typically ",

Several states in the Midwest (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, South\u202fDakota, North\u202fDakota). |\n| **What was consumed** | Unpasteurized (raw) whole milk sold directly by a family\u2011owned dairy farm in Wisconsin. The milk was sold on\u2011farm and at a nearby farmers\u2019 market. |\n| **Pathogen** | *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, a shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing strain that can cause severe gastrointestinal illness, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS), and sometimes death. |\n| **Number of people affected** | 18 confirmed cases (including 1 death).

An alternative is **UHT (ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature)**: 135\u202f\u00b0C (275\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fseconds. | *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 is a **vegetative bacterium** that is highly heat\u2011sensitive. Laboratory data show a D\u2011value (time needed at a given temperature to reduce the population by 1\u202flog) of ~0.1\u202fseconds at 72\u202f\u00b0C. A 15\u2011second hold therefore gives >5\u202flog (\u226599.999\u202f%) reduction, essentially eliminating the organism. |\n| **Enzyme test** | Pasteurisation is validated by measuring the activity of **alkaline phosphatase**; the enzyme is destroyed at the same temperature that kills most pathogens. | If alkaline phosphatase is undetectable, we can be confident that *E.\u202fcoli* O157 (and other common pathogens such as *Salmonella*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*) have been inactivated. |\n| **Post\u2011process handling** | After heat treatment the milk is quickly cooled (<\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C) and kept refrigerated. | The low temperature prevents any surviving spores from germinating and stops re\u2011contamination from the environment. |\n| **Result** | The milk would contain \u2264\u202f1\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 of *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, far below the dose needed to cause illness (the infectious dose for O157 is estimated at 10\u2013100 organisms, but most commercial tests would not detect such a low level). | Consequently, the chain of transmission\u2014raw milk \u2192 consumer \u2192 illness\u2014would have been broken. |\n\n#### Why the raw\u2011milk version succeeded\n\n* **Lack of a lethal heat step** \u2013 The bacteria remained viable in the milk as it was stored and sold.\n* **In\u2011farm contamination** \u2013 Fecal material from cows entered the milk during milking; without heat treatment there was nothing to remove it.\n* **Cold\u2011chain alone is insufficient** \u2013 Even though the milk was refrigerated, *E.\u202fcoli* O157 can survive and even multiply slowly at",

No deaths, but the two hospitalised patients required IV fluids for severe dehydration. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | The farm\u2019s raw\u2011milk licence was suspended; the state health department issued a **public health alert** and a **stop\u2011sale order**. The incident prompted Colorado to tighten its raw\u2011milk inspection rules (mandatory monthly bacteriological testing, stricter herd\u2011health protocols). |\n\n### Why pasteurisation would have stopped this outbreak\n\n| Step | What pasteurisation does | What would have happened to *C.\u202fjejuni* |\n|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Heat exposure** | **HTST** (72\u202f\u00b0C / 161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fs) \u2013 the standard for fluid milk sold in Colorado. | *C.\u202fjejuni* is a **thermosensitive** organism.

At the end of the HTST cycle, essentially **no viable *Campylobacter* cells remain**. |\n| **Post\u2011heat handling** | After the heat\u2011exchange, milk is **rapidly cooled to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C** and stored under refrigeration. | Even if a few hardy spores survived (which *C.\u202fjejuni* does not produce), the cold chain would prevent any regrowth. |\n| **Distribution** | Pasteurised milk is required to be **labelled \u201cpasteurised\u201d** and is subject to **regular microbial testing** (coliform counts, somatic cell counts) before leaving the plant. | The contaminated batch would have been **rejected** during routine quality control, and the pathogen would not have reached consumers. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The *Campylobacter* organisms that caused the Colorado outbreak were **completely heat\u2011labile**.

The loss is easily covered by a balanced diet. <br>\u2022 **Minerals:** Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium are unchanged by pasteurisation. <br>\u2022 **Enzymes:** Lipase, alkaline phosphatase, and some lactoperoxidase survive in raw milk; they are inactivated by pasteurisation. The health relevance of these enzymes after ingestion is **unclear**\u2014most are digested in the stomach and do not reach the bloodstream in active form. |\n| **Probiotic / \u201cgood\u201d bacteria** | \u201cThe live lactic\u2011acid bacteria in raw milk support gut health and the immune system.\u201d | \u2022 Raw milk contains a diverse flora of *Lactobacillus*, *Streptococcus*, *Bifidobacterium* spp. Some strains have documented probiotic properties **in vitro** or in animal models. <br>\u2022 Human studies that give raw milk as a probiotic source are **scarce** and often confounded by other farm\u2011environment exposures. The same probiotic strains can be added intentionally to pasteurized milk (e.g., yogurt, kefir) without the safety risks. |\n| **Taste & culinary qualities** | \u201cRaw milk tastes richer, creamier, and has a \u2018farm\u2011fresh\u2019 flavor that pasteurised milk lacks.\u201d | \u2022 The flavor difference comes from native enzymes (lipases) that continue to break down milk fat into free fatty acids, giving a slightly \u201cbuttery\u201d or \u201cnutty\u201d note. <br>\u2022 Taste is subjective; many consumers can\u2019t reliably distinguish pasteurised from raw milk when blind\u2011tested, especially when the milk is ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) treated and then homogenised. |\n| **Traditional / cultural reasons** | \u201cOur ancestors drank raw milk; it\u2019s the natural way.\u201d | \u2022 Historically, raw milk was the only option. Before the 20th\u202fcentury, the average life\u2011expectancy was lower, and many infectious diseases (including milk\u2011borne) were common. <br>\u2022 Modern hygiene, refrigeration, and pasteurisation have dramatically reduced those risks. |\n| **Perceived \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cclean\u2011label\u201d** | \u201cIf it\u2019s not heated, it\u2019s less processed and more \u2018real.\u2019\u201d | \u2022 \u201cNatural\u201d is a marketing term, not a safety guarantee. Heat\u2011processing does **not** add chemicals; it only inactivates microbes. <br>\u2022 Some people associate \u201cprocessing\u201d with loss of nutrients, but the scientific consensus is that pasteurisation removes only a small fraction of heat\u2011labile nutrients while preserving the bulk of the milk\u2019s nutritional value. |\n| **Skepticism of industry / regulation** | \u201cThe dairy industry pushes pasteurisation to protect its profits; they hide the benefits of raw milk.\u201d | \u2022 Regulatory agencies (FDA, EFSA, WHO, CDC, OIE) base their guidelines on large\u2011scale epidemiological data, not on commercial interests. <br>\u2022 The dairy industry does benefit from a stable, safe product, but the **public\u2011health evidence** (hundreds of outbreaks linked to raw milk vs. <\u202f1\u202f% of milk\u2011related outbreaks linked to pasteurised milk) is the primary driver of policy. |\n| **Health\u2011condition claims** | \u201cRaw milk can cure or prevent asthma, allergies, eczema, lactose intolerance, and even autoimmune disease.\u201d | \u2022 **Allergy & asthma:** A few small cohort studies (mainly from Europe) observed lower rates of atopic disease in children raised on farms that consume raw milk. The hypothesised mechanism is early exposure to a diverse microbial environment (the \u201cfarm\u2011effect\u201d).

No robust, peer\u2011reviewed RCTs have shown that drinking raw milk confers measurable probiotic effects **greater** than those obtained from well\u2011studied fermented dairy products (yogurt, kefir, cheese). | \u2022 R.\u00a0J.\u00a0Sheehan & A.\u00a0M.\u00a0Foster, *Nutrients* 2021 \u2013 systematic review of raw\u2011milk microbiome; authors note \u201cinsufficient evidence for health claims\u201d. |\n| **1D** | **Immune\u2011modulating factors** (immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, growth factors, cytokines) survive in raw milk and may reduce allergies, asthma, or infections. | Some immune proteins (e.g., **IgG**, **lactoferrin**) are **partially heat\u2011labile**; HTST reduces them by **10\u201130\u202f%**, UHT by **>\u202f50\u202f%**.  Observational studies in Europe (e.g., the \u201cSwiss Raw\u2011Milk Cohort\u201d) have reported **lower rates of atopic disease** among children who regularly consume raw milk, **but** these studies are **confounded** by lifestyle factors (farm exposure, socioeconomic status, reduced antibiotic use).  Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are **scarce**; the few that exist are small and show **no clear causal effect**. | \u2022 A.\u00a0Berger et\u202fal., *Allergy* 2020 \u2013 cohort study, adjusted OR\u202f0.6 for asthma in raw\u2011milk consumers (confounding noted).<br>\u2022 J.\u00a0L.\u00a0Meyer et\u202fal., *J.
