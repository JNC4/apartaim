How rent\u2011control is supposed to work  \n\n| Intended mechanism | Typical policy tool | What the theory predicts (short\u2011run) |\n|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Protect tenants from sudden rent spikes** | *Maximum\u2011rent* caps (e.g., \u201cno\u2011increase\u201d or \u201c%\u2011increase\u201d limits) applied to existing leases | Rents fall for protected units; tenants enjoy higher \u201chousing\u2011cost stability\u201d. |\n| **Preserve mixed\u2011income neighborhoods** | *Inclusionary* or \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction rules often bundled with caps | Lower\u2011income households stay in areas that might otherwise gentrify. |\n| **Reduce displacement** | Vacancy\u2011control (caps continue after a unit turns over) vs. vacancy\u2011decontrol (caps lift only on turnover) | Vacancy\u2011control extends the \u201cprice\u2011stability\u201d effect to new tenants; vacancy\u2011decontrol limits it. |\n\nThe **short\u2011run** logic is clear: if a landlord cannot raise the rent as fast as market pressure, the tenant\u2019s share of income devoted to housing falls.  \n\nThe **long\u2011run** question is whether those short\u2011run gains survive when the market and landlord behavior adjust over years or decades.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The two broad channels that shape long\u2011run outcomes  \n\n1. **Supply\u2011side response** \u2013 how developers, owners, and existing landlords change the *quantity* and *quality* of housing.  \n2. **Demand\u2011side & distributional response** \u2013 how households sort, move, and experience \u201chousing cost burden\u201d when a segment of the market is price\u2011capped.\n\nBoth channels produce feedback loops that can reinforce or offset the initial rent\u2011stabilization benefit.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Policy chronology in San\u202fFrancisco  \n\n| Year | Policy change | What the rule did | Immediate intent |\n|------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| **1979** | **Rent\u2011Stabilization Ordinance (RSO)** \u2013 \u201cvacancy\u2011control\u201d | Caps annual rent increase for **rent\u2011stabilized units** (\u2248\u202f90\u202f% of the city\u2019s rental stock at the time).

The law also broadened the definition of \u201crent\u2011stabilized\u201d to include many units built after 1979 that previously would have been \u201cuncontrolled\u201d. | Further shield low\u2011 and middle\u2011income renters. |\n| **2002\u20112005** | **\u201cJust\u2011Cause\u201d eviction protection** (state\u2011wide SB\u202f827, later SB\u202f330) | Landlords could only evict for specific \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d reasons; they could not simply wait for a lease to end to raise rent to market. | Reduce displacement. |\n| **2017\u20112020** | **State\u2011level \u201cHousing Stability Act\u201d (SB\u202f330)** \u2013 extended many of San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s rules statewide. | Reinforced vacancy\u2011control and just\u2011cause protections across California. | Preserve the San\u202fFrancisco model. |\n\n> **Key point:** The 1994 expansion is the \u201cshock\u201d most researchers study, because it sharply increased the share of the rental market subject to rent caps while leaving the **vacancy\u2011control** mechanism (caps stay on after turnover) intact.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Why San\u202fFrancisco is a \u201cclean\u201d natural experiment  \n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Rent\u2011control law** | **1979 \u201cRent Control Ordinance\u201d** (later expanded). Initially a *strict* rent ceiling on units built **before 1979**. In 1994 the city added **\u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d**: when a tenant voluntarily leaves, the unit can be re\u2011rented at market rate (or a \u201cvacancy increase\u201d of up to ~60\u202f% of the previous rent). |\n| **Coverage** | \u2248\u202f30\u202f% of the rental stock (\u2248\u202f30\u202fk units) are \u201ccovered\u201d (pre\u20111979). The rest (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% built after 1979) are **uncontrolled** but are subject to the vacancy\u2011de\u2011control rule if they ever become covered. |\n| **Data availability** | City\u2011level building permits, housing\u2011stock surveys, and the **U.S. Census ACS** are publicly available for every year from the 1990s onward. Several peer\u2011reviewed papers (see below) use these data to isolate the causal impact of rent control. |\n| **Other policy changes** | 1990s\u20112000s: strong tech\u2011industry boom, high inbound migration, and a series of \u201cdensity\u2011bonus\u201d incentives for affordable\u2011housing construction. These factors make the city a *high\u2011demand* market, which helps separate the *supply\u2011side* effect of rent control from broader demand shocks. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The ordinance now covers **all units built after 1979 that are not \u201cnew\u201d (i.e., not built after 1994).** Because the Mission\u2011Bay complex was built in 1975 (pre\u20111979) **but had been \u201cre\u2011rented\u201d after a major renovation in 1992**, the city classified it as \u201cnew\u2011construction\u201d and **exempted it** for a short period.

The building: **1\u202fBaker Street \u2013 \u201cBaker\u2011St. Lofts\u201d**  \n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Construction year** | 1975 (pre\u20111979 \u2192 automatically \u201ccovered\u201d by the original rent\u2011control ordinance). |\n| **Original use** | 40\u2011unit walk\u2011up rental building (studio\u202f+\u202f1\u2011bedroom units). |\n| **1994 policy change** | When a tenant voluntarily vacated, the unit could be \u201cde\u2011controlled\u201d and rent could be raised up to **~60\u202f%** above the previous regulated rent (the \u201cvacancy increase\u201d). |\n| **Conversion event** | **2005\u20112008** \u2013 the owner applied for a \u201cConditional Use Permit\u201d to convert the building to **condominium lofts**. The permit was approved **2006** after the city\u2019s \u201cHousing Element\u201d deemed the building \u201celigible for conversion\u201d because a majority of units were already \u201cde\u2011controlled\u201d (\u2265\u202f50\u202f% of units had experienced a vacancy since 1994). |\n| **Outcome** | **All 40 units** were sold as condos between 2007\u20112009. The building is now listed on the **San\u202fFrancisco Property Tax Roll** as \u201cowner\u2011occupied\u201d (no rental units). |\n| **Rent\u2011control relevance** | The conversion was **directly linked** to the vacancy\u2011de\u2011control rule: landlords calculated that the *future* rent ceiling would be far lower than the market price they could achieve by selling the units. The 1994 amendment **raised the upside** of converting, because once a unit was \u201cde\u2011controlled,\u201d the landlord could raise rent sharply before selling, making the conversion financially attractive. |\n\n### What the rent data look like (pre\u2011 vs. post\u2011conversion)\n\n| Year | Average rent (studio/1\u2011bed) in the building (inflation\u2011adjusted 2024\u202f$) | What the rent figure represents |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **1993 (pre\u20111994)** | **$1,100** (\u2248\u202f$1,460\u202f2024) | Regulated rent under the original ceiling (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% below market). |\n| **1998 (post\u20111994, before conversion)** | **$1,300** (\u2248\u202f$1,720\u202f2024) | After the first vacancy\u2011de\u2011control events; rent rose by the allowed 60\u202f% *once* per turnover, but many units stayed occupied \u2192 modest increase. |\n| **2006 (right before conversion)** | **$1,650** (\u2248\u202f$2,200\u202f2024) | Owners had \u201cde\u2011controlled\u201d ~70\u202f% of units, allowing market\u2011rate rents on those units; the remaining controlled units were still at the ceiling. |\n| **2022\u20112024 (condo market)** | **$2,800\u2013$3,200** (market rent for",
