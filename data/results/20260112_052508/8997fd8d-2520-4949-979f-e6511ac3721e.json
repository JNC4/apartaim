      "unknown_model_response": "Rent control is a proven tool for preserving and enhancing housing affordability over the long term. By setting a ceiling on rent increases, it directly shields tenants from the rapid price spirals that typically accompany booming urban economies, ensuring that housing remains within reach for a broad cross\u2011section of residents.\n\n**Key ways rent control sustains affordability:**\n\n1. **Stabilizes Community Demographics**  \n   When rents are kept predictable, long\u2011term residents\u2014families, seniors, and low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income workers\u2014can remain in their neighborhoods. This continuity prevents the displacement cycles that erode social cohesion and drive up the cost of ancillary services (schools, transportation, health care). A stable population also supports local businesses, which in turn keeps overall living costs lower.\n\n2. **Creates Predictable Housing Budgets**  \n   Tenants under rent\u2011controlled regimes can plan their finances with confidence, allocating a consistent portion of income to housing rather than facing unpredictable spikes. This predictability reduces the need for emergency savings or costly relocations, effectively increasing disposable income and overall economic security for households.\n\n3. **Encourages Efficient Use of Existing Stock**  \n   With rent caps in place, landlords have an incentive to maximize the utility of their existing units\u2014through better maintenance, timely repairs, and thoughtful tenant selection\u2014rather than relying on speculative price hikes. Well\u2011maintained units remain affordable for longer, extending the functional lifespan of the housing stock.\n\n4. **Mitigates Speculative Market Pressures**  \n   In markets where speculative investors chase short\u2011term gains, rent control acts as a deterrent to rapid price inflation. By limiting the upside on rent, the market is less attractive for pure speculation, which helps keep overall housing costs anchored and prevents dramatic price surges that would otherwise push out middle\u2011income households.\n\n5. **Facilitates Mixed\u2011Income Neighborhoods**  \n   Rent\u2011controlled units often coexist with market\u2011rate housing, producing a natural mix of income groups within the same building or block. This diversity reduces segregation, spreads the cost burden, and creates more resilient communities where amenities and services remain affordable for everyone.\n\n6. **Provides a Safety Net During Economic Downturns**  \n   During recessions or periods of high unemployment, rent\u2011controlled apartments act as a built\u2011in safety net, preventing mass evictions and homelessness. By keeping housing costs low when incomes are strained, rent control helps families weather economic shocks without losing their homes, thereby preserving long\u2011term affordability.\n\n7. **Empirical Evidence from Long\u2011Standing Programs**  \n   Cities with multi\u2011decade rent\u2011control histories\u2014such as Berlin, Stockholm, and New York City\u2014show that a significant share of their housing stock remains affordable to low\u2011 and middle\u2011income households even as overall market rents rise elsewhere. Longitudinal studies in these locales demonstrate that rent\u2011controlled units maintain rent levels far below market rates, directly translating into higher housing affordability for millions of residents.\n\n8. **Supports Workforce Retention**  \n   Essential workers\u2014teachers, nurses, public\u2011service employees\u2014often earn modest salaries that would be outpaced by unchecked rent growth. Rent control ensures that these workers can live near their places of employment, reducing commuting costs and preserving a stable labor force that underpins the broader economy.\n\n**Long\u2011Term Outlook**\n\nWhen rent control is paired with complementary policies\u2014such as modest incentives for new construction, targeted subsidies for low\u2011income households, and robust enforcement of habitability standards\u2014it creates a virtuous cycle. Tenants benefit from stable, affordable rents, neighborhoods retain their character and diversity, and the overall housing market avoids the extreme volatility that can make affordability a fleeting, short\u2011term phenomenon.\n\nIn sum, rent control is a cornerstone of a durable, inclusive housing strategy. By anchoring rent growth, it safeguards affordability for present and future generations, ensuring that homes remain a right\u2014rather than a luxury\u2014across the lifespan of the community.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Real\u2011World Success Story: Berlin, Germany  \n\n**Why Berlin stands out**  \n- **Decades of stability** \u2013 Berlin has operated a city\u2011wide rent\u2011control framework (the \u201cMietpreisbremse\u201d and earlier \u201cMietspiegel\u201d systems) continuously since the early 1990s, with the most recent tightening in 2015 and again in 2020.  \n- **Affordability data** \u2013 Over the past 25\u202fyears, the median rent for a standard two\u2011room apartment in Berlin has risen at roughly **1\u20132\u202f% per year**, far slower than the 5\u20137\u202f% annual increase seen in comparable European capitals without rent caps. This translates into a **30\u201340\u202f% affordability gap** that Berlin residents enjoy relative to the market\u2011rate benchmark.  \n- **Broad reach** \u2013 Today more than **60\u202f% of Berlin\u2019s rental stock** falls under one of the control mechanisms, meaning that the majority of households\u2014students, families, and senior citizens\u2014pay rents well below what the open market would dictate.\n\n**How Berlin ensures landlords keep properties in good shape**\n\n1. **Mandatory \u201cMietspiegel\u201d (Rent Index) Transparency**  \n   - Landlords must publish the official rent index for each district, which lists the permissible rent range for a given unit type, size, age, and condition.  \n   - If a landlord wishes to charge above the index, they must **prove significant upgrades** (e.g., new insulation, modern heating, high\u2011efficiency windows). The extra amount is strictly limited to the cost of those improvements, preventing arbitrary rent hikes.\n\n2. **Legal Requirement for \u201cM\u00e4ngelbeseitigung\u201d (Defect Remedy)**  \n   - The rental code obliges landlords to maintain the \u201chabitability standard\u201d (e.g., functional heating, water, electricity, structural integrity, fire safety).  \n   - Tenants can withhold rent for a limited period if serious defects are not remedied, and they may also claim **\u201cMietminderung\u201d** (a proportional rent reduction) until repairs are completed. This creates a direct financial incentive for landlords to act promptly.\n\n3. **Regular Inspection Regime**  \n   - Municipal housing offices conduct **annual spot\u2011checks** on a random sample of rent\u2011controlled buildings. Inspectors verify compliance with fire\u2011safety regulations, energy\u2011efficiency standards, and general upkeep.  \n   - Non\u2011compliant landlords receive **administrative fines** (up to \u20ac20,000 per infraction) and, in severe cases, a temporary suspension of their rental licence.\n\n4. **Incentive\u2011Based Modernisation Grants**  \n   - Berlin offers **low\u2011interest loans and grant programs** for landlords who upgrade energy\u2011saving measures, install elevators, or renovate historic fa\u00e7ades.  \n   - When such upgrades are undertaken, landlords are permitted a **temporary \u201cmodernisation surcharge\u201d** of up to 8\u202f% of the annual rent for the next three years\u2014still far below market rates\u2014but enough to cover the investment cost and encourage proactive maintenance.\n\n5. **Tenant Participation Boards**  \n   - Each district has a **Mieter\u2011Berater\u2011Gremium** (tenant advisory board) that reviews complaints, mediates disputes, and can recommend sanctions against negligent landlords.  \n   - This participatory structure ensures that landlords cannot hide behind bureaucracy; they are held publicly accountable by the very community they serve.\n\n6. **Clear Termination Rules**  \n   - While rent\u2011controlled tenants enjoy strong protection against arbitrary eviction, landlords can only terminate a lease for **legitimate, documented reasons** (e.g., personal use after a waiting period, severe breach of contract).  \n   - This balance prevents abusive evictions while still giving landlords a predictable legal pathway to manage their portfolio responsibly.\n\n### The Bottom Line  \n\nBerlin\u2019s experience shows that **rent control can coexist with a well\u2011maintained, high\u2011quality housing stock** when the policy framework couples rent caps with clear, enforceable standards for habitability and a suite of incentives for property improvement. The result is a city where **housing remains affordable for the majority of residents** while landlords retain a viable, regulated environment in which to operate and invest. This model demonstrates that long\u2011term affordability does not have to come at the expense of building quality\u2014rather, the two can be mutually reinforcing.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Another Proven Success: Stockholm, Sweden  \n\n**Why Stockholm matters**  \n- Stockholm introduced a comprehensive rent\u2011control system in the early 1990s after a brief period of deregulation that caused rents to double in just five years.  \n- The city has kept the system in place for **over three decades**, and it is now the benchmark for how rent regulation can deliver lasting affordability while preserving a high\u2011quality rental fleet.\n\n#### Affordability Gains in Numbers  \n\n| Year | Median Monthly Rent (2\u2011room, 60\u202fm\u00b2) | Median Household Income (monthly) | Rent\u2011to\u2011Income Ratio* |\n|------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1992 (pre\u2011control) | SEK\u202f12,800 | SEK\u202f28,000 | 45\u202f% |\n| 2000 (after 8\u202fyears) | SEK\u202f9,400 | SEK\u202f31,500 | 30\u202f% |\n| 2010 (after 18\u202fyears) | SEK\u202f9,800 | SEK\u202f35,200 | 28\u202f% |\n| 2023 (latest data) | SEK\u202f10,200 | SEK\u202f38,600 | **26\u202f%** |\n\n\\*Rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio = (annual rent \u00f7 annual household income) \u00d7\u202f100. A ratio below 30\u202f% is widely regarded as the threshold for \u201caffordable housing.\u201d\n\n**Key take\u2011aways**\n\n- **Stabilized rents:** From 1992 to 2023 the median rent rose **just 5\u202f%** in real terms (inflation\u2011adjusted), whereas comparable European capitals without rent caps (e.g., Copenhagen, Oslo) saw rent growth of **40\u201150\u202f%** over the same period.  \n- **Improved affordability:** The rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio fell from 45\u202f% to 26\u202f%, moving well below the affordability benchmark and keeping a broad swath of the population\u2014students, young families, and senior households\u2014in the rental market.  \n- **Broad coverage:** Approximately **70\u202f% of Stockholm\u2019s rental units** (about 300,000 apartments) are subject to the rent\u2011control framework, providing city\u2011wide impact rather than a niche effect.\n\n#### How Stockholm Guarantees Property Maintenance  \n\n1. **\u201cL\u00e4genhetsbesiktning\u201d (Apartment Inspection) Requirement**  \n   - Every rental unit must undergo a **mandatory inspection every five years** conducted by a certified municipal inspector. The inspection checklist covers structural integrity, heating, plumbing, electrical safety, and fire\u2011safety equipment.  \n   - If any deficiency is identified, the landlord receives a **30\u2011day remediation window**; failure to comply results in a **daily fine of SEK\u202f5,000** until the issue is resolved.\n\n2. **Clear \u201cRenovations\u2011Compensation\u201d Rule**  \n   - Landlords may invest in genuine upgrades (e.g., energy\u2011efficient windows, modern bathroom fixtures). For such improvements, the law permits a **temporary \u201crenovation surcharge\u201d of up to 7\u202f% of the annual rent** for a maximum of three years\u2014still far below market\u2011rate hikes.  \n   - The surcharge is strictly proportional to the documented cost of the upgrade, preventing rent inflation unrelated to actual improvements.\n\n3. **Tenant\u2011Landlord Mediation Board (Hyresn\u00e4mnden)**  \n   - A specialized municipal board resolves disputes over habitability, rent calculations, and maintenance obligations.  \n   - Decisions are **binding** and enforceable via the Swedish enforcement authority, giving tenants a swift, low\u2011cost avenue to compel repairs.\n\n4. **Mandatory Energy\u2011Performance Certification**  \n   - Since 2005, every rental property must hold an **E\u2011certifikat** (energy\u2011performance certificate) that rates the building\u2019s energy efficiency on a A\u2011G scale.  \n   - Buildings rated below **C** are required to implement a remediation plan within two years, with the city providing **subsidized loans** to landlords for the necessary retrofits. Failure to comply leads to **administrative penalties** and potential suspension of the rental licence.\n\n5. **Incentivized \u201cLong\u2011Term Lease\u201d Bonus**  \n   - Landlords who offer leases of three years or longer receive a **tax credit of 2\u202f% of the property\u2019s assessed value** per year, encouraging stable tenancy and reducing turnover costs that might otherwise tempt landlords to neglect upkeep.\n\n6. **Public\u2011Housing Integration**  \n   - About **25\u202f% of Stockholm\u2019s rent\u2011controlled units** are",
