      "unknown_model_response": "**Bottom line:**  The overwhelming majority of empirical work finds **no reliable evidence that the death penalty deters homicide (or other serious crimes) more than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole**.  Most criminologists, legal scholars, and policy\u2011analysis bodies conclude that, if anything, the certainty of being caught and punished matters far more than the severity of the ultimate sanction.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the most\u2011cited research, organized by the major questions that arise when we ask \u201cdoes the death penalty deter?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the data actually measure  \n\n|\u202fDeterrence concept\u202f|\u202fHow it is tested\u202f|\u202fKey limitation\u202f|\n|---|---|---|\n|**General deterrence** (society\u2011wide reduction in murders) |Compare homicide rates before/after a jurisdiction introduces, suspends, or abolishes the death penalty; or compare states/countries that retain it vs. those that do not. |\u2013 Few jurisdictions change the law, so \u201cnatural experiments\u2019\u2019 are rare.<br>\u2013 Homicide rates fluctuate for many reasons (economy, policing, gun availability, demographics).<br>\u2013 Death\u2011penalty cases are a tiny fraction of all murders, so the \u201csignal\u2019\u2019 is swamped by noise. |\n|**Specific deterrence** (preventing a convicted offender from killing again) |Follow convicted murderers who receive death sentences vs. life\u2011without\u2011parole (LWOP) and see how many commit another homicide while incarcerated. |\u2013 Almost all death\u2011sentence holders are isolated in death\u2011row units, making a second murder logistically unlikely.<br>\u2013 Sample sizes are tiny (a few hundred cases in the U.S.). |\n|**\u201cCertainty vs. severity\u2019\u2019** |Statistical models that include both the probability of being caught (clearance rate) and the harshness of the penalty. |\u2013 Data on detection probabilities are imperfect; many murders are never solved. |\n\nBecause the death penalty is **rarely applied** (in the U.S. <\u202f0.1\u202f% of homicide offenders receive it) and because **most homicide offenders are never apprehended**, any measurable deterrent effect would have to be *very large* to show up in aggregate crime statistics.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The authors attribute **\u2248\u202f70\u202f%** of the homicide decline to improved investigative success, the remainder to broader social\u2011economic trends. |\n\n### Why the link is credible\n\n1. **Temporal ordering** \u2013 clearance rates began to climb **before** the steepest drop in murders (the biggest clearance jump was 1994\u20111995; homicide fell most sharply 1995\u20111997).  \n2. **Dose\u2011response pattern** \u2013 precincts that achieved larger clearance gains saw larger homicide reductions (Mummolo & Peterson).  \n3. **Controls for confounders** \u2013 the regression models include unemployment, cocaine\u2011price indexes, and demographic changes; the clearance\u2011rate coefficient remains statistically significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.01).  \n4. **Replication** \u2013 similar patterns have been documented in other large U.S. cities that introduced data\u2011driven policing, e.g., **Los\u202fAngeles (1995\u20112001)** and **Chicago",
