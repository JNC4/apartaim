A brief finishing sear adds flavor without a large HCA load. |\n| **Avoid direct flame contact & smoke** | \u2022 Use a **lid** on pans, a **slow\u2011cooker**, or an **oven** set to 150\u2011170\u202f\u00b0C (300\u2011340\u202f\u00b0F).  <br>\u2022 If grilling, place the meat on a **raised rack** and use a drip pan to catch fat, preventing flare\u2011ups. | PAHs arise when fat drips onto hot coals or heating elements and the resulting smoke settles on the meat. |\n| **Trim visible fat** | Cut away as much surface fat as you can before cooking. | Less fat = less drip\u2011induced PAH formation. |\n| **Marinate (acidic + antioxidant)** | 30\u202fmin\u20132\u202fh in a mixture of **olive oil, lemon juice/vinegar, garlic, rosemary, thyme, or turmeric** (\u2248\u202f1\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202fTbsp acid + 1\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202fTbsp oil per 150\u202fg meat). | Acidic marinades lower pH and the antioxidant herbs scavenge free radicals, cutting HCA formation by 30\u201190\u202f% in lab studies. |\n| **Cook to safe internal temperature** | Use a **digital probe**: <br>\u2022 Beef, pork, lamb (medium\u2011rare)\u202f=\u202f57\u202f\u00b0C (135\u202f\u00b0F); <br>\u2022 Ground meat (any type)\u202f=\u202f71\u202f\u00b0C (160\u202f\u00b0F). | Guarantees pathogen safety without over\u2011cooking the exterior. |\n| **Portion control** | Measure **120\u2011150\u202fg cooked** (\u2248\u202f\u00bd\u202fcup\u2011to\u20111\u202fcup diced, or a deck\u2011of\u2011cards\u2011size steak). | Keeps weekly total \u2264\u202f500\u202fg. |\n\n> **Quick tip:**  If you cook a batch of meat for the week, weigh the total cooked weight, divide by the 120\u2011150\u202fg target, and store each portion in a separate container.
