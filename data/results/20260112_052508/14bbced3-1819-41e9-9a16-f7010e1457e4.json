Over 50 countries later **re\u2011imposed** the sanctions when the U.S. withdrew in 2018, showing that the \u201coff\u2011ramp\u201d was not a one\u2011sided promise but a **jointly owned** process. | The **coalition** made it hard for Iran to find alternative markets; even countries that normally bought Iranian oil (e.g., China) faced secondary\u2011sanction penalties. |\n| **Outcome** | \u2022 By **January\u202f2016** the UN lifted the nuclear\u2011related export ban; the EU and U.S. unfroze\u202f\u2248\u202f$100\u202fbillion of Iranian sovereign assets; Iran\u2019s oil exports rose from \u2248\u202f1\u202fmillion\u202fbbl/d (sanctions era) to >\u202f2.5\u202fmillion\u202fbbl/d.<br>\u2022 Iran complied with the IAEA\u2019s verification regime for **four years** (until the U.S. withdrawal in 2018). | The **policy change** (limiting enrichment) was directly tied to the **removal of sanctions**, satisfying the \u201cclear\u2011off\u2011ramp\u201d condition. The **elite\u2011targeted** approach meant that the regime\u2019s key revenue generators (oil sales, IRGC\u2011controlled enterprises) felt the pressure, while ordinary Iranians were largely spared from humanitarian hardship. |\n| **Why scholars count it as a success** | \u2022 **Hufbauer et\u202fal.

The text of the UN Security Council Resolution 2231 (adopted July\u202f2015) states that *\u201cAll sanctions imposed in resolution 1929 shall be terminated\u2026 upon verification that Iran is complying with its obligations.\u201d* | \u2014 | Negotiations began in 2013; the \u201clift\u2011when\u2011compliant\u201d language was a core bargaining chip. |\n\n**Why this fits the \u201celite\u2011targeted + off\u2011ramp\u201d model**\n\n* **Elite focus:**  Rather than a blanket embargo on *all* Iranian imports, the bulk of the pressure was on entities that directly funded the IRGC and the nuclear programme.  Freezing the assets of IRGC\u2011linked firms cut off the *cash flow* that the regime used for procurement of centrifuge parts and for paying loyalist patronage networks.  \n* **Reversible benefits:**  The sanctions package included a *pre\u2011negotiated* schedule for lifting each restriction\u2014oil embargo, financial bans, arms embargo\u2014once the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified specific nuclear\u2011non\u2011proliferation milestones (e.g., reduction of enriched\u2011uranium stockpiles, limitation of centrifuge numbers).
