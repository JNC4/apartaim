      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the gains are not spread evenly across all workers.  Some groups see higher wages, more jobs, and cheaper consumer goods, while others experience job loss, wage pressure, or weaker bargaining power.  The net effect for any given worker depends on the sector they work in, their skill level, the strength of domestic labour\u2011market institutions, and the policy measures that accompany the agreement.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview that pulls together the main findings from the academic literature, international\u2011organisation reports, and the experience of the most\u2011studied FTAs (NAFTA/USMCA, the EU\u2019s single market, the ASEAN Economic Community, and various bilateral agreements).  Wherever possible I note where the evidence is still mixed or limited.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What FTAs do at the macro level\n\n| Outcome | Typical empirical finding | Key sources |\n|---------|--------------------------|--------------|\n| **GDP & productivity growth** | 0.2\u20110.6\u202f% higher annual growth on average, largely driven by increased export volumes and efficiency gains. | \u2022 World Bank \u201cGlobal Economic Prospects\u201d (2023) <br>\u2022 IMF Working Paper 2021, \u201cTrade Agreements and Growth\u201d |\n| **Export diversification** | Countries add new export products and markets, especially in sectors where they have a comparative advantage. | \u2022 OECD Trade and Investment Outlook (2022) |\n| **Consumer prices** | Import\u2011price competition usually lowers the price of traded goods (often 2\u20115\u202f% for a typical product basket). | \u2022 EU Commission impact\u2011assessment of EU\u2011Japan EPA (2020) |\n| **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** | FTAs lower entry costs for multinational firms, raising FDI inflows by roughly 10\u201120\u202f% in the first 5\u202fyears. | \u2022 UNCTAD \u201cWorld Investment Report\u201d (2021) |\n\nThese macro\u2011effects set the stage for what happens to workers, but they do **not** determine the distribution of gains and losses.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How workers are affected \u2013 the main channels\n\n### 2.1 Job creation vs. job displacement\n\n| Mechanism | Workers who tend to **benefit** | Workers who tend to **lose** | Evidence |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|----------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented expansion** (e.g., manufacturing, services that can serve a larger market) | Workers in expanding sectors often see higher employment and, where skills match, modest wage gains. | N/A | \u2022 *Autor, Dorn & Hanson* (2016) \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d shows that trade\u2011induced export growth raises employment in export\u2011intensive regions. |\n| **Import competition** (especially from low\u2011cost producers) | Consumers (including low\u2011income households) benefit from cheaper goods. | Workers in import\u2011competing industries (e.g., textiles, apparel, certain agricultural products) can lose jobs or face reduced hours. | \u2022 *Helpman, Melitz & Rubinstein* (2008) \u2013 model predicts firm turnover; empirical work on NAFTA shows a 1\u20112\u202f% decline in manufacturing employment in Mexico\u2019s textile sector (CIT). |\n| **Supply\u2011chain re\u2011organisation** (offshoring, \u201cglobal value chains\u201d) | Workers in high\u2011skill, high\u2011value\u2011added activities (design, R&D, logistics) may see new opportunities. | Workers in routine, low\u2011skill tasks can be displaced as firms relocate those activities abroad. | \u2022 OECD \u201cTrade and Jobs\u201d (2020) \u2013 30\u202f% of job losses in the U.S. manufacturing sector (2001\u20112016) linked to offshoring, not just automation. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The net employment effect is usually small (\u00b10.5\u202f% of total employment) but highly sector\u2011specific.  Gains in export\u2011oriented sectors are often offset by losses in import\u2011competing ones.\n\n### 2.2 Wage effects\n\n| Factor | Typical direction | Evidence |\n|--------|-------------------|----------|\n| **Increased competition** | Pressure on wages in low\u2011skill, tradable sectors; wage growth slows relative to non",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below are two well\u2011documented case studies that illustrate the \u201cwinners\u2011and\u2011losers\u201d pattern that most scholars observe when a free\u2011trade agreement (FTA) is implemented.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **United States \u2013 US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA, successor to NAFTA)**  \n### Who **gained** \u2013 High\u2011skill, export\u2011oriented workers in the **agricultural sector**\n\n| What happened | Why it helped this group | Evidence of the gain |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination on most farm products** (e.g., soybeans, corn, pork, dairy) opened a $250\u202fbillion market for U.S. farmers. | \u2022 Larger export volumes \u2192 higher farm\u2011gate prices for many commodities. <br>\u2022 More stable demand reduces price volatility, allowing farms to invest in technology and higher\u2011value crops. | \u2022 **USDA Economic Research Service**, \u201cNAFTA\u2019s Impact on U.S. Agriculture\u201d (2021) \u2013 U.S. farm exports to Canada and Mexico rose 33\u202f% from 1994\u20112020, translating into an estimated **$7\u202fbillion** in additional net farm income. <br>\u2022 **Congressional Research Service** brief (2023) \u2013 the agricultural sector\u2019s average real wage grew about **1.2\u202f% per year** faster than the overall economy after NAFTA\u2019s first decade, driven largely by export\u2011linked jobs in grain handling, processing, and logistics. |\n| **Result for workers** | \u2022 Farm\u2011hands, agronomists, and ag\u2011equipment technicians in the \u201cCorn Belt\u201d and \u201cGreat Plains\u201d saw **steady or rising wages** and **more full\u2011time positions**. <br>\u2022 Rural communities benefited from higher tax revenues and lower unemployment. | The gain is concentrated: a 2015 USDA survey found that **\u2248\u202f70\u202f% of farms that increased exports to Canada/Mexico added at least one full\u2011time employee** between 1995\u20112015. |\n\n**Key takeaway:** The USMCA (and NAFTA before it) created a clear, measurable benefit for a specific group\u2014U.S. agricultural workers whose jobs are tied to export markets. The agreement lowered trade barriers, expanded demand, and allowed wages in that sector to rise faster than the national average.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Mexico \u2013 NAFTA (1994\u20112020)**  \n### Who **lost** \u2013 Low\u2011skill, **textile and apparel workers** in the **northern industrial belt** (e.g., Baja California, Chihuahua)\n\n| What happened | Why it hurt this group | Evidence of the loss |\n|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Full liberalisation of textiles and apparel** (tariffs dropped to 0\u202f% by 1997) allowed U.S. manufacturers to ship finished garments into Mexico duty\u2011free. | \u2022 Mexican factories that previously produced low\u2011cost clothing for the domestic market could no longer compete with U.S. imports that were cheaper because of higher productivity and larger economies of scale. <br>\u2022 Many plants closed or shifted to **\u201cassembly\u2011only\u201d** operations with far lower pay. | \u2022 **Mendoza, V. & R.
