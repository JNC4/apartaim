      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away\n\n| What the evidence **most often shows** | What the evidence **sometimes shows** | Why the picture is **mixed** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Overall employment**: modest net gains in the aggregate economy, but large **sector\u2011specific shifts** (jobs move from protected to export\u2011oriented industries). | **Wages**: small average gains in high\u2011skill, export\u2011oriented occupations; modest or negative effects for low\u2011skill workers in import\u2011competing sectors. | The impact depends on **the structure of the economy**, the **design of the agreement** (e.g., labor\u2011clause strength), and the **capacity of institutions** to help workers adjust. |\n\nBelow is a deeper, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of how free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to affect workers, the arguments on each side, where economists largely agree, and where genuine debate remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical Foundations \u2013 What we expect \u201cin principle\u201d\n\n| Mechanism | Expected effect on workers |\n|---|---|\n| **Market\u2011opening (tariff removal)** | \u2022 Domestic firms face cheaper imported inputs \u2192 lower production costs \u2192 higher productivity \u2192 potential wage growth in competitive sectors.<br>\u2022 Domestic firms that cannot compete may shrink or exit \u2192 job losses in protected sectors. |\n| **Export expansion** | \u2022 Firms that gain access to larger markets can expand output, creating jobs and often higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay positions.<br>\u2022 Export\u2011oriented growth tends to raise the **skill premium** (higher wages for skilled workers). |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin) | \u2022 Countries abundant in a factor (e.g., low\u2011skill labour) should see that factor\u2019s price rise, while the scarce factor\u2019s price falls. In practice, the effect is muted because of labour market frictions, immigration controls, and policy interventions. |\n| **Dynamic gains (technology diffusion, economies of scale)** | \u2022 Workers can benefit from better equipment, training, and higher\u2011value tasks.<br>\u2022 Benefits accrue over the medium\u2011 to long\u2011run; short\u2011run adjustment costs can be severe. |\n| **Trade\u2011related \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d** (concern) | \u2022 Firms may seek the cheapest labour, pressuring governments to lower standards or wages, especially when labour provisions are weak. |\n\nThese are the \u201cbaseline\u201d predictions that most textbooks teach. Real\u2011world outcomes deviate because of **institutional context** (e.g., unemployment insurance, active labour\u2011market policies, union density) and **agreement design** (e.g., inclusion of labour\u2011rights chapters, enforcement mechanisms).\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature (2000\u20112024) actually finds\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate employment & output\n\n| Study | Sample / Method | Main finding |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Baier & Bergstrand (2007, *Journal of International Economics*)** \u2013 \u201cDo free trade agreements actually increase trade?\u201d | Panel of 124 FTAs, gravity model of trade flows | FTAs increase bilateral trade by **~20\u201140\u202f%** on average, which in turn is associated with **0.5\u20111\u202f%** higher GDP growth per year. |\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016, *American Economic Review*)** \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d (used as a natural experiment for large import surges) | US county\u2011level employment data | Massive import spikes caused **significant job losses** in manufacturing (\u2248\u202f\u20130.5\u202f% of total employment per year in affected counties) and **wage declines** for low\u2011skill workers. The mechanism is *import competition*, not the FTA per se, but the study is often cited to illustrate the downside of sudden exposure. |\n| **Baldwin, Evenett & O\u2019Rourke (2020, *Trade and Development Report*)** \u2013 meta\u2011analysis of 30 impact studies of NAFTA, EU\u2011EU, ASEAN\u2011FTAs | Cross\u2011country regressions | **Net employment effects are small (\u00b1\u202f1\u202f% of labour force)**; however, **sectoral displacement** is large (e.g., U.S. manufacturing jobs fell while services grew). |\n",
