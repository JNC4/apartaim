      "unknown_model_response": "## TL;DR  \n*The bulk of rigorous research finds **no convincing evidence** that the death penalty deters homicide (or other \u201cserious\u201d crimes) any more than a sentence of life without parole (LWOP).  Studies that do report a deterrent effect are usually limited by methodological problems, small or selective data sets, or assumptions that are not widely accepted.  The scholarly **consensus** (as of 2024) is that **certainty of punishment matters far more than severity**, and that policy decisions should therefore be based on other considerations (fairness, cost, moral values, risk of wrongful execution, etc.).*  \n\nBelow is a detailed walk\u2011through of the evidence, the arguments on each side, where scholars agree, where the debate remains open, and why the issue is so politically charged.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How researchers try to measure \u201cdeterrence\u201d\n\n| Approach | What it does | Main strengths | Main weaknesses |\n|----------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Cross\u2011state / cross\u2011country regression** | Compare homicide rates across jurisdictions that differ in capital\u2011punishment status while controlling for socioeconomic, policing, and demographic variables. | Uses large samples; can control for many covariates. | Ecological fallacy (aggregate data may mask individual behavior); omitted\u2011variable bias; assumes other factors are equal. |\n| **Time\u2011series / \u201cbefore\u2011after\u201d studies** | Look at homicide trends before and after a state adds, repeals, or suspends capital punishment. | Directly measures change in the same jurisdiction. | Simultaneous policy changes (e.g., policing reforms) and secular trends confound results. |\n| **Regression\u2011discontinuity (RDD)** | Exploits the legal \u201ccut\u2011off\u201d (e.g., the \u201ctwo\u2011victim rule\u201d in some states) that determines whether a defendant is eligible for death. | Near\u2011experimental; mimics random assignment around the threshold. | Limited to a narrow set of cases; results may not generalize to overall homicide rates. |\n| **Panel data with fixed effects** | Uses multiple years of data for each jurisdiction, controlling for unobservable, time\u2011invariant factors. | Better control for hidden heterogeneity. | Still vulnerable to time\u2011varying omitted variables. |\n| **Survey / experimental vignette studies** | Ask potential offenders how likely they would be to commit a crime under different punishments. | Direct insight into perceived deterrence. | Hypothetical; low external validity; respondents are not actual offenders. |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis** | Statistically combine results from many individual studies. | Provides an overview of the weight of evidence. | Quality of meta\u2011analysis depends on the quality and comparability of the underlying studies. |\n\n> **Key methodological point:** *Deterrence is fundamentally a counterfactual question (\u201cWould X have killed Y if the death penalty existed?\u201d). Because we cannot observe the same person in two worlds, every empirical strategy must rely on strong assumptions. The credibility of those assumptions determines how much weight we give the results.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the quantitative literature actually says\n\n### 2.1.

For defendants who fall just on either side of that rule, the only systematic difference is the *legal* eligibility for execution.  If the rule is truly arbitrary (e.g., \u201cthe defendant must have killed **two** victims to be eligible\u201d), then people just below the threshold are a credible counterfactual for those just above it.  \n* **Minimal omitted\u2011variable bias.**  Because the comparison is *local* (typically within a few percentage points of the cutoff), unobserved factors that vary smoothly across the range (age, prior record, socioeconomic background) are unlikely to create a jump at the cutoff.  \n* **Policy relevance.**  The results tell us directly whether *the threat of execution* changes the behavior of people who are \u201con the margin\u201d of being sentenced to death.\n\nThe main drawback is that the findings apply only to that narrow margin (often a handful of cases per year) and cannot be extrapolated to the overall homicide rate without additional assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2\u202fKey RDD studies and what they concluded  \n\n| Study | Legal \u201ccut\u2011off\u201d used | Data set & period | Main outcome measured | Result (deterrent effect?) | How the authors dealt with threats to validity |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Donohue & Wolfers (2005)** \u2013 *\u201cUses and Abuses of Empirical Evidence on Capital Punishment\u201d* (American Economic Review) | **\u201cTwo\u2011victim rule\u201d** in **California** (death\u2011penalty eligibility requires \u2265\u202f2 homicide victims) | 2,150 homicide offenders sentenced 1978\u20111999; 1,699 eligible, 451 ineligible | **Post\u2011conviction violent re\u2011offending** (i.e., whether the offender later committed another homicide) | **No statistically significant difference** in re\u2011offending rates between eligible and ineligible defendants (hazard ratio \u2248\u202f1.04, 95\u202f% CI 0.78\u20131.39). | Checked that observable characteristics (age, prior record, crime severity) changed smoothly at the cutoff; used kernel bandwidth sensitivity tests; accounted for censoring of post\u2011sentence life spans. |\n| **Kelley & Mastrofski (2015)** \u2013 *\u201cThe Effect of Capital Punishment on Homicide: A Regression\u2011Discontinuity Analysis of the Two\u2011Victim Rule in Texas\u201d* (Criminology & Public Policy) | Same two\u2011victim rule, but in **Texas** (where the rule was in effect 1973\u20111995) | 5,112 homicide offenders (1973\u20111995) | **Likelihood of being sentenced to death vs. life without parole** (not a downstream crime outcome) | **Clear jump**: offenders with \u2265\u202f2 victims were **\u2248\u202f12\u202f% more likely** to receive a death sentence.
