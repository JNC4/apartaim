This conclusion rests on three pillars:\n\n1. **Rigorous pre\u2011market safety testing** (molecular, toxicological, allergenicity, nutritional analyses).  \n2. **Independent, large\u2011scale comparative studies** of health outcomes in animals and humans.  \n3. **Consensus statements from major scientific and health organisations** that evaluate the totality of the evidence.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of each pillar, followed by the main points of ongoing debate and the current limits of knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the safety testing looks like\n\n| Step | What is examined | Typical methods |\n|------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Molecular characterisation** | Insertion site, copy number, presence of unintended DNA/RNA | Whole\u2011genome sequencing, Southern blot, PCR |\n| **Protein safety** | Toxicity & allergenicity of the newly expressed protein(s) | 90\u2011day rodent feeding studies, acute toxicity tests, bioinformatics comparison to known allergens/toxins, serum IgE binding assays |\n| **Nutritional equivalence** | Macro\u2011 and micronutrient profile, anti\u2011nutrients | Proximate analysis, metabolomics, animal feeding trials |\n| **Whole\u2011food animal feeding** | Chronic health effects, organ pathology, reproduction | 90\u2011day, 180\u2011day, or multigenerational rodent studies (e.g., EFSA 2010; FDA 2018) |\n| **Post\u2011market monitoring** | Unexpected adverse events | Surveillance of adverse\u2011event reports, epidemiologic studies, food\u2011chain traceability |\n\nThese tests are required (or strongly recommended) by **regulatory agencies** in the U.S., EU, Canada, Japan, Australia, and many other jurisdictions before a GM product can be commercialised.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
