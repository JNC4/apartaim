      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a quick reminder**\n\n| What QE is | How it is implemented | What it is supposed to do |\n|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| A large\u2011scale purchase of financial assets (mostly government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities) by the central bank. | The central bank creates reserves \u201cout of thin air\u201d and uses them to buy the assets on the secondary market. | 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Push long\u2011term interest rates down.<br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Raise the price of the assets it buys (lower yields).<br>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Encourage banks and other lenders to lend more to the private sector.<br>4\ufe0f\u20e3 Spur spending, investment, and ultimately inflation when the economy is below capacity. |\n\nBecause QE works through **financial\u2011market channels** (interest rates, asset\u2011price changes, exchange\u2011rate movements, credit\u2011supply shifts), its distributional consequences are uneven. Below is a systematic map of who tends to **gain**, who tends to **lose**, where the evidence is strongest, where scholars still disagree, and why the debate matters.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The magnitude is modest (\u22485\u201110\u202f% over a year) but statistically significant. |\n| **Bank\u2011lending incentives** (higher reserves, lower funding costs) | Small\u2011business borrowers, mortgage borrowers, consumers seeking credit | Banks that rely on net\u2011interest\u2011margin income (short\u2011term deposit\u2011rate vs loan\u2011rate spread) may see margins compress if loan\u2011rate falls faster than deposit\u2011rate | Empirical work (e.g., Neely, 2015; Adrian & Shin, 2020) shows a modest rise in loan growth after QE, but with large cross\u2011country heterogeneity. |\n| **Inflation expectations** (central bank signals commitment to hitting a higher inflation target) | Debtors (real value of debt erodes) | Creditor\u2011type savers (fixed\u2011income holders) | Survey\u2011based studies (e.g., IMF World Economic Outlook, 2021) show a small but measurable rise in long\u2011run inflation expectations after QE rounds.",

The house\u2011price boost, however, remains as a **stock\u2011gain** that can be realised by selling or borrowing against the home. | \u2013 Bob faces higher rent if landlords pass on higher financing costs, but the increase is usually **delayed** and smaller than the house\u2011price jump. |\n| **Bottom line after 1\u202fyear** | **Wealth \u2191** by roughly $6\u20138\u202fk, plus any additional equity built through mortgage amortization (\u2248$2\u202fk). | **Wealth stays flat** (or may even fall slightly if rent rises faster than income). |\n\n### Why the difference?\n\n| Mechanism | How it helps the homeowner | How it hurts (or does nothing for) the renter |\n|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Higher house prices** \u2013 the QE\u2011driven fall in yields raises the price of all real\u2011estate assets because investors use bonds as a benchmark for expected returns. | Alice\u2019s house is a market\u2011priced asset; its market value rises automatically. | Bob has no owned property to benefit from price appreciation. |\n| **Lower mortgage rates** \u2013 cheaper long\u2011term borrowing reduces Alice\u2019s interest expense. | Direct cash\u2011flow benefit. | Bob\u2019s rent is set by the landlord; any reduction in the landlord\u2019s financing cost may eventually be passed on, but landlords usually keep a margin, so the benefit is indirect and delayed. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect on consumption** \u2013 higher home equity can be tapped via home\u2011equity lines of credit, refinancing, or simply by feeling richer, leading to higher spending. | Alice can borrow against the $12\u202fk extra equity (\u22484\u202f% of house value) or feel more secure to spend. | Bob",

The total reserve balance at Community\u202fFirst climbs by about **$150\u202fmillion** (tiny for the system, but enough to change the bank\u2019s internal liquidity position). | With more reserves, the **inter\u2011bank funding rate (Fed Funds)** stays at the floor, and the **spread** between the bank\u2019s cost of funds and the rate it can charge borrowers narrows. |\n| **Risk appetite**: As safe\u2011asset yields fall, investors (including other banks) look for higher\u2011yielding assets\u2014**corporate loans, small\u2011business loans, and equity**. | The bank\u2019s **credit\u2011supply curve shifts right** (it is willing to lend more at any given spread). |\n\n---\n\n### 2.3.
