Decision\u2011makers in the target state (or the elites that control policy) are expected to recalculate the net payoff and either **(1)** change the policy, **(2)** negotiate, or **(3)** risk further escalation. |\n| **Mechanisms** | 1. **Revenue loss** \u2013 e.g., loss of export earnings (oil, minerals, agricultural products).<br>2. **Financial isolation** \u2013 restriction of access to the global banking system, SWIFT bans, denial of foreign investment.<br>3. **Supply\u2011chain disruption** \u2013 denial of key inputs (high\u2011tech components, pharmaceuticals).<br>4. **Political pressure on elites** \u2013 freezing assets abroad, travel bans, reputational costs. | The mechanisms create *economic pressure* (inflation, unemployment, fiscal deficits) that can lead to: <br>\u00b7 Domestic unrest that forces leaders to concede.<br>\u00b7 Elite defections or elite\u2011led negotiations.<br>\u00b7 A strategic decision that the policy in question is no longer worth the economic price. |\n\n---\n\n## The empirical record: How often do sanctions achieve their stated objectives?\n\n### 1. Broad\u2011survey evidence\n\n| Study | Sample / period | Main finding |\n|-------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* (3rd\u202fed.) | 191 cases (1970\u20112005), mostly unilateral or coalition sanctions | **\u2248 34\u202f%** achieved their *explicit* policy goals; success rose to **\u2248 50\u202f%** when sanctions were **multilateral, targeted, and had clear, limited objectives**. |\n| **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox* | 115 cases (1960\u20112009) | **\u2248 30\u202f%** success overall; **multilateral sanctions** were **2\u20133\u00d7** more likely to succeed than unilateral ones. |\n| **Pape (1997)** \u2013 *Why Economic Sanctions Do Not Work* | 40 cases (1945\u20111991) | Argues that **coercive pressure** rarely changes the target\u2019s core foreign\u2011policy goals; most successes are due to **signalling** or **information\u2011gathering** rather than actual compulsion. |\n| **Portela (2020)** \u2013 *Sanctions and Democratic Backsliding* (World Bank) | 203 post\u2011Cold\u2011War cases | **Higher success** when sanctions are **targeted at elites** and when the target country has **open political institutions** that allow elite bargaining. |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:** 30\u201135\u202f% \u201chard\u2011success\u201d rate (policy change) is the rough median across large\u2011scale studies. Success is *significantly* higher when sanctions are (a) multilateral, (b) narrowly targeted, (c) backed by credible threat of escalation, and (d) applied to regimes that are internally vulnerable to elite defection or popular protest.\n\n### 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 what they are meant to do and how well they work**  \n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview that pulls together the strongest research and expert judgments from the whole scholarly and policy literature.  Wherever possible the consensus view is highlighted; where the data are mixed or missing the level of uncertainty is made explicit.  The aim is to give you a \u201ccomplete picture\u201d rather than a persuasive narrative.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The logic of sanctions \u2013 why they are imposed\n\n| Step | What the sanction\u2011giver hopes to achieve | Main theoretical justification |\n|------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Cost imposition** | Raise the economic price of the target\u2019s objectionable behavior (e.g., buying weapons, violating human rights). | *Coercive diplomacy*: \u201cpain\u201d makes the target weigh the cost of continuing the policy against the cost of compliance. |\n| **Incentive creation** | Offer a \u201ccarrot\u201d (e.g., lifting sanctions) if the target changes behavior. | *Bargaining theory*: sanctions act as a lever in a negotiated settlement. |\n| **Signal of resolve** | Demonstrate to both the target and the international community that the sanction\u2011giver (or coalition) is serious and willing to act. | *Signaling theory*: credibility of threats can alter the target\u2019s expectations about future costs. |\n| **Domestic politics** | Show the home electorate that the government is taking action. | *Domestic audience costs*: leaders may face internal pressure to appear tough. |\n| **Norm\u2011building** | Condemn and isolate a regime to reinforce international norms (e.g., non\u2011proliferation, anti\u2011terrorism). | *Constructivist view*: sanctions help shape what is considered acceptable behavior. |\n\n> **Key point:** Sanctions are rarely a single\u2011purpose tool; they combine *coercion*, *incentives*, *signaling*, and *normative* aims.  The relative emphasis varies by case (e.g., UN arms embargo vs. targeted asset freezes).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

This crippled Iran\u2019s ability to conduct international trade, especially in oil. <br>2. **Asset freezes & travel bans** on senior Revolutionary Guard officers, senior nuclear\u2011program officials, and their families created a personal\u2011cost calculus for the elite. <br>3. **Secondary\u2011sanctions threat** \u2013 non\u2011U.S. firms that continued to do business with designated Iranian entities faced denial of access to the U.S. market, which many global firms could not afford. |\n| **Why it worked** | *Multilateral targeting* (U.S., EU, UN) left Iran with **few alternative financial channels**. <br>*Precision* \u2013 the sanctions hit the **revenue\u2011generating oil sector** and the **elite\u2019s personal wealth**, while leaving basic humanitarian imports (food, medicine) largely untouched, reducing domestic backlash. <br>*Clear, limited demand* \u2013 Iran knew exactly what it had to do (reduce enrichment to 3.67\u202f% U\u2011235, accept IAEA inspections) to unlock a **pre\u2011announced, substantial economic benefit** (re\u2011entry into global oil markets, release of frozen assets). <br>*Domestic elite calculations* \u2013 many senior figures in the Revolutionary Guard and the Ministry of Petroleum were personally affected by asset freezes, creating internal pressure to negotiate. |\n| **Outcome** | By early 2016 the **sanctions relief package** unlocked roughly **$100\u202fbillion** of frozen Iranian assets and restored Iran\u2019s ability to sell oil on the world market. Iran complied with the JCPOA\u2019s first\u2011generation commitments (enrichment caps, additional IAEA monitoring). The agreement remained in force until the U.S. unilateral withdrawal in 2018, after which the target\u2011sanctions regime was re\u2011imposed. |\n| **Evidence of success** | \u2022 **International Crisis Group (ICG) 2016 report**: \u201cThe targeted sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil and financial sectors were decisive in bringing Tehran to the negotiating table.\u201d<br>\u2022 **U.S. Treasury \u201cSanctions and the JCPOA\u201d briefing (Sept\u202f2015)** cites \u201cover 90\u202f% of the Iranian oil sector was effectively cut off\u201d and \u201cthe sanctions cost Iran an estimated $5\u20117\u202fbillion per month in lost oil",

They find a **\u2248\u202f75\u202f% drop** in oil\u2011export earnings after the 2012\u20112013 sanction wave, and a **rapid rebound (\u2248\u202f+\u202f70\u202f% of pre\u2011sanction levels) within 6\u202fmonths of the JCPOA\u2011related relief**. | **Strong** \u2013 most scholars cite this as the clearest quantitative \u201csanctions\u2011success\u201d signal for Iran. |\n| **IAEA verification reports (2015\u20112016)** | Showed that Iran\u2019s declared enrichment level fell from 20\u202f% to 3.67\u202f% and that the number of centrifuges in operation dropped by ~\u202f50\u202f% within the first year of the deal. | **Strong** \u2013 technical compliance is widely accepted as evidence that the coercive pressure contributed to the policy change. |\n| **Policy\u2011maker testimony (U.S. Treasury, 2015)** | Officials repeatedly cited the *\u201ctargeted\u2011financial\u2011pressure on the Revolutionary Guard and key oil firms\u201d* as the \u201cpivot\u201d that convinced Tehran that staying out of the deal would be economically untenable. | **Moderate\u2011high** \u2013 internal assessments support the causal story, though they are naturally self\u2011interested. |\n| **Counter\u2011argument \u2013 Gause (2020), *World Politics*** | Argues that domestic political dynamics (hard\u2011liner vs. reformist factions) and the \u201cstrategic patience\u201d of the Iranian leadership were equally decisive; sanctions alone would not have forced a deal. | **Recognized minority view** \u2013 most scholars still treat the targeted sanctions as a *necessary* but not *sufficient* condition",
