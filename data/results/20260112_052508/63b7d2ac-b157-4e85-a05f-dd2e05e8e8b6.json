      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control policies make **existing units cheaper for the tenants who stay in them**, but they tend to **reduce the overall supply of affordable housing** and can **slow the rate at which the market\u2011wide price of rent falls (or rises more slowly)** over the long run. The net effect on \u201chousing affordability for the whole city or region\u201d is therefore usually negative or at best modestly positive, especially when the controls are strict, permanent, or cover a large share of the stock.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the evidence, the economic mechanisms behind it, and the major points of disagreement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic model\n\n| Mechanism | Immediate (short\u2011run) effect | Long\u2011run implication |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Price ceiling on rents** | Tenants in controlled units pay less than the market rent. | Landlords receive lower returns, which can discourage new construction, reduce maintenance, or lead to conversion to non\u2011rental uses. |\n| **Supply response** | Existing stock is unchanged, but owners may **withhold** units from the market (e.g., convert to condos, short\u2011term rentals, or simply keep them vacant). | The **effective supply of rental housing shrinks**, pushing up market rents for uncontrolled units. |\n| **Quality/maintenance** | Landlords cut costs to offset lower rent. | Over time, the **physical quality of controlled units deteriorates**, making them less \u201caffordable\u201d in a broader sense (higher repair costs for tenants, health impacts, etc.). |\n| **Location & turnover** | Tenants have an incentive to stay longer (low \u201cmoving cost\u201d). | **Reduced turnover** means fewer units become available for new renters, reinforcing scarcity. |\n| **Investment incentives** | New developers anticipate lower future returns. | **Fewer new apartments are built**, especially in the price range that would have been rent\u2011controlled. |\n| **Informal markets** | Some landlords may demand \u201ckey money,\u201d side payments, or illegal sub\u2011leases. | These hidden costs can **offset the rent\u2011control benefit** and create equity concerns. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n| Study (region, method) | Main finding on *overall* affordability (city\u2011wide) | Comments / caveats |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Glaeser & Luttmer (2003)** \u2013 New York (natural experiment when rent control was partially lifted | *Positive* \u2013 neighborhoods that lost controls saw a **20\u201130\u202f% rise in rents** and a **30\u202f% drop in housing supply**. | Focuses on a \u201cpartial repeal\u201d; results suggest that controls were *suppressing* rents but also *suppressing* supply. |\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** \u2013 San Francisco (difference\u2011in\u2011differences) | *Negative* \u2013 Rent\u2011controlled units had **15\u202f% lower rents** but **10\u202f% fewer new units** built per year; city\u2011wide rent growth slowed only marginally. | Uses high\u2011resolution tax\u2011parcel data; emphasizes the \u201csupply\u2011side\u201d channel. |\n| **Schwartz (2020)** \u2013 Boston (panel of 1990\u20112018) | *Mixed* \u2013 Low\u2011income renters in controlled units were **better off**, but the **share of low\u2011income households in the city fell** because new low\u2011income units were not built. | Highlights distributional effects. |\n| **Koster, et al.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nAcross the academic and policy literature the *over\u2011whelming* consensus among economists and urban\u2011housing researchers is that **rent\u2011control regimes tend to lower the affordability of housing for the city as a whole in the long run**.  The mechanism is a persistent reduction in the *quantity* (and often the *quality*) of rental units that can be supplied, which pushes market rents upward and makes it harder for new\u2011household formation and low\u2011income families to find housing.  \n\nAt the same time, *well\u2011designed* rent\u2011control policies can provide **short\u2011term rent stability for a limited cohort of existing tenants**, and in some cases can be combined with other interventions (subsidies, vacancy\u2011control exemptions, strong building\u2011code enforcement) to mitigate the supply\u2011side harms.  The net long\u2011run effect therefore depends heavily on the exact design of the regime and on what complementary policies are in place.\n\nBelow is a systematic, source\u2011by\u2011source review that separates:\n\n| Category | What is **well\u2011established** | What is **debated / mixed** | What remains **unknown / under\u2011researched** |\n|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Consensus among scholars** | Rent control reduces new construction and conversion of rental units to condos, leading to a net loss of rental housing over a 10\u2011+\u2011year horizon. | The magnitude of the loss (e.g., 5\u202f% vs. 30\u202f% of the stock) varies by city, policy design, and local market conditions. | Precise long\u2011run elasticity of supply to rent\u2011control restrictions in \u201chigh\u2011growth\u201d vs. \u201cstable\u201d cities. |\n| **Effect on existing tenants** | Tenants who stay in a controlled unit experience lower rent growth than the market (often 30\u201170\u202f% lower). | Whether the welfare gain to these tenants outweighs the welfare loss to new entrants is contested. | Long\u2011term welfare distribution across income groups, especially when households move in/out of control. |\n| **Quality & maintenance** | Many studies find slower maintenance and lower investment in controlled units. | Some jurisdictions (e.g., New York\u2019s \u201cHousing Maintenance Code\u201d enforcement) show no measurable deterioration. | The role of \u201crent\u2011control plus strong inspection regimes\u201d in preserving unit quality. |\n| **Spillover effects** | Controlled rents can raise market rents for uncontrolled units (the \u201cshadow price\u201d effect). | Size of the spillover (e.g., 5\u202f%\u201315\u202f% rent increase) differs across studies. | How spillovers interact with other price\u2011elasticities (e.g., income growth, migration). |\n| **Distributional outcomes** | Rent control is *regressive* in the sense that benefits accrue mainly to the relatively well\u2011off tenants who already have a lease, while low\u2011income newcomers face higher market rents. | Some papers argue that, when coupled with targeted subsidies, rent control can be progressive. | Empirical evidence on combined policies in real\u2011world settings. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.

New developments are free to charge market rates, preserving the **price signal for additional construction**.\n\n2. **Turnover flexibility** \u2013 The ability to raise rent to market levels at each vacancy (subject to a modest aggregate cap) gives landlords a **future\u2011oriented return**. This reduces the incentive to keep units empty, to convert them to condos, or to push tenants out \u201cillegally.\u201d\n\n3. **Incentivised supply** \u2013 The exemption for developers who set aside a share of units as \u201caffordable\u2011by\u2011design\u201d adds a **positive supply side lever** that directly counters the negative supply elasticity that pure rent caps generate.\n\n4. **Regulatory",

For simplicity we set CPI = 2\u202f% \u2192 allowed increase = **9\u202f%** for the first year. | **9\u202f%** |\n| **\u0394\u2082** | Same rule for the second year (again 9\u202f%). | **9\u202f%** |\n| **M** | \u201cMarket rent\u201d for a comparable, **uncontrolled** unit in the same building or neighborhood at the time the tenant vacates. | **$1,800\u202f/\u202fmonth** (this is what a landlord could charge on a newly\u2011rented unit that is not subject to rent\u2011control). |\n| **T\\_vac** | Date the tenant gives notice and actually vacates. | **Month 24** (i.e., after two full years of occupancy). |\n| **R\\_vac** | Rent that the landlord may charge **immediately after vacancy\u2011decontrol** (i.e., the new \u201cbase rent\u201d for the next tenant). | Determined by the law (see step\u202f4). |\n\n---\n\n#### Step\u202f1 \u2013 Tenant moves in (Month\u202f0)\n\n* The unit is **rent\u2011controlled** because it was built before 2010.  \n* The landlord can set any starting rent, but it must be **no higher than the market rent** at that moment.  \n* In our example the landlord charges the tenant **$1,200** (well below the prevailing market rent of $1,800, which is why the tenant sought the unit).\n\n---\n\n#### Step\u202f2 \u2013 First year of tenancy (Months\u202f1\u201112)\n\n* The law permits a **maximum increase of 9\u202f%** over the base rent.  \n* The landlord decides to raise the rent to the legal maximum:  \n\n\\[\nR_{12}=R_{0}\\times(1+\u0394_{1}) = 1{,}200 \\times 1.09 = \\$1{,}308\\;/\\;month\n\\]\n\n* The tenant stays; the rent is now $1,308.\n\n---\n\n#### Step\u202f3 \u2013 Second year of tenancy (Months\u202f13\u201124)\n\n* Again the landlord may raise by up to 9\u202f% (the same rule applies each year the tenant stays).  \n\n\\[\nR_{24}=R_{12}\\times(1+\u0394_{2}) = 1{,}308 \\times 1.09 \\approx \\$1{,}425\\;/\\;month\n\\]\n\n* At the end of month\u202f24 the tenant decides to move out and gives the required 60\u2011day notice.\n\n---\n\n#### Step\u202f4 \u2013 Vacancy\u2011decontrol (Month\u202f24\u202f\u2192\u202fMonth\u202f25)\n\n**What the law does:**  \n\n1. **When the unit becomes vacant, the rent\u2011control ceiling is lifted for that specific unit.**  \n2. The landlord may **reset the \u201cbase rent\u201d** to **the current market rent** (or to a value that is not lower than the market rent).  \n3. After the reset, the unit is **no longer subject to rent\u2011control** for as long as the next tenant remains in place **unless the landlord voluntarily re\u2011enters the unit into the control program** (which most jurisdictions forbid for a set period, e.g., 5\u202fyears).\n\nApplying the numbers:\n\n* The market rent for a comparable unit at month\u202f24 is **$1,800** (as defined above).  \n* The landlord therefore **sets the new base rent** for the next tenant at **$1,800**.  \n* The vacancy\u2011decontrol rule allows **no \u201ccapped\u201d increase** from $1,425 to $1,800; the jump is a **one\u2011time reset**.\n\n**Result:** The next tenant pays **$1,800/month** from day\u202f1, i.e., a",
