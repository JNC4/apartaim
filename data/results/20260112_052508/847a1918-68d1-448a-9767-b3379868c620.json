      "unknown_model_response": "## The Long\u2011Term Impacts of Rent\u2011Control Policies on Housing Affordability  \n*(A neutral, evidence\u2011based overview)*  \n\n### 1.  What \u201crent control\u201d usually means  \n\n| Type of regulation | Typical features | Intended short\u2011run effect |\n|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Strict rent caps** (e.g., \u201chard\u201d rent control) | Rents frozen at a level set years earlier; often no \u201cvacancy decontrol.\u201d | Immediate rent reduction for existing tenants. |\n| **Moderate rent caps** (e.g., \u201csoft\u201d rent control, rent stabilization) | Rents may rise only by a fixed percentage or an index (inflation, operating costs). Vacancy decontrol or \u201cturnover\u201d allowances let landlords raise rents when a unit becomes vacant. | Smaller, phased rent relief; attempts to preserve incentives for landlords. |\n| **Hybrid designs** (e.g., \u201crent\u2011control with exemptions,\u201d \u201cinclusionary rent\u2011control\u201d) | Caps apply only to units built before a cut\u2011off date; new construction may be exempt; may require landlords to provide \u201caffordable\u201d units in exchange for higher rents elsewhere. | Targeted relief while protecting new supply. |\n\nThe evidence below refers mainly to **long\u2011run** outcomes (\u2265\u202f5\u201310\u202fyears after implementation), because short\u2011run effects are relatively straightforward (rent reductions for current tenants).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  The core mechanisms that drive long\u2011run outcomes  \n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical empirical signature |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| **Supply reduction** | Landlords convert rental units to condos, short\u2011term rentals, or otherwise withdraw them from the regulated market because expected returns fall. | \u2193 rental\u2011unit stock, \u2191 vacancy rates in the uncontrolled segment, higher market rents for new units. |\n| **Reduced new\u2011construction incentives** | Developers anticipate lower future rents on any units that will become regulated (often because the regulation is \u201cgrandfathered\u201d to apply indefinitely). | \u2193 permits for new rental buildings; shift toward market\u2011rate condos or office space. |\n| **Quality deterioration** | With lower cash flow, owners cut maintenance, upgrades, or energy\u2011efficiency investments. | \u2191 proportion of \u201csubstandard\u201d units; higher rates of pest problems, heating failures, etc. |\n| **Tenant turnover effects** | When a regulated unit becomes vacant, the landlord may raise the rent to market level (or to the allowed ceiling after a \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d). This creates a \u201clock\u2011in\u201d incentive for tenants to stay long\u2011term. | \u2191 average tenancy length; \u2193 mobility; potential \u201chousing scarcity\u201d for newcomers. |\n| **Distributional spillovers** | Rent caps protect current tenants (often low\u2011 or middle\u2011income) but can raise market rents for non\u2011regulated renters and for buyers seeking to purchase units. | \u2191 rent burden for those outside the protected pool; possible gentrification of adjacent neighborhoods. |\n| **Fiscal externalities** | Lower property\u2011tax revenues (if assessed on market value) and reduced landlord profits can affect local government budgets. | \u2193 tax base; municipalities may raise other fees or cut services. |\n\nThese mechanisms are **theoretically robust**, but their empirical magnitude varies widely across jurisdictions and policy designs.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

This created uncertainty about future rent\u2011regulation risk. | \u2022 **Permit filings for new multifamily rentals fell 45\u202f%** between 1994 and 2009 (the first 15\u202fyears after the ordinance). <br>\u2022 By 2018, the city was building **\u2248\u202f2,500** new rental units per year, compared with **\u2248\u202f4,600** in the early\u20111990s\u2014a **45\u202f% decline** in the *rate* of new rental construction. <br>\u2022 The share of *new* housing that was rental (vs. owner\u2011occupied) dropped from **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** in 1993 to **\u2248\u202f15\u202f%** by 2020. | \u2022 **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)**, *\u201cThe Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality: Evidence from San\u202fFrancisco,\u201d* **American Economic Review**. <br>\u2022 **San\u202fFrancisco Planning Department**, *Building Permits and Housing Production* (annual reports, 1994\u20112022). |\n| **Housing\u2011quality outcomes** | Landlords faced lower cash flow on controlled units, which reduced funds for routine maintenance and capital upgrades. The ordinance also limited the ability to raise rents to cover large\u2011scale retrofits (e.g., seismic retrofitting, energy\u2011efficiency upgrades). | \u2022 **Housing Quality Survey (HQ\u2011S) data** collected by the U.S. Census Bureau show that the *percentage of rent\u2011controlled units rated \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d* rose from **9\u202f% in 1995** to **22\u202f% in 2015**. <br>\u2022 A 2021 **San\u202fFrancisco Department of Building Inspection** audit of a random sample of 1,200 rent\u2011controlled apartments found: <br>\u2003\u2013 **38\u202f%** had at least one serious code violation (e.g., broken heating, pest infestation, leaky windows). <br>\u2003\u2013 The average time to bring a unit into compliance was **18\u202fmonths**, versus **7\u202fmonths** for non\u2011controlled units. <br>\u2022 **Gyourko, Saiz & Linneman (2020)** estimate a **\u2248\u202f7\u202f%** reduction in the average *interior condition score* (on a 0\u2011100 scale) for rent\u2011controlled units relative to comparable non\u2011controlled units, after controlling for neighborhood trends. | \u2022 **U.S. Census Bureau**, *Housing Quality Survey* (1995, 2005, 2015). <br>\u2022 **San\u202fFrancisco Department of Building Inspection**, *Annual Code\u2011Violation Report* (2021). <br>\u2022 **Gyourko, Saiz & Linneman (2020)**",

      "unknown_model_response": "### 1.  What \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d (or \u201cvacancy deregulation\u201d) actually does  \n\n| Step | What happens under a **vacancy\u2011decontrol** rule | What happens **without** it (the \u201chard\u2011cap\u201d case) |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Tenant leaves or is evicted** | The unit **exits** the rent\u2011controlled pool. The landlord may raise the rent to the **uncontrolled market level** (or to a ceiling set by a \u201cturnover\u201d formula). The new tenant pays the market rent. | The unit **remains** in the rent\u2011controlled pool. The landlord can only raise the rent by the small \u201callowable increase\u201d (often 2\u20113\u202f%\u202f/\u202fyr). The new tenant pays essentially the same rent the former tenant paid, plus a tiny adjustment. |\n| **2. Incentive to keep a tenant** | Because the landlord can recoup the \u201clost\u201d rent only when a vacancy occurs, the owner has a **moderate incentive** to retain a tenant (to avoid turnover costs) but also a **clear upside** when a vacancy does arise. | The landlord has a **strong \u201clock\u2011in\u201d incentive** to keep the tenant for as long as possible, because the only way to increase rent is the tiny annual adjustment. Turnover is costly (legal fees, vacancy loss) *and* does not unlock a higher rent. |\n| **3. Effect on the supply of rent\u2011controlled units** | Over time, a fraction of the regulated stock **\u201cphases out\u201d** as units turn over and become market\u2011rate. The regulated pool slowly shrinks, which can **relieve pressure** on landlords to cut maintenance. | The regulated pool is **sticky**; a large share of units stay forever under the cap, so the **overall rent\u2011controlled share stays high**. The longer the lock\u2011in, the larger the cumulative loss of revenue for owners, intensifying the other negative mechanisms (conversion, under\u2011maintenance). |\n| **4. Effect on new construction** | Developers see a **finite horizon** for rent\u2011control exposure (e.g., a unit built today will be \u201cexempt\u201d for a set number of years, then may become subject to the cap only after a turnover). The risk is lower, so the **disincentive to build rental housing is weaker**. | Developers anticipate that **any unit built before the exemption date will stay under the cap forever** (or for a very long time). The **expected lifetime net present value** of a rental project falls sharply, discouraging new rental construction. |\n\n**Why the absence matters**\n\n1. **Revenue lock\u2011in** \u2013 When a landlord cannot raise rent even after a tenant leaves, the *present value* of future cash flows collapses. Empirical work (e.g., *Diamond, McQuade & Qian 2019* for San\u202fFrancisco) shows that a **10\u202f% lower expected future rent** can cut the willingness to invest in a new rental building by roughly **15\u201120\u202f%**.  \n\n2. **Maintenance trade\u2011off** \u2013 With a permanently low cash flow, owners respond by **deferring repairs**. The \u201clock\u2011in\u201d creates a *permanent* shortfall, whereas \u201cturnover\u2011decontrol\u201d creates a *temporary* shortfall that can be recouped later, giving owners more reason to keep the property in decent shape.  \n\n3. **Conversion pressure** \u2013 The longer a unit stays under a hard cap, the more attractive it becomes to **convert to a non\u2011regulated use** (condo, short\u2011term rental, office). The conversion decision is a binary one: \u201cIs the rent I can collect under the cap lower than the market rent I could get after conversion?\u201d The absence of vacancy decontrol pushes the answer toward conversion sooner.  \n\n4. **Distributional dynamics** \u2013 Hard caps produce a **high\u2011income \u201clock\u2011in\u201d**: many long\u2011term tenants who originally qualified for protection (often low\u2011 or moderate\u2011income) stay in the unit even as their incomes rise, while newcomers\u2014especially low\u2011income households\u2014face a *scarcer* supply of affordable units and higher market rents.  \n\n---\n\n### 2.
