      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nIn most empirical studies, **rent\u2011control (or rent\u2011stabilization) policies tend to make housing *less affordable* for the overall market over the long run**, even though they can provide short\u2011term relief for a limited group of existing tenants. The mechanisms that drive that outcome are:\n\n1. **Supply\u2011side effects** \u2013 landlords build fewer new units, convert existing units to other uses, or withdraw units from the rental market.  \n2. **Quality\u2011side effects** \u2013 owners have less incentive (or ability) to maintain or upgrade units, leading to a gradual deterioration of the housing stock.  \n3. **Allocation inefficiencies** \u2013 rent\u2011controlled units become scarce, so they are often occupied by households that are not the \u201cmost in\u2011need,\u201d and they generate \u201cshadow markets\u201d (e.g., illegal sub\u2011letting, key\u2011money payments).  \n\nAt the same time, **rent control can produce short\u2011run benefits for the tenants who happen to live in controlled units** (lower rent, greater stability). The policy\u2019s net effect therefore depends on how you weight those short\u2011run gains against the longer\u2011run costs to the broader housing market.\n\nBelow is a deep dive into the evidence, the main theoretical arguments, the points of agreement among scholars, and the areas where the research is still unsettled.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical foundations\n\n| Mechanism | How it works (theory) | Expected long\u2011run impact on affordability |\n|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Reduced new construction** | Developers compare expected returns on a market\u2011rate building vs. a building that will be subject to rent caps. If expected after\u2011tax cash flows fall, the project becomes less attractive \u2192 fewer units built. | Fewer total units \u2192 upward pressure on market rents. |\n| **Conversion to other uses** | Owners may switch a rent\u2011controlled apartment to condos, short\u2011term rentals (Airbnb), or commercial space, where they can charge market rates. | Shrinks the supply of affordable rental units. |\n| **De\u2011investment in maintenance** | With capped rents, cash flow is tighter, making it harder to fund repairs or upgrades. Owners may postpone maintenance, leading to \u201chousing quality decay.\u201d | Deteriorating units become less desirable, prompting tenants to move out (often to market\u2011rate units). |\n| **Rent\u2011control \u201clock\u2011in\u201d** | Tenants who stay long enjoy rents far below market value. This creates *high vacancy costs* for landlords who cannot raise rents to cover new expenses. | Landlords may keep units vacant or withdraw them from the market, further reducing supply. |\n| **Search and matching inefficiencies** | Because rents are artificially low, demand exceeds supply. Tenants spend more time and resources searching, and \u201ckey\u2011money\u201d or illegal sub\u2011letting markets emerge. | The \u201caffordable\u201d units go to those who can navigate the system, not necessarily the poorest households. |\n| **Inter\u2011generational equity** | Rent control benefits current tenants but does not guarantee that future renters will have the same benefit. | Over time, the net welfare gain can become negative for society as a whole. |\n\nThese mechanisms are *not* mutually exclusive; they often operate together and reinforce each other.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
