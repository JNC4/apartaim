Participants are usually not required to give identifying information, and the transaction is cash\u2011free (often a voucher or gift\u2011card). | Lowers the barrier for people who might otherwise be reluctant to turn in weapons; also limits the ability to track who turned in what. |\n| 3.\u202fIncentive |\u202fA fixed monetary amount per weapon (e.g., $50\u2011$200) or a non\u2011cash voucher. Some programs pay more for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (handguns, assault\u2011style rifles). | Incentive size influences the number and type of guns collected, but higher pay does not automatically mean greater safety impact. |\n| 4.\u202fCollection & disposal |\u202fFirearms are taken to a secure location, rendered inoperable (by crushing, de\u2011serialising, or melting), and then stored or destroyed. | Guarantees that the surrendered guns cannot re\u2011enter the market. |\n| 5.\u202fData recording (optional) |\u202fSome jurisdictions record the make, model, caliber, and condition of each gun; others only tally totals. | Detailed data enable evaluation of whether \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons are being removed. |\n| 6.\u202fFollow\u2011up |\u202fFew programs conduct post\u2011event surveys or link the data to crime statistics. | Without follow\u2011up, it is hard to measure any causal effect on violence. |\n\n**Key design variations that affect outcomes**\n\n| Variation | Typical U.S. example | Potential impact |\n|-----------|----------------------|------------------|\n| **Voluntary vs. mandatory** | U.S. programs are almost always voluntary; Australia\u2019s 1996 \u201cNational Firearms Amnesty\u201d combined a voluntary buy\u2011back with a mandatory ban and registration. | Mandatory components (e.g., bans, registration) tend to have larger, more measurable effects than pure buy\u2011backs. |\n| **Scope (local vs. national)** | City\u2011level events in Chicago, Seattle, or New York. | Local programs may only affect a small fraction of the total gun supply; national programs can reach a larger share but are rarer. |\n| **Targeted incentives** | Seattle (2015) paid $100 for handguns, $50 for long guns. | Higher payouts for handguns can shift the mix of guns collected toward those most often used in homicide. |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events vs. recurring quarterly drives. | Repeated events can sustain public awareness and gradually reduce the pool of unwanted guns. |\n| **Integration with other policies** | Some U.S. cities pair buy\u2011backs with expanded background\u2011check outreach or safe\u2011storage education. | Complementary measures can amplify any modest benefits of the buy\u2011back itself. |\n\n---\n\n## What does the research say?\n\n### 1.

Some programs exclude certain categories (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles, antique weapons) or require the gun to be **unloaded** and **unregistered**. | Simpler logistics; avoids legal complications with restricted weapons. |\n| **Data collection** | Organizers often record make, model, caliber, and condition. Some programs also ask why the owner is surrendering the gun. | Provides a limited snapshot of the local gun stock; can be useful for research but is not a comprehensive inventory. |\n| **Follow\u2011up** | Rarely any.

Why the evidence is **not** definitive  \n\n| Issue | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **No randomised control** | Cities cannot ethically randomise a buy\u2011back, so we rely on quasi\u2011experimental designs (ITS, synthetic control). These designs can control for many confounders but cannot prove causality with the certainty of a randomized trial. |\n| **Concurrent interventions** | During 2009\u20112011 Chicago also rolled out several other crime\u2011reduction initiatives (e.g., \u201cOperation Safe Streets,\u201d expanded community policing, a city\u2011wide \u201cCease\u2011Fire\u201d campaign). Disentangling the buy\u2011back\u2019s specific contribution is statistically difficult. |\n| **Short observation window** | The reported declines fade after about 12\u201318\u202fmonths. Longer\u2011term data (2013\u20112022) show homicide and suicide rates returning to pre\u2011buy\u2011back levels, suggesting any effect was temporary. |\n| **Selection bias in surrendered guns** | The majority of surrendered firearms were **old, low\u2011quality handguns** (average age >\u202f20\u202fyears, many in poor",

Program architecture \u2013 what the city actually did\n\n| Phase | What happened on the ground | Why it mattered |\n|-------|----------------------------|----------------|\n| **Planning & partnership** | \u2022 The Seattle Police Department (SPD) partnered with the **Mayor\u2019s Office of Public Safety**, the **Washington State Department of Health**, local gun\u2011safety NGOs (e.g., **Seattle Gun Violence Prevention Project**), and two community\u2011based \u201cfaith\u2011and\u2011youth\u201d organizations. <br>\u2022 A steering committee met weekly for three months to decide the budget, location, outreach script, and data\u2011capture form. | Multi\u2011agency buy\u2011in gave the event political legitimacy, broadened the outreach network (faith groups reached people who might distrust police), and allowed the health department to track suicide\u2011related outcomes. |\n| **Funding & incentive design** | \u2022 The city allocated **$300,000** from its \u201cViolent Crime Reduction\u201d budget. <br>\u2022 Incentive schedule: **$100** per handgun, **$50** per long gun (rifle/shotgun). <br>\u2022 No \u201cextra\u201d bonus for assault\u2011style rifles; the goal was to keep the formula simple and transparent. | Paying **double** for handguns created a clear financial signal that those weapons were the priority. The fixed\u2011price model avoided the \u201cprice\u2011gouging\u201d criticism that sometimes follows per\u2011caliber or per\u2011model schemes. |\n| **Publicity & messaging** | \u2022 Press releases in local TV, radio, newspapers, and on the city\u2019s website. <br>\u2022 Targeted flyers in neighborhoods with the highest per\u2011capita homicide rates (South\u2011Seattle, Central District, Rainier Valley). <br>\u2022 Social\u2011media ads that said: \u201cTurn in any handgun \u2013 no questions asked, $100 cash voucher.\u201d <br>\u2022 Community\u2011leader briefings (e.g., pastors, youth\u2011sports coaches) to encourage participation among people who might be wary of police. | A **handgun\u2011specific tagline** made the purpose crystal\u2011clear; the phrase \u201cno questions asked\u201d reduced fear of legal repercussions, while the $100 figure was high enough to motivate people who owned a single, unwanted handgun. |\n| **Logistics & collection sites** | \u2022 Two main sites: the **North Precinct** (downtown) and a **community center in the Rainier Valley**. <br>\u2022 Each site staffed by 4\u20135 officers, a health\u2011department liaison, and two volunteers from the NGOs. <br>\u2022 Secure metal\u2011detector\u2011screened drop boxes for quick hand\u2011offs; a second \u201cprocessing\u201d table where a trained technician removed ammunition, de\u2011activated the firearm, and logged the make/model. | Multiple sites reduced travel barriers, and the community\u2011center location signaled that the event was not purely a police operation. The presence of a health liaison allowed immediate referral for mental\u2011health services if a participant showed distress. |\n| **Data capture** | \u2022 A short questionnaire (paper form, later digitised) collected: <br>\u2003\u2022 Date and location of drop <br>\u2003\u2022 Weapon type (handgun, rifle, shotgun) <br>\u2003\u2022 Caliber/gauge (optional) <br>\u2003\u2022 Condition (functional, broken, \u201cjunk\u201d) <br>\u2003\u2022 Whether the participant was a **first\u2011time turn\u2011in** (yes/no) <br>\u2022 No personal identifiers (name, address) were recorded, preserving anonymity. | Even without names, the aggregate data let the city analysts calculate the proportion of *handguns* versus *long guns* and see whether \u201cjunk\u201d weapons were being turned in (often the ones most likely to be used in crimes). |\n| **Incentive distribution** | \u2022 Participants received a **$100 Visa gift card** (handgun) or **$50 Visa gift card** (long gun) on the spot. <br>\u2022 Gift cards were pre\u2011printed with a unique serial number that was logged alongside the firearm data; this prevented double\u2011dipping. | Immediate cash\u2011equivalent payment reduced the temptation to walk away after the drop.
