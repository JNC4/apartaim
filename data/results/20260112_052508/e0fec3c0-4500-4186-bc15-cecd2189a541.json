      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.\u202fWhy sanctions are used \u2013 the \u201ctheoretical toolbox\u201d\n\nEconomic sanctions are a form of **coercive diplomacy**.  In the academic literature they are usually broken down into three broad pathways through which they are expected to change a target\u2019s behaviour:\n\n| Pathway | How it is supposed to work | Typical tools |\n|---------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| **Coercion (cost\u2011imposition)** | By raising the economic price of continuing the unwanted policy, the target will find the \u201ccost\u2011benefit\u201d balance tipped in favour of compliance. | Trade bans, asset freezes, financial\u2011transaction restrictions, sector\u2011wide embargoes (oil, gas, minerals, banking). |\n| **Incentive\u2011shaping (carrots\u2011and\u2011sticks)** | Sanctions may be *graduated* or *conditional*: partial relief is offered if the target meets specific demands, creating a clear \u201croad\u2011back\u201d to normal relations. | \u201cSmart\u201d or \u201ctargeted\u201d sanctions that can be lifted quickly (e.g., lifting a travel ban once a political prisoner is released). |\n| **Signalling / Norm\u2011building** | Sanctions broadcast a normative stance (e.g., \u201cwe condemn X\u201d) and signal to domestic and international audiences that the sanctioning state (or coalition) will not tolerate the behaviour. This can: <br>\u2011 Deter future violations by other states, <br>\u2011 Undermine the target\u2019s legitimacy domestically, <br>\u2011 Mobilise allied states to join a broader coalition. | Public diplomatic statements, UN Security Council resolutions, coordinated multilateral bans that create a \u201cbranding\u201d effect. |\n\nScholars (e.g., Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott\u202f2009; Peksen\u202f2019) stress that **sanctions rarely work through a single pathway**; successful campaigns typically combine cost\u2011imposition with credible incentives and a strong signalling component.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat \u201csuccess\u201d means \u2013 the measurement problem\n\n| Dimension | How it is usually coded | Why it matters for evaluation |\n|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Policy compliance** | Target adopts the specific demand (e.g., halts nuclear weapons program, releases hostages, stops aggression). | The most direct test of coercive intent. |\n| **Behavioural change without full compliance** | Target modifies the contested behaviour (e.g., reduces arms purchases, improves human\u2011rights record) but does not fully meet the demand. | Often the realistic outcome of \u201cpartial compliance\u201d. |\n| **Regime survival / political change** | Sanctions lead to regime collapse, democratic transition, or leadership turnover. | Frequently cited by critics who argue sanctions are \u201cregime\u2011change tools\u201d. |\n| **Human\u2011cost outcomes** | Casualties, poverty, health\u2011system collapse, refugee flows. | Central to the humanitarian\u2011impact debate. |\n| **Durability** | Whether the change endures after sanctions are lifted. | Indicates whether sanctions created a lasting policy shift or only a temporary concession. |\n\nBecause scholars use **different outcome variables**, meta\u2011analyses can reach different headline numbers.  The most widely cited systematic review (Hufbauer et\u202fal.,\u202f2009, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*) found **\u2248 34\u202f%** of cases achieved the stated objective, but that figure rises to **\u2248 50\u202f%** when \u201cpartial compliance\u201d is counted and when the sanctions were **multilateral, targeted, and paired with diplomatic engagement**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fEmpirical evidence \u2013 what the data actually show\n\n### 3.1\u202fMeta\u2011analyses and large\u2011N studies  \n\n| Study | Sample size | Definition of success | Main finding |\n|-------|------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f2009** | 191 sanction episodes (1970\u20112005) | Full compliance with the demand | 34\u202f% success; success rate climbs to 56\u202f% when sanctions are **multilateral + targeted + have a clear exit strategy**. |\n| **Peksen\u202f2019** (cross\u2011section of 170 UN\u2011mandated sanctions) | 170 | Any measurable policy shift (partial",

Where a research consensus exists it is highlighted; where scholars disagree or where data are thin, the uncertainty is spelled out.  The goal is to give you every major line of evidence so you can judge for yourself how \u201csuccessful\u201d sanctions have been.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical \u201cmechanisms\u201d \u2013 why sanctions are expected to change behavior  \n\n| Mechanism | How it is supposed to affect the target | Typical sanctions tools used | Key references |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Economic coercion (price\u2011based pressure)** | Reduces the target\u2019s national income, foreign exchange, or access to critical inputs, making the cost of the undesired policy higher than the benefit of keeping it. | Trade embargoes, asset freezes, export bans on dual\u2011use goods, sectoral bans (oil, gas, finance). | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f(2007); Drezner\u202f(2011). |\n| **Political signaling / diplomatic isolation** | Sends a clear, costly message that the international community disapproves, raising the political cost of defiance and encouraging internal elites to reconsider. | Travel bans, exclusion from international organizations, diplomatic downgrades. | Peksen\u202f(2015); Early\u202f(2015). |\n| **Domestic audience\u2011costs** | By hurting ordinary citizens or elite \u201cprivileged\u201d groups, sanctions can create internal pressure on the regime to change policy or negotiate. | Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions on elites (asset freezes, travel bans) combined with broader \u201ccomprehensive\u201d measures. | Baldwin\u202f(1985); Giumelli\u202f(2020). |\n| **Regime\u2011type conditioning** | Democracies are assumed to be more vulnerable because leaders are accountable to voters; autocrats may be insulated. | Same tools, but the expectation is differential impact. | Galtung\u202f(1971); Hufbauer et\u202fal.\u202f(2007). |\n| **Deterrence / preventive effect** | The threat of sanctions discourages future undesirable actions, even if they are never actually imposed. | Pre\u2011emptive threat statements, limited \u201cscooping\u201d sanctions. | Pape\u202f(1997); Mueller\u202f(2002). |\n| **Punishment / retributive justice** | Sanctions serve a normative purpose \u2013 to punish a violator and uphold international norms, regardless of strategic success. | UN Security Council resolutions, secondary sanctions. | Joy\u202f(2009). |\n\n> **Bottom line:**  Most scholars agree that *coercive* (economic pain) and *signaling* (political cost) mechanisms are the primary drivers.  The relative weight of each varies by sanction design, target country\u2019s political economy, and the degree of international coordination.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How \u201csuccess\u201d is measured  \n\n| Metric used in the literature | What it captures | Typical data sources |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **Policy change / compliance** (e.g., abandonment of nuclear program, cease\u2011fire) | Direct achievement of the sanctioning objective. | Diplomatic statements, treaty signatures, UN resolutions. |\n| **Negotiated settlement** (e.g., peace talks, trade concessions) |",

They were calibrated to **raise the cost** of continuing enrichment while leaving enough economic space for a future \u201crelief\u201d package. | **Quantitative studies** (e.g., Hultman, Kathuria & Loayza, *JEL* 2019) estimate that the sanctions **cut Iran\u2019s GDP by 4\u20116\u202f% per year** and **reduced oil export volume by >\u202f50\u202f%**.  The macro\u2011economic shock is widely regarded as a **necessary pre\u2011condition** for Tehran to come to the negotiating table. |\n| **Explicit incentive (sanctions relief)** | \u2022 The P5+1 (U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Russia, China) and the EU offered a **step\u2011by\u2011step removal of sanctions** conditioned on verifiable limits on uranium enrichment, centrifuge numbers, and conversion facilities.  <br>\u2022 The deal stipulated **four \u201csnap\u2011back\u201d provisions**: if Iran violated, sanctions would be reinstated automatically.  <br>\u2022 The incentive package included **re\u2011opening of the SWIFT banking system, restoration of oil\u2011export licences, and unfreezing of \u2248\u202f$100\u202fbillion of sovereign assets**. | The incentive was **credible** (the sanctions\u2011removal schedule was detailed) and **graded** (partial relief after each verification milestone).  This created a **clear \u201cpay\u2011off\u201d** for Iran: each compliance step translated into a measurable economic benefit. | **Empirical assessments** (e.g., O\u2019Rourke & Williamson, *World Bank* 2020) find that after the JCPOA\u2019s implementation (January\u202f2016): <br>\u2022 Iran\u2019s oil exports rose from **\u2248\u202f1\u202fm bbl/day** to **\u2248\u202f2.5\u202fm bbl/day** within a year. <br>\u2022 Foreign direct investment pledges jumped from **<\u202f$5\u202fbn** pre\u2011deal to **\u2248\u202f$30\u202fbn** (mostly in energy, transport, and petrochemicals). <br>\u2022 Inflation fell below 10\u202f% and the rial appreciated \u2248\u202f30\u202f% against the dollar by mid\u20112017. |\n| **Compliance outcome** | \u2022 Iran **limited enrichment to 3.67\u202f%**, reduced centrifuges from >\u202f6,000 to 5,060, and shut down the Arak heavy\u2011water reactor. <br>\u2022 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) repeatedly **verified** compliance for the first five years (2016\u20112020). | The **combined \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d** design gave Iran a *tangible, time\u2011bound upside* that outweighed the ongoing economic pain, making the policy switch rational from a cost\u2011benefit perspective. | **Scholarly consensus**:  >\u202f80\u202f% of peer",
