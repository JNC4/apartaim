      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control policies that **freeze or cap rents at a level below market price** tend to **lower the price that existing tenants pay in the short run** but **reduce the overall supply of affordable housing over the long run**.  The net effect on \u201chousing affordability\u201d (the share of income that households must spend on housing) therefore depends on three interacting forces:\n\n| Force | Typical direction under rent control | How it feeds into affordability |\n|-------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Direct rent\u2011price effect** | \u2193 rents for protected units | Improves affordability for those who stay in a controlled unit. |\n| **Supply\u2011side response** | \u2193 new construction, \u2191 conversion to non\u2011rental uses, \u2191 vacancy\u2011rate \u201cturnover\u201d costs | Shrinks the stock of units that can be offered at affordable prices, pushing demand to the uncontrolled market where rents rise. |\n| **Distributional effect** | Benefits current low\u2011income renters; harms future renters & owners | Gains are concentrated on a minority (current tenants), while the majority\u2014especially newcomers and low\u2011income renters who cannot secure a controlled unit\u2014face higher rents and fewer vacancies. |\n\nWhen the **supply\u2011side contraction outweighs the direct rent\u2011price benefit**, overall affordability declines.  In a handful of cases where rent control is **paired with strong supply incentives** (e.g., \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction protections combined with tax credits for new units), the negative supply shock can be mitigated, and the net impact on affordability can be neutral or modestly positive.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of how those forces work, what the data show, and where the scholarly debate still lies.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical mechanisms\n\n### 1.1. Price ceiling logic\n- **Standard textbook model** (e.g., *Mankiw, 2020*): A rent ceiling set below the market-clearing rent creates excess demand (a \u201cshortage\u201d) because landlords receive less revenue than they would at the market rate.\n- **Landlord response**:  \n  1. **Reduce quantity supplied** (build fewer new units, withdraw existing units from the rental market, convert to condos or commercial uses).  \n  2. **Cut costs** (lower maintenance, defer upgrades, reduce services).  \n  3. **Raise non\u2011rental income** (charge higher fees, increase parking/utility surcharges, or require longer lease terms).  \n\n### 1.2. \u201cSearch and matching\u201d effects\n- With fewer units available at the controlled price, **search times lengthen** and **matching frictions increase**. Empirical work (e.g., *Gyourko & Linneman, 1993*) shows that vacancy rates fall and turnover slows, which **raises the \u201ceffective rent\u201d** for those who eventually find a unit (they may have to pay higher moving costs or accept a smaller unit).\n\n### 1.3. \u201cDynamic efficiency\u201d and \u201cintergenerational equity\u201d\n- Rent control can **lock in low rents for a cohort of tenants** while **future cohorts face a scarcer, more expensive market**. This inter\u2011generational transfer of wealth is a central point of critique in the literature (e.g., *Arnold, 2015*).\n\n### 1.4. \u201cBehavioral and political economy\u201d channels\n- Rent\u2011controlled units often become **high\u2011value \u201cscarcity assets.\u201d** Tenants may stay longer than they would otherwise, leading to **lower mobility** (see *Sims, 2019*).  \n- **Political economy**: Rent\u2011control laws are typically popular with incumbent renters, creating a \u201cpolicy lock\u2011in\u201d that makes it difficult to adjust or repeal (e.g., *Schwartz, 2021*).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence \u2013 what the data actually show\n\n### 2.1. United States (city\u2011level case studies)\n\n| Study | Setting | Rent\u2011control design | Main findings (\u226510\u2011year horizon) |\n|-------|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Glaeser, Gyourko & Saks (2005)** | New York City (1970\u20112000) | Strict \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d (new tenants pay market rent) | Rent\u2011controlled apartments had **~30\u202f% lower rents** than market units, but **new construction fell",

The case that is most often cited in the academic and policy literature is **New\u202fYork City (NYC)**, where **rent\u2011stabilization** (a form of moderate rent control) has been paired\u2014since the 1970s\u2014with a suite of **incentives for new construction and for preserving affordable units**.  The experience of NYC illustrates both how the \u201csupply\u2011side\u201d levers can be calibrated and what the empirical record looks like after two to three decades of implementation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The policy mix in New\u202fYork City\n\n| Policy | How it works | Intended supply effect |\n|--------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Rent\u2011stabilization (1974\u2011present)** | Units built **before 1974** are subject to annual rent increases capped at the *Maximum Base Rent* (\u2248\u202f1\u202f%\u20132\u202f% per year, plus a \u201cvacancy bonus\u201d of up to 20\u202f% when a tenant moves out).  New units are **exempt** (they are \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrolled\u201d). | Keeps a core of existing units affordable while **leaving the market price signal intact for new construction**. |\n| **421\u2011a Tax Incentive (1971\u20112021, now replaced by \u201cAffordable Housing 4\u2011NYC\u201d)** | Developers of new residential projects that set aside a **percentage of units as affordable** (initially 20\u202f%\u201330\u202f% depending on location and project size) receive **property\u2011tax abatements for up to 25\u202fyears**.  The program was the nation\u2019s largest single\u2011family\u2011tax\u2011abatement scheme. | **Offsets the cost of building** in a high\u2011cost market, encouraging developers to add units that would otherwise be financially marginal. |\n| **Inclusionary Housing / Mandatory Affordability** | Zoning changes (e.g., \u201cMandatory Inclusionary Housing\u201d in 2016) require **a set share of affordable units** (typically 20\u202f%\u201330\u202f%) in any new development that exceeds a certain size, with **in\u2011kind** or **off\u2011site** alternatives. | Guarantees a pipeline of below\u2011market units **independent of rent\u2011control**. |\n| **Density Bonuses & Zoning Flexibility** | Developers who provide a higher share of affordable units can receive **additional floor\u2011area ratio (FAR) bonuses**, allowing more square\u2011feet to be built on the same lot. | Makes affordable\u2011unit provision **economically attractive** by increasing the total sellable/leaseable area. |\n| **Housing Maintenance & Rehabilitation Grants** | NYC\u2019s \u201cHousing Preservation and Development\u201d (HPD) department offers **low\u2011interest loans and grants** for repairing rent\u2011stabilized buildings, contingent on keeping rents within the stabilization formula. | Reduces the incentive for landlords to withdraw units from the rental market (e.g., by converting them to condos). |\n| **\u201cJust\u2011Cause\u201d Eviction & \u201cGood\u2011Cause\u201d Lease Termination (2019)** | Landlords can only evict rent\u2011stabilized tenants for a narrow set of reasons (non\u2011payment, illegal use, etc.). | Lowers turnover\u2011related \u201cvacancy bonuses,\u201d **capping the rent jump** that could otherwise erode affordability. |\n\n**Key point:** The rent\u2011control element (rent\u2011stabilization) **only applies to a pre\u20111974 stock**, which is a **fixed, relatively small share** of the total housing market (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of apartments in 2022).  By **exempting new construction** from rent caps and **offering powerful financial incentives** for developers to add affordable units, NYC attempted to **decouple the \u201cprice ceiling\u201d from the \u201cquantity\u201d decision**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The bonds are repayable from the affordable\u2011unit revenues over a 30\u2011year period.  <br>2. **Density Bonus** \u2013 Because the development delivered **55\u202f% of its units at \u2264\u202f80\u202f%\u202fAMI**, the city granted a **+20\u202f% FAR bonus** (the base zoning allowed 8\u202f FAR; the bonus raised it to 9.6\u202f FAR). This translated into **approximately 150 additional square\u2011feet per unit**, allowing the developer to increase the total floor area without acquiring extra land. <br>3. **Public\u2011Space Contribution** \u2013 The project set aside **5\u202f% of the site** for a new public plaza and a 1\u2011acre waterfront park (part of the East River waterfront revitalization).
