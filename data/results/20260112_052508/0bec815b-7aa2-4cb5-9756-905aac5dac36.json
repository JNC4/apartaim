At 8\u202fTWh per year, 0.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f\u2248\u202f0.8 deaths, which in practice means **less than one statistically attributable death per year**.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA modern 1\u202fGW coal power station is expected to be responsible for **on the order of a few\u2011hundred premature deaths each year**, whereas a comparable 1\u202fGW nuclear facility accounts for **well under a single death per year**. The disparity\u2014roughly **200\u202fto\u202f300 times**\u2014is a direct consequence of the vastly different health\u2011impact profiles of the two energy sources.",
