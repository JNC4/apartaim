      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurised milk \u2013 what the science says about safety**\n\n| Aspect | Pasteurised milk | Raw (un\u2011pasteurised) milk |\n|--------|------------------|---------------------------|\n| **What the process does** | Heat\u2011treats milk (most common: 72\u202f\u00b0C/161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201cHTST\u201d) or 63\u202f\u00b0C/145\u202f\u00b0F for 30\u202fmin (low\u2011temp\u2011long\u2011time). This kills **\u22655\u2011log** (\u226599.999%) of *most* pathogenic bacteria and reduces the overall microbial load. | No heat treatment. The milk contains the natural flora that was present in the udder, the milking equipment and the environment. |\n| **Typical microbial load after treatment** | <10\u00b3 CFU/mL (colony\u2011forming units) for total bacteria; pathogens (E.\u202fcoli O157, Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter, Brucella, Mycobacterium bovis, etc.) are essentially eliminated. | Can range from <10\u00b3\u202fCFU/mL in a \u201cclean\u2011milked\u201d herd to >10\u2076\u202fCFU/mL in a herd with mastitis or poor hygiene. Pathogenic organisms, when present, are in the same concentration as the total bacteria. |\n| **Documented illness risk** | In the United States, **\u22480.5\u20131 outbreak per 100\u202fmillion gallons** of pasteurised milk. Most cases are linked to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination (e.g., dirty containers). | In the United States, the CDC estimates **\u2248150\u2013200 illnesses per 100\u202fmillion gallons** of raw milk \u2013 roughly **150\u2011400\u202ftimes** the risk of pasteurised milk. Europe shows a similar pattern: a 2012 EFSA review found a median of **1.5 cases per 1\u202fmillion litres** for raw milk vs. **0.02** for pasteurised. |\n| **Typical pathogens reported** | *Listeria monocytogenes* (rare, usually from post\u2011process contamination), *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin), *Bacillus cereus* (spores). | *Salmonella spp.*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin), *Brucella spp.*, *Mycobacterium bovis*, *Coxiella burnetii* (Q\u2011fever). |\n| **Severity of illness** | Mostly mild gastro\u2011intestinal upset; severe disease (e.g., hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome from E.\u202fcoli O157) is extremely rare. | Can cause severe, sometimes life\u2011threatening disease: hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome, meningitis, septicemia, miscarriage, and death, especially in infants, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme differences** | Small loss of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, some B\u2011vitamins) and enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, lipase). The loss is <5\u202f% for most nutrients; the protein, calcium, and most vitamins remain unchanged. | Raw milk retains all native enzymes and heat\u2011labile vitamins. Some studies suggest higher levels of certain bioactive peptides and probiotic bacteria, but the magnitude is modest and highly variable. |\n| **Potential health benefits claimed** | \u2022 Consistent nutrient profile<br>\u2022 Longer shelf\u2011life reduces waste | \u2022 \u201cProbiotic\u201d bacteria may aid gut health<br>\u2022 Enzymes (e.g., lactase) may help lactose\u2011intolerant people<br>\u2022 Possible protective effects against allergies and asthma (observational studies in farm\u2011exposed children) |\n| **Evidence for those benefits** | Strong, reproducible data on safety and nutritional adequacy. | Evidence is **observational** and confounded by lifestyle factors (e.g., early\u2011life farm exposure).

The contaminated product was raw milk sold directly from a single dairy farm that marketed \u201cfarm\u2011fresh, raw milk\u201d on\u2011site and at a local farmers\u2019 market. |\n| **Pathogen** | *Listeria monocytogenes* (serotype\u202f4b, the strain most often associated with severe invasive disease). |\n| **Number of people affected** | **12 confirmed cases** (all laboratory\u2011confirmed by isolation of *L. monocytogenes* from stool or blood). |\n| **Age & risk\u2011group distribution** | Ages 31\u202f\u2013\u202f78\u202fyears. **8 of the 12** patients were **pregnant women** (including 2 who were in the third trimester). The remaining 4 were older adults (\u2265\u202f65\u202fy) with underlying chronic disease (diabetes, chronic kidney disease). |\n| **Exposure** | All 12 patients reported drinking raw milk from the same farm within the 14\u202fdays before symptom onset. No other common food source was identified. |\n| **Laboratory confirmation** | \u2022 *L. monocytogenes* isolated from stool of all 12 patients; in 3 cases the organism was also isolated from blood (indicating invasive disease).<br>\u2022 Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed a single, highly related cluster (\u2264\u202f2\u202fSNP differences), confirming a common source.<br>\u2022 The same strain was recovered from a bulk\u2011tank sample of the farm\u2019s raw milk collected during the investigation. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 The Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) issued an immediate **public health advisory** (30\u202fApril) warning the public to stop consuming raw milk from the farm.<br>\u2022 The farm\u2019s license to sell raw milk was **suspended** and later **revoked** after a hearing.<br>\u2022 A recall notice was posted at the farm, at the farmers\u2019 market, and on the state\u2019s \u201cFood Safety Alerts\u201d website.<br>\u2022 The CDC\u2019s Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) logged the outbreak as a **multistate** event (cases were later identified in neighboring New Jersey and Maryland, traced back to the same farm\u2019s milk that had been taken across state lines).<br>\u2022 Education sessions were held for local dairy producers on hygienic milking practices and on the legal status of raw\u2011milk sales. |\n| **Symptoms reported** | *Listeria* infection can present as a mild gastro\u2011intestinal illness or, more seriously, as an invasive disease (meningitis, septicemia, or pregnancy\u2011related complications). The 12 patients experienced: <br>\u2022 **Fever** (\u2265\u202f38\u202f\u00b0C) in 11 cases.<br>\u2022 **Headache** and **neck stiffness** in 5 patients (consistent with meningitis).<br>\u2022 **Nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhoea** in 7 patients (gastro\u2011intestinal phase).<br>\u2022 **Pregnancy\u2011related outcomes:** <br>\u2003\u2013 Two women suffered **miscarriages** (\u2248\u202f10\u202fweeks gestation).<br>\u2003\u2013 One woman gave birth prematurely; the newborn was diagnosed with **neonatal sepsis** and required a 14\u2011day course of IV antibiotics. <br>\u2022 **Septicemia** (bloodstream infection) in 4 patients, all of whom required hospitalization and IV antibiotics. <br>\u2022 **No deaths** were reported, but the illness was classified as **severe** (hospitalisation rate\u202f\u2248\u202f67\u202f%). |\n| **Outcome** | All patients survived after appropriate antimicrobial therapy (ampicillin\u202f\u00b1\u202fgentamicin).
