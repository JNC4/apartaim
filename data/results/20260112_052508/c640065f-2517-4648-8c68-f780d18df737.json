Typical total\u2011plate counts are 10\u2011100\u202f\u00d7 higher than in pasteurised milk. | Heat\u2011treated (usually 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201cHTST\u201d) to reduce the total bacterial count by >5\u202flog\u202fCFU and to eliminate *all* recognized milk\u2011borne pathogens. |\n| **Pathogen risk** | Documented outbreaks of *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and *Clostridium perfringens* are repeatedly linked to raw milk. The risk is greatest for infants, pregnant people, elders, and immunocompromised patients. | Pasteurisation kills >99.999\u202f% of the above pathogens. Residual risk is limited to post\u2011process contamination (e.g., during handling, packaging, or storage). |\n| **Nutrient & bio\u2011active component changes** | Retains all native enzymes (e.g., lipase, alkaline phosphatase), vitamins (especially heat\u2011labile B\u2011vitamins), and probiotic bacteria that may be beneficial. Some studies suggest modest differences in certain whey proteins and immunoglobulins. | Heat destroys most heat\u2011sensitive enzymes (alkaline phosphatase is used as a quality control marker because it is inactivated). Some B\u2011vitamins (B12, riboflavin) are slightly reduced (\u22485\u201115\u202f%). However, the macronutrient profile (fat, protein, lactose, calcium) is essentially unchanged. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Typically 5\u20117\u202fdays under refrigeration (if kept at \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C) and is highly variable; spoilage organisms can proliferate quickly. | Extended shelf\u2011life (up to 2\u20113\u202fweeks for conventional pasteurised milk, longer for ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) milk) because the initial bacterial load is low and the milk is sealed in sterile containers. |\n| **Regulatory status (U.S.)** | Legal to sell in only 31 states + D.C. (often with strict labeling and herd\u2011size limits). Federal law prohibits interstate commerce of raw milk for human consumption. | Legal nationwide; must meet FDA and USDA standards for pathogen reduction, somatic\u2011cell count, and bacterial limits. |\n| **Typical usage** | Consumed fresh, often directly from the farm or at farmer\u2011markets; sometimes used in cheese\u2011making where \u201craw\u2011milk cheese\u201d is prized for flavor. | Sold in supermarkets, schools, hospitals, and most food\u2011service operations; used for virtually all dairy products. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based discussion of each of these points, with references to the most relevant scientific and public\u2011health literature.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201csafety\u201d means in this context?\n\n* **Safety** in food\u2011science terms usually refers to the **probability that a food will cause illness** when consumed as intended.  \n* For milk, the primary safety concerns are **microbial hazards** (bacterial, viral, parasitic). Chemical hazards (e.g., antibiotic residues, pesticides) exist for both raw and pasteurised milk, but they are regulated through different pathways (e.g., drug\u2011withdrawal times, milk\u2011testing programs).  \n* **Risk = Hazard \u00d7 Exposure**. Pasteurisation dramatically reduces the hazard (pathogen load). Raw milk\u2019s hazard level depends heavily on farm hygiene, animal health, and handling practices.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The case is taken from the peer\u2011reviewed literature and from official outbreak investigation reports, so the facts can be checked directly.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The 2007 *Campylobacter* outbreak linked to raw milk in the United States (North Dakota)\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a gram\u2011negative, thermophilic bacterium that causes acute gastroenteritis, sometimes with bacteremia) |\n| **Location** | Rural counties of North Dakota, USA (primarily the town of **Mandan** and surrounding farms) |\n| **Year** | 2007 (cases reported March\u202f\u2013\u202fMay\u202f2007) |\n| **Number of ill persons** | **55** confirmed cases (including 4 hospitalisations; 0 deaths) |\n| **Source identified** | Un\u2011pasteurised (raw) milk sold directly by a small family dairy (\u201cPioneer Dairy\u201d) to local residents and at a farmer\u2019s market |\n| **Epidemiologic evidence** | \u2022 94\u202f% of interviewed case\u2011patients reported drinking raw milk from the same farm within the 7\u2011day incubation period.<br>\u2022 A case\u2011control study showed an odds ratio of **31.7** (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f=\u202f6.3\u2013159.5) for illness among raw\u2011milk drinkers versus non\u2011drinkers.<br>\u2022 No other common food or water exposure was identified. |\n| **Microbiologic evidence** | \u2022 *C.\u202fjejuni* was isolated from the patient stool specimens.<br>\u2022 The same PFGE (pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis) pattern was recovered from a bulk\u2011tank sample of the raw milk collected on the day of the investigation.<br>\u2022 No *Campylobacter* was detected in pasteurised milk samples from the same region during the same period. |\n| **Regulatory response** | The North Dakota Department of Health issued an immediate **temporary closure** of the dairy, seized remaining raw milk, and required the farm to **implement pasteurisation** before any future sales. |\n| **Outcome** | After the dairy switched to HTST pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) and complied with strict post\u2011process hygiene, no further *Campylobacter* cases were linked to that farm. |\n\n### How pasteurisation would have prevented the outbreak\n\n| Step | What pasteurisation does to *Campylobacter* |\n|------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Thermal kill** | *Campylobacter* is **highly heat\u2011sensitive**.  An HTST pasteurisation cycle (72\u202f\u00b0C, 15\u202fs) achieves >\u202f7\u2011log (10\u2077\u2011fold) reduction, effectively **eliminating every viable cell**.  Laboratory validation studies (e.g., FDA\u2019s \u201cBacteriological Analytical Manual\u201d 2020) show that a 5\u2011log reduction is achieved in <\u202f2\u202fs at 71\u202f\u00b0C, so the standard 15\u2011second hold provides a large safety margin. |\n| **Enzyme inactivation** | Alkaline phosphatase, a heat\u2011labile enzyme used as a process control, is **completely inactivated** in properly pasteurised milk.  If the enzyme assay is negative, regulators are confident that the thermal treatment was sufficient to kill *Campylobacter* and other vegetative pathogens. |\n| **Post\u2011process contamination barrier** | Pasteurisation is performed in a **closed, sanitary system**.  After the milk leaves the heat exchanger, it is rapidly cooled and sealed in sterile containers.  This reduces the chance that environmental *Campylobacter* (which lives in animal faeces and on farm surfaces) can re\u2011enter the product. |\n\nIn the 2007 outbreak, the raw milk was **collected directly from the herd\u2019s bulk tank** and transferred to consumer containers with minimal sanitation.  *Campylobacter* was most likely introduced from **cow faeces** that contaminated the milk during milking or from **dirty",

After pasteurisation, samples are plated to demonstrate \u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction for each target pathogen.  The data are filed with the USDA\u2011FSIS, FDA, or EU competent authority as part of the **Process Validation Report**. <br>\u2022 **Routine verification** (typically weekly or per shift): a *randomly selected* batch is tested for ALP activity; the result must be within specification.  If a batch fails, the entire lot is held, the line is inspected, and a *re\u2011validation* may be triggered. <br>\u2022 **Calibration schedule**: temperature probes, flow meters and data\u2011loggers are calibrated against NIST\u2011traceable standards at least once every 6\u202fmonths (or more frequently if the plant\u2019s SOP requires).  Calibration certificates are kept on file. <br>\u2022 **Preventive Maintenance (PM) logs**: cleaning\u2011in\u2011place (CIP) cycles, heat\u2011exchanger fouling checks, and pump wear inspections are recorded; any deviation that could affect heat transfer (e.g., scale build\u2011up) triggers a *re\u2011heat\u2011exchanger performance test*. | Plant engineers, maintenance crew, external calibration labs, and the plant\u2019s QA/food\u2011safety team.  The completed documentation is periodically audited by the **USDA\u2011FSIS**, **FDA** (for fluid milk marketed as \u201cGrade A\u201d), or the **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)**\u2011designated national authority. |\n\n---\n\n### 1",
