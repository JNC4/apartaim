The theory draws on rational\u2011choice models of state behavior and on \u201ccoercive diplomacy\u201d (e.g., Alexander\u202f1979; Pape\u202f1997). | How much of the pressure is actually felt by the **decision\u2011makers** versus the broader populace is still contested, especially for *targeted* (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions that aim at elites and specific sectors. |\n| **Success rates (overall)** | The most frequently quoted meta\u2011analysis is **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*.

A later update by **Hufbauer et\u202fal. (2020)**, adding post\u20112005 cases, puts the figure at **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%**.  The authors note that \u201csuccess\u201d is defined by the *initiating* state\u2019s own assessment, which can be generous. | Success rates vary dramatically by **type of goal** (policy reversal vs. regime change), **level of multilateral support**, and **target country\u2019s economic structure**.  Because each study uses a different coding scheme, exact percentages differ (some scholars report 20\u201140\u202f% for \u201ccoercive\u201d goals). |\n| **Policy\u2011change vs. regime\u2011change** | - **Policy\u2011change (e.g., nuclear\u2011program abandonment, cease\u2011fire, trade concessions)**: success is higher, especially when sanctions are **multilateral**, **targeted**, and **paired with diplomatic incentives**.  UN\u2011mandated sanctions on South Africa (apartheid), Libya (Gaddafi\u2019s weapons program), and Iran (JCPOA\u2011related) are often cited as successes. <br>- **Regime\u2011change (toppling a government)**: the evidence is overwhelmingly negative.  **Pape (1997)** argued that *no* sanctions have forced a regime to fall; later work (e.g., **Hufbauer\u202fet",

The more partners that joined, the higher the *opportunity cost* for the regime. |\n| **Targeting strategy** | \u2022 **Sector\u2011specific** (strategic minerals, oil, arms). <br>\u2022 **Financial** (blocking new credit lines, restricting access to international banking). <br>\u2022 **Investment** (forcing firms to divest). <br>\u2022 **Symbolic** (sports & cultural isolation). | By focusing on **high\u2011value, high\u2011visibility sectors**, the sanctions hit the elite\u2019s revenue streams while avoiding a blanket embargo that would have caused massive civilian hardship and could have generated a \u201crally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag\u201d effect. |\n| **Domestic political context** | \u2022 Growing internal resistance (e.g., United Democratic Front, trade\u2011union strikes). <br>\u2022 Economic recession: oil\u2011price shock (1979\u201180), falling commodity prices, rising debt. <br>\u2022 A split within the ruling National Party between hard\u2011liners and reformers (e.g., F.\u202fW.\u202fde\u202fKlerk). | Sanctions **exacerbated** pre\u2011existing economic stress, making the cost of maintaining apartheid *politically untenable* for reform\u2011oriented elites. |\n| **Outcome** | 1990 \u2013 President F.\u202fW.\u202fde\u202fKlerk announced the unbanning of the African National Congress (ANC) and the release of Nelson Mandela; a negotiated transition began, culminating in the 1994 democratic elections. | The *policy change* (dismantling apartheid) matched the explicit goal of the sanctioning coalition.

The target was a **policy\u2011change** rather than outright regime\u2011change. | The goal was clearly articulated in UN Security Council Resolutions 418 (1977) and 591 (1986) and in the broader diplomatic discourse of the anti\u2011apartheid movement. |\n| **Sanction instruments** | 1. **Comprehensive arms embargo** (Resolution\u202f418, 1977). <br>2. **Trade embargoes** on key commodities (e.g., gold, diamonds, coal, iron ore) imposed by the EU, the United States, and many Commonwealth countries. <br>3. **Financial restrictions** \u2013 prohibition on new loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, plus a ban on South African securities on major exchanges. <br>4. **Cultural and sporting boycotts** (e.g., exclusion from the Olympics, international cricket). | The mix of **macro\u2011economic pressure** (loss of export revenue, reduced foreign financing) and **soft\u2011power pressure** (loss of prestige, isolation of elite social circles) hit both the state\u2019s budget and the ruling white minority\u2019s personal interests. |\n| **Multilateral nature** | \u2022 **UN Security Council** resolution gave the sanctions a legal \u201cglobal\u201d seal. <br>\u2022 **European Economic Community (EEC)**, **United States**, **Canada**, **Australia**, **New\u202fZealand**, and most **African** and **Latin\u2011American** states voluntarily adopted parallel measures, creating a near\u2011worldwide embargo. | The breadth limited \u201csanction\u2011shopping\u201d (i.e., the South African government could not simply turn to a single friendly country for trade or finance).  Studies (e.g., **Galtung\u202f&\u202fRuge\u202f1977**, **Mack\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2007**) show that *multilateral* sanctions are roughly **twice as likely** to achieve their aims as unilateral ones. |\n| **Targeted vs. comprehensive** | While some measures were **targeted** (e.g., bans on specific individuals, arms embargo), most were **comprehensive** (broad trade bans).  The combination mattered: the comprehensive trade embargo hurt the macro\u2011economy, while the targeted elite sanctions (travel bans, asset freezes) created internal dissent among the white minority. | Scholars such as **Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal. (2007)** argue that \u201c**smart**\u201d sanctions work best when they are **paired with broader economic pressure**, because elite pressure alone may be insufficient if the state can absorb short\u2011term losses. |\n| **Domestic political context** | \u2022 By the mid\u20111980s, South Africa faced **mass internal protests**, **labour strikes**, and **state\u2011repressed violence**. <br>\u2022 The **economic recession** (GDP fell ~\u202f5\u202f% per year 1985\u201189) eroded the fiscal capacity of the apartheid regime. <br>\u2022 White business leaders (e.g., the **South African Chamber of Commerce**) began publicly lobbying for reform because sanctions threatened their profits and international standing. | The sanctions **amplified pre\u2011existing internal pressures**.  When external costs rise, elites become more willing to negotiate (the \u201celite\u2011cost\u201d channel identified in **Pape\u202f(1997)** and later refined by **Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal. (2020)**). |\n| **Diplomatic \u201ccarrot\u201d** | Parallel to sanctions, the **British Commonwealth** and **U.S.** governments offered **incentives** for reform: the prospect of **re\u2011entry into the global financial system**, lifting of trade bans, and eventual **membership in the Commonwealth of Nations**. | The combination of **coercion + inducement** (the classic \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d approach) is repeatedly found to increase success odds (see **Baker\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f199",
