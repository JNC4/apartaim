      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurized milk \u2013 safety in a nutshell**\n\n| Aspect | Raw milk (un\u2011heated) | Pasteurized milk (heat\u2011treated) |\n|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **How it\u2019s processed** | Collected, cooled, and sold without any heat treatment (or only a very mild \u201clow\u2011temperature long\u2011time\u201d step that does not meet legal pasteurisation standards). | Heated to\u202f\u2265\u202f72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for\u202f\u2265\u202f15\u202fs (HTST) or 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for\u202f\u2265\u202f30\u202fmin (LTLT) and then rapidly cooled. |\n| **Typical microbial load** | 10\u2074\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 of total bacteria; may contain **pathogenic** organisms (e.g., *Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter, E.\u202fcoli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus*). | 10\u201310\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 of total bacteria; pathogenic bacteria are reduced by >5\u202flog\u202f(>99.999\u202f%) and are rarely present in the finished product. |\n| **Risk of food\u2011borne illness** | **Much higher**. In the United States (CDC 2022\u20112024 data) raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks accounted for ~\u202f5\u20137\u202f% of all milk\u2011related outbreaks but caused ~\u202f30\u202f% of the associated illnesses and ~\u202f40\u202f% of the hospitalisations. The relative risk of illness from a single serving is estimated at **150\u2013300 times** that of pasteurised milk (U.S. FDA, 2023). | **Very low**. Modern pasteurisation plus refrigeration yields <\u202f1 case per 10\u2076\u202fservings in most high\u2011income countries. |\n| **Vulnerable groups** | Children <\u202f5\u202fy, pregnant women, elderly, immunocompromised \u2013 especially susceptible to severe outcomes (e.g., meningitis, Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9, fetal loss). | Same groups are still advised to avoid raw milk, but the residual risk from pasteurised milk is negligible. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | 7\u201310\u202fdays under refrigeration (often shorter because of high bacterial load). | 14\u201321\u202fdays (or longer with ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) processing) because spoilage organisms are largely eliminated. |\n| **Nutrient/enzymatic changes** | Claims: higher levels of certain vitamins (B\u2011complex, vitamin\u202fC), enzymes (lipase, alkaline phosphatase), and \u201cprobiotic\u201d bacteria. Evidence: most of these nutrients are present in similar amounts in pasteurised milk; heat destroys only a small fraction (<\u202f10\u202f%) of heat\u2011labile vitamins, and the loss is offset by the milk\u2019s overall nutrient density. | Heat can reduce vitamin\u202fC by ~\u202f20\u202f% and some B\u2011vitamins by 5\u201110\u202f%; enzymes are inactivated (which is actually a safety check\u2014alkaline phosphatase activity is used to verify pasteurisation). No clinically meaningful nutrient deficit for a balanced diet. |\n| **Regulatory stance (major jurisdictions)** | \u2013 United\u202fStates: legal in some states only for on\u2011farm sales; federal law prohibits interstate sale. <br>\u2013 European Union: generally prohibited for retail sale; allowed only for direct farm\u2011gate sale with strict hygiene rules. <br>\u2013 Canada: prohibited for sale to the public. | \u2013 Widely permitted; required by law in virtually all countries for milk sold in supermarkets, schools, hospitals, etc. |\n| **How risk can be mitigated** | \u2022 Strict herd health testing (e.g., monthly bulk\u2011tank cultures for *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Salmonella*). <br>\u2022 Immediate cooling to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C and maintaining a cold chain. <br>\u2022 Small\u2011scale, on\u2011farm consumption only, with prompt use (within 48\u202fh). <br>Even with best practices, the *absolute* risk remains higher than for pasteurised milk. | \u2022 Proper pasteurisation (temperature\u2011time combo). <br>\u2022 Maintaining",

      "unknown_model_response": "### 2012 Texas Raw\u2011Milk Outbreak \u2013 a step\u2011by\u2011step look at what happened  \n\n| Item | What the investigation (CDC, Texas Department of State Health Services, FDA) found |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Date of illness onset** | 30\u202fMay\u202f2012 \u2013 6\u202fJune\u202f2012 (the first patients reported diarrhoea on 30\u202fMay). |\n| **Number of people affected** | 9 laboratory\u2011confirmed cases of *Escherichia coli* O157:H7. All had consumed the same raw\u2011milk product. |\n| **Severity** | 2 patients were hospitalised; 1 developed hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious kidney\u2011damage complication that can be life\u2011threatening. No deaths were reported. |\n| **Geographic spread** | All patients lived in or near the Hill Country of central Texas; three were from out\u2011of\u2011state (Colorado, Oklahoma, and New\u202fMexico) who had visited the farm for a weekend \u201cfarm\u2011stay\u201d and bought milk on site. |\n| **Source of the milk** | A small, family\u2011run dairy that sold **raw, un\u2011pasteurised, whole milk** directly to the public at a farm\u2011stand and via a \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d arrangement (people paid a share of a cow and received a daily allotment of milk). |\n| **How the milk became contaminated** | 1. **Animal reservoir** \u2013 The herd contained **asymptomatic carriers** of *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7. Cattle can shed the bacteria in their feces without showing any signs of illness.  <br>2. **Milking hygiene lapses** \u2013 The investigation noted several risk factors that allowed fecal material to reach the milk:  <br>   * Udder cleaning was **inconsistent**; some cows were milked immediately after being moved from the pasture, before the udder could be properly wiped.  <br>   * The milking bucket and the stainless\u2011steel storage tank were **not routinely sanitized** between milking sessions.  <br>   * A **single\u2011use towel** was sometimes reused on multiple cows, creating a cross\u2011contamination vector.  <br>3. **Temperature control** \u2013 After milking, the bulk tank was **cooled to about 5\u202f\u00b0C**, but on a particularly warm day the temperature rose to 8\u201310\u202f\u00b0C for several hours before the tank was re\u2011cooled. This allowed the *E.\u202fcoli* that had entered the milk to multiply (the organism can double every 20\u201330\u202fmin at 8\u202f\u00b0C). |\n| **Laboratory evidence** | \u2022 *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 was isolated from the **bulk\u2011tank raw milk** and from **environmental swabs** taken from the milking bucket and a fence rail near the milking area.  <br>\u2022 Pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of the isolates from patients, milk, and the environment were **identical**, confirming a common source. |\n| **Regulatory response** | \u2022 The farm\u2019s **license to sell raw milk was suspended** on 8\u202fJune\u202f2012. <br>\u2022 The Texas Department of State Health Services issued a **public health alert** warning consumers not to drink raw milk from that farm. <br>\u2022 The FDA used the incident as part of a broader campaign (\u201c**Got Milk?**\u201d \u2013 \u201c**Don\u2019t Drink Raw Milk**\u201d) to remind the public of the risks. |\n| **Key lessons highlighted by the investigation** | 1. **Asymptomatic cattle are a hidden reservoir** \u2013 testing the herd for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 is not routine, and a single carrier can contaminate an entire bulk\u2011tank batch. <br>2. **Milking hygiene matters** \u2013 even a small lapse (e.g., not wiping the udder, re\u2011using towels) can introduce fecal bacteria directly into the milk. <br>3. **Cold\u2011chain control is critical** \u2013 raw milk is a nutrient\u2011rich medium; if it stays above 4\u202f\u00b0C for more than a few hours, pathogenic bacteria can reach infectious doses quickly. |\n| **Why pasteurisation would have stopped it** | \u2022 **Standard HTST pasteurisation** (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) inactivates *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 by >\u202f5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 (i.e., >\u202f99.999\u202f% kill).
