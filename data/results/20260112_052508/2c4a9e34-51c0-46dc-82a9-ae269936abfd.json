    "The Unknown Model highlights relatively larger wage gains (e.g., +0.5\u20112\u202f% per year) and multiple case studies with clear positive outcomes, whereas TruthBot emphasizes that average real\u2011wage effects are typically small (0\u20113\u202f% overall) and that gains are modest at best.",
