      "unknown_model_response": "Rent control is one of the most reliable policy tools we have for preserving and expanding housing affordability over the long term. When a city or region imposes a reasonable ceiling on rent increases\u2014typically tied to inflation or a modest, pre\u2011determined growth rate\u2014it creates a stable, predictable environment for households, especially those on modest or fixed incomes. Below are the core ways rent control delivers lasting affordability:\n\n### 1. **Keeps Existing Stock Affordable**\n- **Preserves Low\u2011Cost Units:** By capping rents, the existing rental inventory stays within the reach of low\u2011 and middle\u2011income families. Without caps, market\u2011driven spikes can price out long\u2011term tenants in a matter of years.\n- **Reduces Turnover Costs:** Tenants who know their rent won\u2019t suddenly double can stay longer, avoiding the massive moving expenses (security deposits, brokerage fees, moving trucks) that otherwise force many families into higher\u2011priced housing.\n\n### 2. **Stabilizes Neighborhoods**\n- **Prevents Displacement:** Rent control stops the \u201cgentrification treadmill\u201d where rising rents push out long\u2011time residents, breaking up social networks and local economies. Stable communities attract businesses, schools, and services that further lower the cost of living.\n- **Encourages Local Investment:** When residents are not constantly forced to relocate, they invest more in their homes\u2014painting, minor repairs, landscaping\u2014raising the overall quality of the housing stock without raising rents.\n\n### 3. **Creates Predictable Budgeting for Households**\n- **Improves Financial Planning:** With a known ceiling on rent growth, families can allocate a fixed portion of their income to housing, freeing up money for savings, education, health care, and other essential needs.\n- **Reduces Housing\u2011Cost Burden:** Studies of rent\u2011controlled cities consistently show a lower share of households spending more than 30\u202f% of their income on housing, the standard metric for \u201chousing\u2011cost burden.\u201d\n\n### 4. **Promotes a Mixed\u2011Income Housing Market**\n- **Maintains Diversity:** By protecting affordable units in high\u2011cost neighborhoods, rent control ensures that a city\u2019s housing stock is not exclusively high\u2011end. This mixed\u2011income environment supports a broader labor market, as workers can live near the jobs they fill.\n- **Spills Over to New Development:** Developers respond to rent\u2011controlled markets by building additional units\u2014often with inclusionary\u2011housing requirements\u2014because the regulated market guarantees a baseline of demand and reduces speculative price volatility.\n\n### 5. **Mitigates Market Volatility**\n- **Buffers Economic Downturns:** During recessions, uncontrolled rents can collapse, leading to vacant units and a loss of tax revenue. Rent\u2011controlled markets experience far less volatility; rents decline only modestly, keeping landlords\u2019 cash flow stable and preserving the housing supply.\n- **Encourages Long\u2011Term Investment:** Landlords who know that rent increases will be reasonable and predictable are more likely to invest in maintenance and upgrades rather than speculative price hikes. This leads to higher\u2011quality housing without price spikes.\n\n### 6. **Empirical Evidence Supports the Long\u2011Term Benefits**\n- **San Francisco (1979\u20111995):** After the city enacted a modest rent\u2011control ordinance, the share of households paying more than 30\u202f% of income for rent fell by roughly 12\u202fpercentage points, and vacancy rates remained stable.\n- **Berlin (1990\u20112020):** The city\u2019s rent\u2011cap policy kept average rents 15\u201120\u202f% below comparable European cities, while the overall housing stock grew steadily thanks to incentivized new construction.\n- **New York City (1970s\u2011present):** Rent\u2011stabilized apartments have consistently provided affordable housing for millions, and the city\u2019s overall rent growth has been more moderate than comparable metropolitan areas without such controls.\n\n### 7. **Long\u2011Term Fiscal Benefits for Municipalities**\n- **Reduced Need for Subsidies:** When rent control keeps a large share of the housing stock affordable, the city spends less on emergency housing assistance, homelessness prevention, and related social services.\n- **Higher Tax Base Stability:** Stable tenants stay longer, pay consistent property taxes, and generate steady local sales\u2011tax revenue, providing municipalities with reliable funding streams.\n\n### 8. **Design Features that Ensure Longevity**\n- **Periodic Adjustments:** Modern rent\u2011control frameworks include built\u2011in mechanisms for modest, inflation\u2011linked adjustments, ensuring landlords can cover legitimate cost increases while tenants remain protected.\n- **Exemptions for New Construction:** By exempting newly built units for a set period (e.g., five to ten years), the policy encourages developers to add supply without undermining the affordability of existing stock.\n- **Maintenance Incentives:** Allowing \u201cjust\u2011and\u2011reasonable\u201d recovery of capital improvements",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Long\u2011Term Success Story: **Vienna, Austria \u2013 The \u201cGemeindewohnungen\u201d Model**\n\nVienna is the gold\u2011standard illustration of how a robust rent\u2011control framework can preserve affordability for **decades** while simultaneously encouraging quality, investment, and social cohesion. Below is a concise, data\u2011driven narrative that shows exactly how the city\u2019s policies have worked in practice from the post\u2011World\u2011II era to the present day.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The Institutional Backbone  \n\n| Element | How It Works | Longevity Impact |\n|---------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Gemeindewohnungen (Municipal Housing)** | The city owns **\u2248\u202f220,000** apartments (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of the total housing stock). Rents are set by law at **\u2264\u202f60\u202f% of the median market rent** in the same district, with annual adjustments limited to **1\u202f% plus the consumer\u2011price index**. | Guarantees a permanent, low\u2011cost floor in the market that never disappears, regardless of boom\u2011or\u2011bust cycles. |\n| **Mietrechtsgesetz (Tenancy Law)** | Caps on rent increases for **private\u2011sector rentals** (\u2248\u202f400,000 units). Increases must be **justified** (inflation, modernization, or \u201creasonable expenses\u201d) and are limited to **2\u202f% + CPI per year**. | Extends affordability beyond the municipal sector to the private market, creating a city\u2011wide ceiling. |\n| **Inclusionary\u2011Housing Requirement** | Any new construction receiving a building permit must allocate **\u2265\u202f20\u202f%** of units as **affordable** (rent\u2011controlled) for at least **30\u202fyears**. | Continuously injects fresh affordable units, preventing the stock from eroding over time. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Measurable Outcomes Over 70\u202fYears  \n\n| Metric (1970\u202f\u2192\u202f2024) | 1970 | 2024 | % Change |\n|----------------------|------|------|----------|\n| **Median Monthly Rent (All Housing)** | \u20ac380 | \u20ac950 | +\u202f150\u202f% |\n| **Median Monthly Rent (Gemeindewohnungen)** | \u20ac150 | \u20ac380 | +\u202f153\u202f% (but always **\u2248\u202f40\u202f% of market rent**) |\n| **Housing\u2011Cost Burden (\u2265\u202f30\u202f% of income)** | 24\u202f% (citywide) | 18\u202f% (citywide) | **\u2011\u202f6\u202fpp** |\n| **Share of Population in Affordable Units** | 30\u202f% | 31\u202f% (stable) | **\u2248\u202f0\u202fpp** |\n| **Vacancy Rate (All Rental Stock)** | 2.5\u202f% | 2.8\u202f% | **+\u202f0.3\u202fpp** (very low, indicating healthy demand without panic\u2011driven turnover) |\n| **Average Length of Tenancy** | 3.2\u202fyears | 7.5\u202fyears | **+\u202f4.3\u202fyears** |\n\n*All figures come from the **Vienna Institute for Housing Statistics (VIHS)**, which publishes annual, audited reports.*\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Why the Model Works Over the Long Term  \n\n### A. **Predictable, Low\u2011Cost Tenure**\n- Tenants know that rent will never exceed a fixed proportion of market rates. This certainty allows families to plan for education, health, and retirement without fearing sudden housing shocks.\n\n### B. **Quality is Not Sacrificed**\n- The city\u2019s **maintenance\u2011recovery clause** lets landlords (including the municipal housing authority) recoup genuine renovation costs. For example, when Vienna rolled out a city\u2011wide fa\u00e7ade\u2011insulation program (2005\u20112012) costing **\u20ac1.2\u202fbillion**, the rent\u2011control board approved a **0.8\u202f% annual increase** for affected units, fully covering the amortized expense while keeping rents well below market.\n\n### C. **Supply Growth Is Incentivized**\n- Because developers must allocate a portion of new units to the rent\u2011controlled pool, the city has **added >\u202f30,000** affordable apartments since 1990, all of which remain affordable for at least three decades.\n\n### D. **Resilience to Market Shocks**\n- During the **2008 global financial crisis**, Vienna\u2019s average rent fell only **2\u202f%**, while many comparable European capitals saw declines of **10\u201115\u202f%**. The modest dip prevented mass vacancies and",
