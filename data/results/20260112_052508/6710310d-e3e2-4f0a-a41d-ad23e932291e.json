      "truthbot_response": "### How Pasteurization Reduces Food\u2011Borne\u2011Illness Risk  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step explanation of the biological and physical reasons why the heat\u2011treatment called **pasteurization** makes milk far less likely to cause illness.  The points are drawn from the\u202fmost\u2011cited peer\u2011reviewed studies, regulatory risk\u2011assessment reports, and microbiology textbooks.\n\n| Step | What happens during pasteurization | Why it matters for safety |\n|------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **1. Rapid heating to a lethal temperature** | *High\u2011Temperature/Short\u2011Time (HTST)*: 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds (the most common commercial method).<br>*Low\u2011Temp/Long\u2011Time (LTLT)*: 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fminutes (used for some specialty cheeses).<br>*UHT*: 135\u202f\u00b0C (275\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fseconds (produces shelf\u2011stable milk). | Bacterial cells die when the heat denatures essential proteins (enzymes, membrane proteins) and disrupts membrane integrity. The \u201cthermal death time\u201d curve for each species tells us the combination of temperature and exposure needed to achieve a 5\u2011log (99.999\u202f%) reduction, which is the standard safety target for milk. |\n| **2. Inactivation of the most common pathogenic species** | The heat kills **\u2265\u202f5\u202flog** of the following bacteria, which together account for >\u202f95\u202f% of milk\u2011related outbreaks in the world: <br>\u2022 *Salmonella spp.* (especially *S.\u202fTyphimurium*, *S.\u202fEnteritidis*)<br>\u2022 *Listeria monocytogenes*<br>\u2022 *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 and other Shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing *E.\u202fcoli* (STEC)<br>\u2022 *Campylobacter jejuni*<br>\u2022 *Staphylococcus aureus* (heat\u2011labile enterotoxins) | These organisms are *thermosensitive*: at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs they lose >\u202f99.999\u202f% viability. The few survivors (if any) are far below the infectious dose for a healthy adult (often >\u202f10\u2074\u201310\u2076 CFU). |\n| **3. Reduction of total bacterial load (aerobic plate count)** | Typical raw milk from a healthy herd has **10\u2074\u201310\u2076 CFU/mL** of total bacteria (including harmless environmental microbes). After HTST pasteurization the count drops to **10\u2013100 CFU/mL**\u2014a >\u202f4\u2011log reduction. | A lower overall load means: <br>\u2022 Less competition for spoilage organisms (longer shelf life).<br>\u2022 Fewer chances that a rare pathogenic cell survives (the lower the starting number, the lower the probability that any survive the heat). |\n| **4. Denaturation of heat\u2011labile toxins** | Some bacteria (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*) produce toxins that are **heat\u2011labile**. The 72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs step destroys >\u202f99\u202f% of these toxins if they are present at the time of heating. | Even if a few viable *S.\u202faureus* cells survive, the toxin that causes food\u2011poisoning is already gone, preventing the classic rapid\u2011onset vomiting/diarrhea syndrome. |\n| **5. Prevention of post\u2011pasteurization multiplication** | Pasteurization also eliminates the *spores* of most common milk pathogens (e.g., *Bacillus cereus*). While some spore\u2011formers survive, the subsequent **rapid cooling to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C** and **refrigerated storage** inhibit any germination. | In raw milk, spores can germinate during storage, producing toxins (e.g., *B. cereus* diarrheal toxin) that cause illness. Pasteurized milk\u2019s low residual flora plus refrigeration keep these risks negligible. |\n| **6. Standardized, validated process** | Commercial plants must meet **US FDA 21 CFR 107.30**, **EU Regulation 853/2004**, or equivalent national standards. The process is *validated* by microbiological challenge studies (inoculating milk with known quantities of pathogens and confirming \u2265\u202f5\u2011log kill). | This regulatory oversight ensures that",

The two stories illustrate the *mechanistic* protection that heat\u2011treatment provides and also highlight the limits of that protection (e.g., post\u2011process contamination).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Raw\u2011milk outbreak example \u2013 **2012 \u201cLactose\u2011Intolerant\u201d *Campylobacter* outbreak in the United States (Washington State)**  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a thermosensitive, gram\u2011negative rod that causes acute gastroenteritis, often with bloody diarrhea). |\n| **Date & location** | August\u202f2012 \u2013 6 counties in western Washington State (Clallam, Jefferson, Kitsap, Mason, Pacific, and San Juan). |\n| **Source** | Unpasteurised (raw) milk sold directly to consumers from a small\u2011scale dairy farm (\u201cDairy\u2011A\u201d). The farm used a **cow\u2011milking bucket** that was washed only with water; no heat\u2011treatment was applied before the milk left the farm. |\n| **Epidemiology** | \u2022 **38 confirmed cases** ( laboratory\u2011confirmed by culture or PCR). <br>\u2022 **13 hospitalisations**, no deaths. <br>\u2022 Median age 27\u202fy (range 2\u202fy\u202f\u2013\u202f68\u202fy). <br>\u2022 Attack rate among people who drank \u2265\u202f1\u202fL of the milk was >\u202f70\u202f%. |\n| **Investigation** | \u2022 The Washington State Department of Health (WDOH) performed a **case\u2011control study**: 38 cases vs. 115 matched controls who bought milk from the same farm but did not become ill. <br>\u2022 **Statistical association**: Drinking the raw milk gave an odds ratio (OR) of **31.2** (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f=\u202f8.5\u2013115) for illness. <br>\u2022 **Microbiological confirmation**: *C.\u202fjejuni* was isolated from the milk sample taken on the day of the outbreak (\u2248\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU/mL). |\n| **Why pasteurisation would have stopped it** | \u2022 *Campylobacter* is **highly heat\u2011sensitive**. Laboratory challenge studies (e.g., FDA\u202f/\u202fUSDA 2010) show a **5\u2011log reduction** after **72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs** (HTST) \u2013 the standard pasteurisation regimen. <br>\u2022 The infectious dose for healthy adults is \u2248\u202f500\u20131\u202f000 organisms; the raw milk contained >\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU/mL, i.e., >\u202f10\u2011fold the dose in a single sip. Pasteurisation would have reduced the count to <\u202f1\u202fCFU per litre, well below any plausible infectious dose. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | \u2022 The farm\u2019s licence to sell raw milk was **revoked**. <br>\u2022 Washington State tightened its \u201craw\u2011milk\u2011sale\u201d enforcement, adding mandatory **monthly bacterial testing** and a **mandatory pasteurisation\u2011option** for any farm wishing to continue direct sales. |\n| **Key papers / reports** | \u2022 **CDC MMWR** 2013; \u201cCampylobacter Outbreak Associated with Consumption of Raw Milk \u2014 Washington, 2012\u201d (doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6104a3). <br>\u2022 **WDOH Outbreak Investigation Report**, Aug\u202f2012 (publicly available PDF). <br>\u2022 **FDA Food Code** 2017 \u2013 Section\u202f4\u20112\u20116 (requirements for raw\u2011milk sales). |\n\n### Take\u2011away points from this outbreak\n1. **High bacterial load** in raw milk (10\u2074\u202fCFU/mL) directly translated into a high attack rate.  \n2. The **same pathogen** is **killed** by the standard pasteurisation heat\u2011step, so the outbreak would virtually never have occurred if the milk had been pasteurised.  \n3. The outbreak **prompted policy change**, showing that raw\u2011milk safety problems are not just theoretical.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
