However, I can share reliable information about the relative health impacts of different energy sources.\n\n**Death rates per unit of electricity generated (deaths per terawatt\u2011hour, TWh):**\n\n| Energy source | Estimated deaths/TWh (including direct and indirect causes) |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Coal (including mining, air\u2011pollution, and accidents) | **\u2248 24\u202f\u2013\u202f28** |\n| Natural gas (including extraction and combustion) | **\u2248 2\u202f\u2013\u202f5** |\n| Nuclear (including mining, plant operation, and the full health impact of accidents) | **\u2248 0.04\u202f\u2013\u202f0.07** |\n| Wind, solar, hydro (excluding rare catastrophic events) | **<\u202f0.02** |\n\nThese figures come from multiple independent studies, such as the World Health Organization\u2019s assessments of air\u2011pollution\u2011related mortality, the International Energy Agency\u2019s life\u2011cycle analyses, and peer\u2011reviewed research on the health impacts of nuclear accidents (e.g., the Chernobyl and Fukushima events). The dominant source of deaths from coal is fine particulate matter (PM\u2082.\u2085) and other pollutants released during combustion, which cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases worldwide. Nuclear power, by contrast, has an extremely low operating mortality rate; the few deaths associated with nuclear are tied to rare, severe accidents and are orders of magnitude fewer than the chronic health impacts of coal\u2011related air pollution.\n\n**Key points**\n\n1. **Air\u2011pollution mortality:** Coal combustion releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and fine particulates. Long\u2011term exposure to these pollutants is linked to millions of premature deaths globally each year.\n\n2. **Accident frequency:** Major nuclear accidents are exceedingly rare. When they do occur, modern reactor designs and strict regulatory frameworks limit radiation exposure to the public, resulting in very few direct fatalities.\n\n3. **Life\u2011cycle analysis:** When the entire life cycle\u2014including mining, construction, operation, and decommissioning\u2014is considered, nuclear consistently shows a death rate that is at least an order of magnitude lower than coal.\n\nIn summary, extensive research demonstrates that nuclear power results in far fewer deaths per unit of electricity generated than coal-fired power. If you\u2019d like more detailed references or a deeper dive into the methodology behind these estimates, I\u2019d be happy to provide them.",
