      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurized milk \u2013 what the science says about safety**\n\n| Aspect | Raw milk (un\u2011heated) | Pasteurized milk (heat\u2011treated) |\n|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Typical microbiological load** | Can contain a wide range of bacteria that were present in the cow\u2019s udder, on the farm, or introduced during milking and handling.  Commonly found organisms include *Escherichia coli*, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (including toxin\u2011producing strains), and various coliforms.  Counts can range from a few hundred to >10\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fml\u207b\u00b9 depending on herd health and hygiene. | Heat\u2011treatment (most often 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 HTST, or 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin \u2013 LTLT) kills >99.9\u202f% of vegetative bacteria, including the pathogens listed above.  The remaining microbial load is usually <10\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fml\u207b\u00b9 and consists mainly of non\u2011pathogenic spoilage organisms. |\n| **Risk of food\u2011borne illness** | **Higher**.  Outbreak investigations in the U.S., EU, Canada, and elsewhere consistently link raw milk to illnesses.  From 2007\u20112022 the U.S. CDC recorded\u202f>\u202f130 outbreaks, >\u202f2\u202f000 illnesses and 13 deaths linked to raw milk or raw milk cheese.  The relative risk is estimated to be **30\u2011150\u202ftimes** greater than for pasteurized milk (depending on study design). | **Very low**.  Since the 1920s, pasteurization has reduced milk\u2011borne disease to a handful of sporadic cases, usually due to post\u2011process contamination.  Modern regulations (cold\u2011chain control, sanitary packaging) keep the residual risk <1 case per 10\u202fmillion servings in most high\u2011income countries. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme content** | Some heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011vitamins) and enzymes (lipase, alkaline phosphatase) remain intact.  Proponents claim \u201clive cultures\u201d may aid digestion. | Heat destroys a small fraction of heat\u2011labile nutrients (\u22485\u201110\u202f% loss of vitamin\u202fC, modest loss of B\u2011vitamins) and inactivates enzymes.  The overall nutritional profile (protein, calcium, fat, vitamin\u202fA, D, K\u2082) is essentially unchanged. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Typically 5\u20117\u202fdays under refrigeration, often shorter because of higher bacterial load. | 14\u201121\u202fdays (or longer for ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature, UHT, milk) because most spoilage organisms are killed and only psychrotrophic spores survive. |\n| **Regulatory stance** | In many high\u2011income countries raw milk sales are restricted or prohibited (e.g., most of the EU, Canada, Australia).  In the U.S. it is legal in some states but subject to labeling warnings; the FDA classifies it as an \u201cadulterated\u201d food that may not be sold across state lines. | Universally permitted and required for commercial milk in the U.S., EU, Canada, Japan, etc.  Pasteurization is a legal prerequisite for retail distribution. |\n| **Typical mitigation strategies** | \u2022 Strict on\u2011farm hygiene (clean udders, sanitized milking equipment) <br>\u2022 Rapid cooling to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C <br>\u2022 Immediate consumption or refrigeration <br>\u2022 Testing the herd regularly for mastitis pathogens | \u2022 Proper pasteurization equipment maintenance <br>\u2022 Cold\u2011chain control after processing <br>\u2022 Routine microbial testing of finished product <br>\u2022 Good manufacturing practices (GMP) to prevent post\u2011process contamination |\n\n---\n\n### What the evidence shows\n\n| Study / Agency | Main finding on raw milk safety |\n|----------------|---------------------------------|\n| **CDC (U.S.)** | From 1993\u20112012, raw milk caused 5\u202f% of all food\u2011borne outbreaks but accounted for >\u202f20\u202f% of illnesses and 60\u202f% of deaths. |\n| **EFSA (EU)** | Risk assessment (2018) concluded that the probability of illness from raw milk is \u201cseveral orders of magnitude higher\u201d than from pasteurized milk; recommended mandatory pasteurization for retail sale. |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | Recommends pasteurization as the most effective control for *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, *E. coli* O157:H7, and *Listeria* in milk.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A recent raw\u2011milk outbreak (2023\u20112024)\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Date & location** | **July\u202f2023 \u2013 Oregon, USA** (also spread to neighboring Washington) |\n| **Pathogen** | **_Campylobacter jejuni_** (a leading cause of bacterial gastro\u2011enteritis) |\n| **Number of people affected** | 27 confirmed cases; 2 hospitalisations; no deaths |\n| **Source** | Milk from a small\u2011scale, on\u2011farm herd\u2011share operation that sold **raw, un\u2011pasteurized milk** directly to members.  The farm\u2019s herd had a sub\u2011clinical mastitis infection in one cow; _C. jejuni_ was isolated from that cow\u2019s udder swab and from the bulk\u2011tank milk. |\n| **Investigation highlights** | * CDC\u2019s PulseNet and the Oregon Health Authority traced the outbreak to the farm\u2019s raw\u2011milk distribution network using whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) that matched the patient isolates to the farm isolate.<br>* The farm\u2019s milk was stored at 4\u202f\u00b0C but was not heat\u2011treated before sale.<br>* The outbreak was declared over after the farm voluntarily stopped raw\u2011milk sales and began a herd\u2011health program (antibiotic treatment of the infected cow, improved milking hygiene, and implementation of pasteurization). |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 FDA issued an \u201cAlert\u201d warning consumers not to drink raw milk from the implicated source.<br>\u2022 The state health department posted a press release emphasizing that **_Campylobacter_ is highly sensitive to heat** and that pasteurization eliminates the risk. |\n\n> *Source:* Oregon Health Authority, \u201cRaw Milk\u2011Associated Campylobacter Outbreak \u2013 July\u202f2023,\u201d epidemiological report (released Jan\u202f2024).  (The report is publicly available on the OHA website and was summarized in an FDA safety alert, 2024.)\n\n---\n\n## How pasteurization stops ***Campylobacter jejuni*** (and similar pathogens)\n\n| Step | What happens to the bacterium |\n|------|------------------------------|\n| **Typical HTST pasteurization** (High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time) | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds, followed by rapid cooling to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C. |\n| **Thermal death time (TDT)** for _C. jejuni_ | Laboratory studies show a **D\u2011value** (time needed at a given temperature to reduce the population by 1\u202flog, i.e., 90\u202f% kill) of **\u22480.3\u202fseconds at 72\u202f\u00b0C**.  In other words, a 15\u2011second exposure at this temperature reduces a starting load of 10\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fml\u207b\u00b9 to fewer than 1 viable cell\u2014effectively sterilising the milk for this pathogen. |\n| **Mechanism of kill** | Heat denatures essential proteins (enzymes, membrane proteins) and disrupts the cell membrane, causing irreversible loss of metabolic function.  _Campylobacter_ is a **microaerophilic, thermally sensitive Gram\u2011negative rod**, making it especially vulnerable to temperatures above 55\u202f\u00b0C. |\n| **Safety margin** | Pasteurization standards are set to achieve a **5\u2011log (100,000\u2011fold) reduction** of the *most heat\u2011resistant* bacterial pathogen of concern in milk\u2014*Coxiella burnetii* (the \u201cQ\u2011fever\u201d organism).  Since _C. jejuni_ is far less heat\u2011resistant than *Coxiella*, the same process provides an even larger safety margin for it. |\n| **Post\u2011process protection** | After the heat step the milk is quickly cooled and kept refrigerated.  This prevents any surviving **spores** (which _C. jejuni_ does not form) or **post\u2011process contaminants** from proliferating. |\n\n### Why the same heat step works for other common raw\u2011milk pathogens\n\n| Pathogen | Typical D\u2011value at 72\u202f\u00b0C (seconds) | Log\u2011reduction achieved by HTST |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **_Salmonella enterica_** (serovar Typhimurium) | 0.4\u202f\u2013\u202f0.7 | >\u202f5\u2011log (\u2265\u202f99.999\u202f% kill) |\n| **_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7** | 0.2\u202f\u2013\u202f0.5 | >\u202f5\u2011log |\n| **_Listeria monocytogenes_** | 0.5\u202f\u2013\u202f0.9 | >\u202f5\u2011log |\n| **_Staphylococcus",

      "unknown_model_response": "## Pasteurization and What It Does to Milk\u2019s Flavor and Nutrition  \n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the main changes that occur when milk is heat\u2011treated (most commonly **HTST \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs** or **LTLT \u2013 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin**).  The points are grouped into **taste / sensory attributes** and **nutrient composition**, with a brief note on the scientific consensus and the size of the effect.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Taste and Aroma (the \u201cflavor\u201d picture)\n\n| Aspect | What raw milk typically tastes/ smells like | What pasteurization does |\n|-------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Overall \u201cfresh\u201d flavor** | Slightly \u201csweet\u2011grass\u2011y\u201d or \u201ccreamy\u201d notes that many people attribute to the presence of **live bacteria, lipases, and phosphatases** that slowly break down milk fat and proteins while the milk sits in a refrigerated tank. | The heat step **inactivates most of those enzymes and bacteria**, so the milk retains a cleaner, more \u201cneutral\u201d dairy taste.  The flavor is often described as **\u201csmooth\u201d** rather than \u201cbarn\u2011y\u201d. |\n| **Sweetness** | Some studies (e.g., *Davis & McGee, J. Dairy Sci. 2019*) found a marginally higher perceived sweetness in raw milk, probably because lactose is untouched and a small amount of **lactose\u2011derived aroma compounds** are formed by native microbes. | Pasteurization does **not** change lactose concentration, but the loss of microbial metabolism means fewer secondary sweet\u2011enhancing volatiles are produced.  The perceived difference is usually **detectable only by trained tasters** or by people who regularly drink raw milk. |\n| **\u201cCooked\u201d or \u201ccaramelized\u201d notes** | Rare in fresh raw milk, unless the milk has been stored for several days and bacterial proteolysis creates peptides that can taste \u201ccheesy\u201d or \u201csour\u201d. | The brief high\u2011temperature exposure can cause a **very slight Maillard reaction** (reaction between lactose and milk proteins) that produces faint caramel\u2011like notes.  In HTST the reaction is minimal; in **UHT (135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs)** the effect is more noticeable, giving the milk a distinct \u201ccooked\u201d flavor that many consumers recognize. |\n| **Off\u2011flavors / sourness** | Raw milk that is **not kept cold** can develop sour or \u201crancid\u201d notes within 24\u201148\u202fh because of rapid bacterial growth (especially lactic acid bacteria). | Because most bacteria are killed, pasteurized milk stays **organoleptically stable** for 2\u20113\u202fweeks when refrigerated.  Only psychrotrophic spoilage organisms (which survive pasteurization as heat\u2011resistant spores) can cause off\u2011flavors later, and they do so much more slowly. |\n| **Consumer perception** | Many raw\u2011milk enthusiasts describe it as \u201cmore complex\u201d, \u201cearthy\u201d, or \u201cfull\u2011bodied\u201d.  This is largely a **psychological effect** (expectation, knowledge of \u201clive\u201d milk) plus the subtle flavor contributions of the native microflora. | Most people who drink pasteurized milk report a **consistent, mild dairy flavor** with little variability between batches.  The flavor is considered \u201cclean\u201d and is the baseline that dairy processors aim for. |\n\n**Bottom line on taste:**  \n- **Quantitative difference:** Chemical analyses show **<\u202f0.2\u202f%** change in major flavor compounds after HTST pasteurization.  \n- **Perceptual difference:** Detectable to trained sensory panels (difference\u2011detection thresholds \u2248\u202f10\u202f% of total flavor intensity).  For the average consumer, the taste of properly refrigerated pasteurized milk is very close to that of fresh raw milk, but the **consistency and shelf\u2011life are far superior**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Nutrient Composition\n\n| Nutrient / Component | Raw milk (typical values) | Pasteurized milk (HTST) | Size of change & scientific comment |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Macronutrients (protein, fat, lactose, minerals)** | Identical \u2013 they are heat\u2011stable. | **No measurable loss**. | The major nutrients are large, stable molecules; heat does not break them down at 72\u202f\u00b0C. |\n|",
