Theoretical foundations\n\n### 1.1. Market\u2011clearing vs. price\u2011control theory\n* In a competitive rental market, price = marginal cost of supplying a unit (land, construction, financing, maintenance).  \n* A **rent ceiling** set **below** the market\u2011clearing rent creates a *binding* price control.  The quantity demanded rises, the quantity supplied falls, producing a *shortage* (the classic textbook diagram).  \n\n### 1",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn the economic literature the *over\u2011whelming* consensus is that **rent\u2011control (RC) policies tend to lower the affordability of housing for the broad market in the long run** because they depress the incentive to build, maintain, and appropriately allocate rental units.  The *only* robust, long\u2011run benefit that most studies agree on is that **tenants who are already living in a controlled unit enjoy a lower rent for as long as they stay there**.  All other effects\u2014on overall rent levels, on the quantity and quality of housing, on who benefits, and on spill\u2011over markets\u2014are highly contingent on the exact design of the policy and on local market conditions, and the evidence is mixed for many of these channels.\n\nBelow is a *systematic* synthesis of the strongest evidence from every major perspective, with clear markers of what is well\u2011established, what remains debated, and where important data are still missing.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
