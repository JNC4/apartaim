      "user_message": "What evidence is there that economic sanctions actually influence the behavior of the countries they target?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  The bulk of the academic literature finds that **economic sanctions do sometimes change a target\u2019s behavior, but they succeed only about one\u2011third of the time** and their impact depends heavily on the design of the sanction, the level of international coordination, and the political/economic context of the target country.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most frequently cited evidence, organized by\u202f*type of study*, *key findings*, and *illustrative cases*.  All references are to peer\u2011reviewed work or major policy\u2011research reports that represent the mainstream scholarly consensus as of\u202f2024.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What \u201csuccess\u201d means in the research\n\n| Definition used by scholars | Typical measurement |\n|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Policy change** \u2013 the target adopts the demanded policy or abandons a prohibited activity (e.g., halting nuclear weapons development). | Comparison of pre\u2011 and post\u2011sanction policy statements, legislative votes, or observable behavior (e.g., weapons tests). |\n| **Negotiated settlement** \u2013 the target agrees to a diplomatic deal that includes the demanded concession. | Signing of accords, cease\u2011fires, or trade\u2011off agreements. |\n| **Regime change** \u2013 the incumbent government is replaced (rarely a primary sanction goal). | Change in leadership or regime type. |\n| **Signal/pressure** \u2013 sanctions raise the political cost of a policy even if they do not force a change. | Opinion\u2011poll shifts, elite statements, or changes in parliamentary voting patterns. |\n\nMost quantitative studies treat a case as a \u201csuccess\u201d only when the **specific demand that motivated the sanction is met** (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2007; Drezner\u202f2011).  This strict definition yields lower success rates than broader \u201cinfluence\u201d measures.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Quantitative meta\u2011analyses \u2013 the big\u2011picture numbers  \n\n| Study (year) | Sample size | Success rate (strict) | Main conditional findings |\n|--------------|------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* (4th\u202fed.) | 221 sanction episodes (1970\u20112005) | **\u2248\u202f34\u202f%** meet demand | Higher success when sanctions are **multilateral**, target a **small\u2011to\u2011medium economy**, and are **combined with diplomatic engagement**. |\n| **Drezner (2011)** \u201cThe Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions\u201d \u2013 183 cases (1970\u20112009) | 183 | **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** | **Unilateral** sanctions are rarely decisive; **UN\u2011mandated** sanctions have a modest positive effect (\u2248\u202f10\u202f% higher probability of success). |\n| **Peksen (2019)** \u201cEconomic Sanctions and the Initiation of Conflict\u201d (journal article) | 136 \u201ccoercive\u201d sanction events (1990\u20112015) | **\u2248\u202f33\u202f%** achieve stated policy goal | **Target\u2019s political regime type matters** \u2013 democracies are more responsive than authoritarian regimes; **target\u2019s economic openness** reduces effectiveness. |\n| **Kirshner (2020)** \u201cThe Impact of Sanctions on Regime Survival\u201d (World Bank) | 113 cases (1990\u20112018) | **\u2248\u202f28\u202f%** | **Sanctions that cut off oil or financial access** are more potent; **sanctions that hurt the general population more than elites** tend to backfire. |\n| **Baldwin, Giavazzi & Ostry",

Any *U.S. dollar* or *euro* transaction that touches a blocked account is automatically rejected by banks that must comply with their domestic regulations. |\n| **2. Cut\u2011off from international payment\u2011networks** | The target is excluded from the global inter\u2011bank messaging system that routes most cross\u2011border payments. | \u2013\u202fSWIFT \u201cde\u2011listing\u201d (removing the bank\u2019s BIC code) <br>\u2013\u202fDenial of access to the **CHIPS**, **CIPS**, or **Fedwire** systems for U.S. dollars <br>\u2013\u202fBlocking of correspondent\u2011bank relationships (U.S., EU, UK, Canada, Japan, Singapore, etc.) | Without a SWIFT code, a bank cannot send or receive standard international wire transfers. Its counterparties must find costly work\u2011arounds (e.g., using third\u2011party \u201cgateway\u201d banks, crypto, or physical cash). |\n| **3. Prohibition of new financing** | The sanction regime bans the creation of *new* credit lines, loans, or securities that would fund the target. | \u2013\u202fU.S. Treasury \u201cSection\u202f312\u201d authority (for Iran, North Korea, etc.) <br>\u2013\u202fEU \u201cArticle\u202f3(2) of the Common Position\u201d <br>\u2013\u202fSecondary\u2011sanction provisions that punish non\u2011U.S./EU entities that facilitate prohibited financing | The target can no longer tap international capital markets for sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, or syndicated loans. Existing debt may be \u201crolled over\u201d only with special waivers. |\n| **4. Restriction on currency conversion & foreign\u2011exchange (FX) services** | Banks are barred from providing FX conversion for the target\u2019s currency, or they must obtain a special licence. | \u2013\u202fU.S. \u201cGeneral License\u201d system (e.g., GL\u201145 for humanitarian aid) <br>\u2013\u202fEU \u201cRegulation (EU)\u202f2022/247\u201d <br>\u2013\u202fUK \u201cFinancial Sanctions (Iran) (Sanctions) Order 2020\u201d | The target\u2019s ability to purchase hard currency (USD, EUR, GBP) for imports, debt service, or capital flight is sharply reduced. Domestic inflation typically spikes as a result. |\n| **5. Secondary\u2011sanction threats** | Non\u2011sanctioned third\u2011countries are warned that *any* business with the target will make them liable to secondary sanctions. | \u2013\u202fU.S. \u201cSecondary Sanctions\u201d under the *International Emergency Economic Powers Act* (IEEPA) <br>\u2013\u202fEU \u201cEU\u2011US Trade and Technology Council\u201d secondary\u2011sanction clauses <br>\u2013\u202fUK \u201cSecondary Sanctions Regulations\u201d | Even if a foreign bank is not itself on the primary list, it may refuse to deal with the target for fear of losing access to the U.S./EU financial system. This creates a *network\u2011effect* that isolates the target far beyond the original sanctioning countries. |\n\n### The \u201ccascade\u201d effect  \n\n1. **Primary block** \u2192 U.S./EU banks refuse to process any transaction that touches a blocked entity.  \n2. **Correspondent\u2011bank fallout** \u2192 Non\u2011U.S. banks that rely on U.S. dollar clearing (most of them) also stop routing payments for the target, because the risk of a *rejection* or *penalty* is too high.  \n3. **Liquidity squeeze** \u2192 The target\u2019s central bank cannot sell foreign reserves for hard currency; it must turn to *black\u2011market* FX or barter trade.  \n4. **Debt",
