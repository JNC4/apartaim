      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect the jobs and wages of workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) usually raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the benefits are not spread evenly across all workers.  Empirical work finds the following broad patterns:\n\n| Dimension | Typical direction of the effect | What the evidence says | Main caveats |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|\n| **Employment (total jobs)** | Small net gain (or no change) in the aggregate employment rate; large **sector\u2011specific shifts** | Most studies find that trade\u2011induced job creation in export\u2011oriented and import\u2011substituting industries is roughly offset by job losses in import\u2011competing sectors (e.g., Autor, Dorn & Hanson\u202f2013; OECD\u202f2020). | The net effect depends on the size of the country, the openness of its labor market, and the presence of complementary policies (e.g., active labour\u2011market programmes). |\n| **Wages (average)** | Slight rise in **average real wages** in the long run, but **large heterogeneity** | In high\u2011income countries, low\u2011skill wages tend to fall or stagnate while high\u2011skill wages rise (e.g., Autor et\u202fal.\u202f2013; IMF\u202f2022). In many middle\u2011income countries, average wages rise because trade expands the manufacturing sector and raises productivity (World Bank\u202f2019). | The magnitude varies with labor\u2011market institutions, the skill composition of the workforce, and the degree of \u201cskill\u2011biased\u201d technological change that accompanies trade. |\n| **Wage inequality** | \u2191 in most advanced economies; mixed in developing economies | The \u201cskill\u2011bias\u201d channel\u2014imports of low\u2011skill\u2011intensive goods and exports of high\u2011skill\u2011intensive goods\u2014has widened the wage gap in the United States, the EU, and Japan (Baldwin\u202f2016). In some fast\u2011growing Asian economies, the gap has narrowed because trade created many new low\u2011skill manufacturing jobs (e.g., Vietnam, Bangladesh). | Inequality is also shaped by education, minimum\u2011wage laws, union coverage, and tax/transfer systems. |\n| **Job quality (hours, benefits, security)** | Often **worsens** for workers who move into low\u2011skill, export\u2011oriented factories; **improves** for high\u2011skill, service\u2011sector jobs | Case studies of NAFTA\u2011related maquiladoras show longer hours and weaker contracts for low\u2011skill workers (Klein & Rojas\u202f2021). In contrast, high\u2011skill service jobs created by FTA\u2011driven outsourcing often come with better benefits (e.g., IT services in India). | \u201cJob quality\u201d is hard to measure uniformly; outcomes depend on domestic labour\u2011law enforcement. |\n| **Adjustment costs (short\u2011run unemployment, geographic mobility)** | **Negative** in the first 2\u20135\u202fyears for regions heavily exposed to import competition | Studies using \u201cexposure\u201d measures (e.g., US counties most exposed to Chinese imports) find spikes in unemployment and out\u2011migration (Autor, Dorn & Hanson\u202f2016). Similar patterns appear in Mexican states after NAFTA (Moran\u202f2019). | The depth of the dip is reduced when governments provide retraining, unemployment insurance, or relocation subsidies. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based discussion of **why** these patterns appear, the **exceptions** that matter, and the **policy tools** that can shape the outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it predicts for jobs & wages | Empirical relevance |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Comparative advantage & factor\u2011price equalisation** (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin) | Countries export goods that use their abundant factor intens",

      "user_message": "That makes a lot of sense\u2014thanks for breaking it down! Could you give a concrete example of how a specific free\u2011trade agreement, like NAFTA, affected workers in a particular industry or region?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **case\u2011study style** look at one of the most\u2011cited examples of NAFTA\u2019s labor\u2011market impact: **the U.S. \u201cRust Belt\u201d manufacturing sector (especially the automobile industry) and the adjacent border\u2011region towns in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana**.  The same episode is often used as a benchmark for how a large, bilateral free\u2011trade agreement can reshape jobs and wages in a specific industry and region.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Background \u2013 What NAFTA did\n\n| Element | What the agreement changed (1994\u20112020) |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination** | U.S. duties on most Mexican\u2011made autos, parts, and steel were phased out (complete by\u202f1996).  Mexico eliminated tariffs on U.S. autos and parts at the same time. |\n| **Rules of origin** | To qualify for duty\u2011free treatment a vehicle had to have \u2265\u202f62\u202f% of its value (later 55\u202f%) produced in North America.  This encouraged \u201ccross\u2011border supply\u2011chain integration\u201d: many components were made in the U.S., shipped to Mexico for final assembly, then shipped back. |\n| **Investment\u2011protection chapters** | Made it easier for U.S. automakers to set up \u201cknock\u2011down\u201d plants (CKD) in Mexico and for Mexican firms to invest in the United States. |\n| **Labor\u2011mobility provisions** | NAFTA created a \u201ctemporary entry\u201d (TN) visa for certain professionals, but there was **no general provision for low\u2011skill workers** to move across borders. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What actually happened to the **U.S. auto\u2011manufacturing workforce** (1994\u20112020)\n\n| Metric | Pre\u2011NAFTA (1993) | 2020 (latest long\u2011run data) | Direction of change | Main source |\n|--------|------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| **Total auto\u2011assembly jobs** (including parts) | ~\u202f800\u202fk (U.S.) | ~\u202f660\u202fk (U.S.) | **\u201117\u202f%** | BLS *Manufacturing Employment* series; *U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) 2021* |\n| **Average hourly compensation (inflation\u2011adjusted, 2020 $)** | $27.4 | $28.2 (including benefits) | **\u2248\u202f+3\u202f%** | BLS *Compensation\u2011to\u2011Employment Ratio* |\n| **Share of \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d (\u2265\u202fcollege) workers** | 38\u202f% | 46\u202f% | **\u2191** | BLS *Occupational Employment Statistics* |\n| **Regional concentration of job loss** | \u2013 | Largest declines in **Michigan\u2019s \u201cMotor City\u201d counties (Wayne, Macomb, Oakland)** and **Ohio\u2019s Mahoning & Trumbull** counties; modest gains in **border counties** (e.g., Indiana\u2019s Lake County, Michigan\u2019s Monroe) where plants moved *into* the U.S. to meet \u201cNorth\u2011America\u2011content\u201d rules. | \u2013 | *Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013*; *Klein & Rojas 2021* |\n\n### How the numbers are interpreted\n\n| Mechanism | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Off\u2011shoring of low\u2011skill assembly** | Plant\u2011level data show that many \u201cCKD\u201d operations that previously existed in the Midwest were relocated to Mexican states (e.g., GM\u2019s plant in *San Luis Potos\u00ed* opened 1995; Ford\u2019s *Cuautitl\u00e1n* plant 1999).  The U.S. plants that survived tended to shift toward **engine, transmission, and high\u2011tech component production**, which require more skilled labor. |\n| **Supply\u2011chain integration** | The \u201crule of origin\u201d forced automakers to source a larger share of parts from North America.  This created **new \u201ctier\u20111\u201d and \u201ctier\u20112\u201d supplier clusters** in the Upper Midwest (e.g., Michigan\u2019s \u201cauto\u2011parts corridor\u201d along I\u201194).  Those jobs are higher\u2011skill and higher\u2011pay than the assembly line jobs that left. |\n| **Wage polarization** | Workers who stayed in the sector saw wages rise modestly (\u2248\u202f+3\u202f% real) because their jobs became more skill\u2011intensive.  Workers who were displaced often moved to lower\u2011pay service jobs or",
