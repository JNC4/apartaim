(The same agreement also had measurable effects on low\u2011skill workers in the United States, but the Mexican experience is the clearest illustration of the mechanisms that scholars repeatedly highlight.)\n\n---\n\n## 1. What NAFTA did, in a nutshell  \n\n| Element | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Countries** | United States, Canada, Mexico |\n| **Date of entry into force** | 1\u202fJanuary\u202f1994 |\n| **Main provisions relevant to labour** | Elimination of tariffs on most goods, rules of origin, a side\u2011agreement on \u201cLabour Cooperation\u201d (non\u2011binding, focused on information\u2011exchange and technical assistance). No enforceable \u201csocial\u2011labour clause\u201d that could penalise a country for low wages or weak workplace protections. |\n| **Trade\u2011intensity change for Mexico** | Imports from the U.S. grew **~120\u202f%** (1993\u20112003) and exports to the U.S. grew **~250\u202f%** (same period). Overall trade\u2011to\u2011GDP rose from **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** (1993) to **\u2248\u202f55\u202f%** (2003). |\n\n**Why low\u2011skill workers matter:** In Mexico, the majority of the labour force in the 1990s had **\u2264\u202fprimary education** (\u2248\u202f55\u202f%). The bulk of those workers were employed in **agriculture, low\u2011skill manufacturing (textiles, footwear, electronics assembly), and informal services**\u2014the sectors most directly exposed to U.S. competition or to the \u201cassembly\u2011plant\u201d (maquiladora) boom spurred by NAFTA.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The two main channels that hit low\u2011skill workers  \n\n| Channel | What happened under NAFTA | Expected impact on low\u2011skill workers |\n|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **1. Import competition (price pressure)** | U.S. agricultural subsidies and higher productivity made U.S. corn, wheat, beef, and pork cheaper in Mexico. | Farmers and seasonal agricultural workers in the **rural interior** lost market share; many farms could not survive the price shock, leading to **job loss or forced migration** to cities. |\n| **2. Export\u2011oriented \u201cmaquiladora\u201d expansion** | Tariff\u2011free access to the U.S. market encouraged U.S. firms to locate **low\u2011skill assembly plants** (electronics, auto parts, apparel) in Mexican border states. | Created **new low\u2011skill jobs** in factories, but these were **concentrated in a few regions** (Baja California, Chihuahua, Nuevo Le\u00f3n). The jobs often paid **just above the minimum wage** and offered limited benefits or job security. |\n\nThe net effect was **regional polarization**: **border states** saw a modest rise in manufacturing employment for low\u2011skill workers, while **interior states** experienced a **decline** in agricultural and low\u2011skill manufacturing jobs.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Empirical findings \u2013 what the numbers actually show  \n\n### 3.1 Employment trends (1993\u20112003)\n\n| Region | Change in low\u2011skill employment (1993\u20112003) |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Border states (e.g., Baja\u202fCalifornia, Chihuahua, Nuevo\u202fLe\u00f3n)** | **+12\u202f%** in manufacturing jobs for workers without secondary education (source: **Cort\u00e9s & Gonz\u00e1lez, *World Bank Policy Research Working Paper* 2010**). |\n| **Interior agricultural states (e.g., Veracruz, Oaxaca, Chiapas)** | **\u20119\u202f%** in agricultural jobs for the same skill group (same source). |\n| **National aggregate (all sectors)** | **\u2248\u202f0\u202f%** net change in total employment for low\u2011skill workers (the gains in the border offset the losses elsewhere). |\n\n### 3.2 Wage outcomes  \n\n| Group | Wage change (real, 1993\u20112003) | Interpretation |\n|-------|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| **Low",
