      "unknown_model_response": "**How sanctions are meant to work \u2013 the \u201cmechanisms\u201d that policymakers rely on**\n\nEconomic sanctions are a diplomatic tool, not a magic bullet.  In the academic literature and among practitioners they are usually described as trying to move a target state (or non\u2011state actor) along one or more of the following pathways:\n\n| Mechanism | What it tries to do | Typical instruments | How it is supposed to produce change |\n|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Economic coercion (cost\u2011imposition)** | Raise the tangible cost of the target\u2019s unwanted policy so that the cost outweighs the perceived benefits. | Trade bans, asset freezes, financial\u2011transaction restrictions, embargoes on oil, technology, or luxury goods. | By shrinking GDP, cutting export revenues, increasing inflation or reducing government\u2011budget capacity, the sanction\u2011imposer hopes the target will alter the policy to stop the losses. |\n| **Incentive\u2011based bargaining (carrot\u2011and\u2011stick)** | Offer a \u201creward\u201d (sanctions relief) if the target complies, while keeping the \u201cstick\u201d in place otherwise. | Conditional lifting of sanctions, \u201csanctions\u2011for\u2011reform\u201d packages, phased\u2011out restrictions. | The prospect of regaining access to markets, finance, or technology creates a positive incentive that can be more persuasive than pure punishment. |\n| **Elite or regime pressure (targeted/\u201csmart\u201d sanctions)** | Directly hurt the decision\u2011makers or their support base, making the policy change politically costly for them. | Asset freezes of officials, travel bans, bans on specific sectors (e.g., defense, energy), secondary sanctions on firms that do business with the elite. | By squeezing the personal wealth, international mobility, or business interests of the ruling clique, the sanctions aim to create internal dissent or a \u201cwin\u2011win\u201d calculus for those elites to push for policy change. |\n| **Signaling and normative isolation** | Broadcast disapproval, delegitimize the target\u2019s actions, and shape the international narrative. | Public naming\u2011and\u2011shaming, multilateral resolutions, coordinated bans, restrictions on participation in international bodies. | The diplomatic cost of being a pariah can affect a regime\u2019s domestic legitimacy and make it more eager to conform to accepted norms. |\n| **Deterrence of future behavior** | Make the cost of a particular action so high that other states (or the same state again) will think twice before repeating it. | Broad, pre\u2011emptive sanctions regimes (e.g., non\u2011proliferation sanctions), threat of secondary sanctions. | The threat of swift, severe economic penalties is intended to alter the calculus of potential violators before they act. |\n| **Containment/weakening of capability** | Reduce the target\u2019s ability to fund or execute the objectionable activity (e.g., weapons programs, terrorist financing). | Restrictions on dual\u2011use technology, caps on oil exports, bans on financing for specific projects. | By choking off inputs or revenues needed for the prohibited activity, the target may be forced to scale back or abandon it. |\n| **Domestic political signaling (to the sanction\u2011imposer\u2019s audience)** | Show the home electorate and allies that decisive action is being taken, even if the direct effect on the target is modest. | Highly visible sanctions, \u201cquick\u2011response\u201d measures. | This mechanism does not directly alter the target\u2019s behavior, but it sustains political support for the broader foreign\u2011policy agenda. |\n\n---\n\n### What the evidence says\n\n| Finding | Evidence base | Interpretation |\n|---------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Coercive sanctions can work when the target is economically vulnerable and the sanctioning coalition is united.** | Meta\u2011analyses of 150+ cases (e.g., Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott\u202f&\u202f",

Theoretical \u201cmechanisms\u201d \u2013 *how* sanctions are supposed to influence behavior  \n\nScholars have identified **four broad pathways** through which sanctions can affect a target.  The mechanisms often operate together, and their relative strength varies with sanction design, the target\u2019s political\u2011economic structure, and the international context.\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Key scholarly sources |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| **1. Economic coercion (direct cost\u2011imposition)** | Reduces national income, foreign\u2011exchange earnings, or access to critical inputs; raises inflation, unemployment, or fiscal deficits, making the status quo \u201cunbearable.\u201d | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f(2007, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*); Kaempfer & Lowenberg\u202f(1999). |\n| **2.

Most analysts (see Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal., *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*, 2007; Malone\u202fet\u202fal., *UN Sanctions and the Libyan Decision*, 2005) attribute the decision **largely** to the combination of: <br>1. **Economic pressure on oil revenue** (the \u201ccost\u2011imposition\u201d channel). <br>2. **Personal pressure on the Gaddafi family and senior officials** (the \u201celite pressure\u201d channel). <br>3. **Diplomatic signalling that a return to normal trade would be possible only after compliance** (the \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d channel). |\n\n### Why this case is often highlighted as a success\n\n| Aspect | What the literature notes |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Targeted nature** | The sanctions did **not** impose a blanket embargo on all Libyan trade; they left humanitarian goods and most non\u2011oil sectors untouched, which reduced humanitarian backlash and made the measures politically sustainable in the West. |\n| **Clear demand\u2011and\u2011reward structure** | UN resolutions explicitly linked **sanctions removal** to **verification of dismantlement**. When Libya complied, the sanctions were lifted, giving the regime a concrete incentive. |\n| **Multilateral enforcement** | Because the UN, EU, and US all applied the same restrictions, Libya could not simply reroute oil sales through a single non\u2011sanctioning partner. |\n| **Elite\u2011focus** | Travel bans and asset freezes hit the inner circle personally, creating internal debate within the regime about the cost of continuing the WMD programme. |\n| **Measurable outcome** | Within a few years the regime announced the **complete abandonment** of its nuclear, chemical and ballistic\u2011missile programmes, and the **sanctions were fully lifted** (UN Resolution\u202f1907, 2009). |\n\n### Caveats and scholarly debate\n\n| Point of contention | Evidence / Reasoning |\n|---------------------|----------------",
