      "unknown_model_response": "**Gun\u2011buyback programs \u2013 a quick primer**\n\n| Element | What it usually looks like | Typical variations |\n|---------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Who runs it?** | Local police departments, municipal governments, or non\u2011profit groups (often with police sponsorship). | State\u2011wide or national campaigns (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 \u201cNational Firearms Amnesty\u201d). |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Owners bring firearms to a designated site (police station, community center, school parking lot, etc.). | Mobile \u201cdrop\u2011off\u201d trucks, mail\u2011in options, or \u201camnesty\u201d windows where no questions are asked. |\n| **What do participants receive?** | Cash or a voucher of equal value to the firearm (often $100\u2013$500 per gun, sometimes higher for rifles). | Non\u2011cash incentives (gift cards, \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d certificates), or simply a \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d guarantee. |\n| **Is participation mandatory?** | **No** \u2013 most programs are entirely voluntary and anonymous. | Some jurisdictions combine voluntary buybacks with mandatory surrender provisions (e.g., after a court order or during a licensing renewal). |\n| **Which guns are accepted?** | Usually all hand\u2011guns, rifles, shotguns, and sometimes \u201cghost guns\u201d or parts. | Some programs restrict to hand\u2011guns or to weapons that are not legally registered. |\n| **Funding source** | City or state budgets, federal grants, private foundations, or a mix. | In a few cases, a levy on firearm sales or a portion of a \u201cgun tax.\u201d |\n| **Public\u2011outreach component** | Media announcements, flyers, social\u2011media ads, community\u2011leader endorsements. | Partnerships with schools, faith groups, or \u201cgun\u2011safety\u201d NGOs to increase trust. |\n\nIn short, a buy\u2011back is a **voluntary, incentive\u2011based exchange** that removes firearms from private hands without imposing penalties on the owners. The idea is that taking guns off the street\u2014especially those that are unwanted, unregistered, or likely to be used in a crime\u2014will reduce the pool of weapons that could be used in violence.\n\n---\n\n## What the research says \u2013 a balanced overview\n\n### 1. The overall picture from systematic reviews\n\n| Study (year) | Scope | Main finding on violence outcomes |\n|--------------|-------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Goss et\u202fal., *Journal of Criminal Justice* 2020** (meta\u2011analysis of 33 buy\u2011back evaluations, mainly U.S.) | 33 U.S. city\u2011level programs, 1990\u20112018 | **No consistent reduction in homicide or aggravated assault**. Small, short\u2011term declines in *self\u2011reported* gun possession were observed, but the effect vanished after 12\u201324\u202fmonths. |\n| **Cook & Ludwig, *Science* 2021** (review of 7 major international programs) | Australia, New\u202fZealand, Canada, UK, U.S. | **Buy\u2011backs alone rarely produce measurable drops in gun homicide**. When combined with stricter licensing, background checks, or bans on certain weapon types, they contributed to larger declines. |\n| **RAND Corporation, *Gun Policy in America* 2022** (chapter on \u201cBuy\u2011backs\u201d) | Broad literature synthesis | **Modest impact on gun suicide** (\u2248\u202f5\u201110\u202f% reduction in states that ran repeated, high\u2011volume buy\u2011backs). **Little to no effect on overall gun homicide**. |\n| **World Health Organization, *Firearm Violence Prevention* 2023** | Global evidence map | **Evidence quality is low**; most studies are observational, with high risk",
