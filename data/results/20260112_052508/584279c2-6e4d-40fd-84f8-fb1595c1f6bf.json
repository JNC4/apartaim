      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economy and the average real wage of the population, but they also shift jobs between sectors, regions, and skill groups. The net gain is usually modest, and the distribution of that gain can be uneven\u2014some workers see higher pay and more opportunities, while others face job loss, lower wages, or weaker bargaining power. How large these effects are depends on the structure of each country\u2019s economy, the design of the FTA, and the presence of complementary policies (e.g., active\u2011labour\u2011market programs, wage\u2011floor laws, trade adjustment assistance).\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the main channels through which FTAs affect workers, followed by a \u201cwhat the research says\u201d box, a few illustrative case studies, and pointers for policy\u2011makers and workers who want to mitigate the downsides.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main Economic Channels\n\n| Channel | What happens | Typical impact on workers |\n|---------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **Export expansion & lower consumer prices** | Removing tariffs lets firms sell more abroad and import cheaper inputs. | Higher demand for workers in export\u2011oriented sectors (often manufacturing, agriculture, services). Consumers enjoy lower prices, which raises real purchasing power even for those whose jobs are unchanged. |\n| **Import competition** | Domestic firms now face cheaper or higher\u2011quality foreign rivals. | Workers in industries that cannot compete may lose jobs or see wages fall. The effect is strongest in low\u2011skill, labor\u2011intensive sectors (e.g., textiles, apparel, certain assembly plants). |\n| **Reallocation of resources** | Capital and labour move toward sectors with comparative advantage (those that export well or use imported inputs efficiently). | **Winners:** workers with skills that match expanding sectors (often higher\u2011skill, more mobile). **Losers:** workers tied to declining sectors, especially if they have limited mobility or training. |\n| **Productivity spill\u2011overs** | Exposure to foreign competition can force firms to adopt better technology and management practices. | In the long run, workers in re\u2011skilled or upgraded firms may earn higher wages. Short\u2011run adjustment can be painful if firms downsize before gains materialize. |\n| **Changes in labor\u2011market institutions** | FTAs sometimes contain clauses on labor standards, right\u2011to\u2011organize, or dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms. | In theory, such clauses can protect workers; in practice, enforcement varies. In some cases, governments may weaken labor regulations to attract investment, which can depress wages and job security. |\n| **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** | Investors set up plants or services to take advantage of the trade regime. | New jobs are created, often in export\u2011oriented or service sectors. Quality of those jobs (wages, benefits, safety) depends on host\u2011country regulations and the type of investor. |\n| **Adjustment costs** | Workers who lose jobs must search for new employment, retrain, or relocate. | Short\u2011run unemployment, income loss, and possible long\u2011run skill mismatch. The magnitude of these costs is the main source of distributional controversy. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the research (mainstream academic and policy literature) finds\n\n| Finding | Typical magnitude | Sources / consensus |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Average real\u2011wage gain** | 0.5\u202f%\u20132\u202f% per year for the whole economy, after a few years of adjustment. | Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013); Felbermayr & Larch (2013); OECD (2021) \u201cTrade and Wages\u201d. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific job changes** | Export\u2011oriented sectors can grow by 5\u202f%\u201315\u202f% in employment; import\u2011competed sectors can lose a similar share. | Krugman (1995) \u201cTrade and Wages\u201d; World Bank (2020) \u201cTrade\u2011Related Adjustment\u201d. |\n| **Skill\u2011gradient** | High\u2011skill workers (+30\u202f%\u201370\u202f% wage growth) tend to benefit, low\u2011",

What the EU\u2011Poland deal changed for the Polish labour market  \n\n| Change | Economic mechanism | Immediate effect on workers |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination on imports and exports** | Polish firms could import EU\u2011made intermediate goods (machinery, chemicals, components) at near\u2011zero cost; Polish exporters gained duty\u2011free access to a market of 450\u202fmillion consumers. | **Export boom:** Manufacturing (automobiles, appliances, furniture, electronics) grew 8\u202f%\u201112\u202f% per year (2004\u20112012).  <br>**Import competition:** Low\u2011cost EU agricultural products (e.g., dairy, pork) and textiles entered the market, squeezing some domestic producers. |\n| **Regulatory alignment** (EU standards on product safety, labour, environment) | Firms had to upgrade processes to meet EU certification (CE marking, HACCP, ISO). | **Productivity gains** in firms that invested in new machines and quality\u2011control systems; workers in those firms saw higher hourly productivity and, on average, higher wages. |\n| **Increased foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI)** | EU investors (Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands) set up plants to serve the single market. | **Job creation**: +\u202f~\u202f450\u202f000 jobs in manufacturing between 2004\u20112014, many in higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay positions (automotive assembly, electronics, aircraft components). |\n| **Labour\u2011mobility** | Polish citizens could work in any EU country without a work permit. | **Out\u2011migration** of low\u2011skill workers to the UK, Germany, Ireland; remittances rose from US\u202f$2\u202fbn (2004) to >\u202fUS\u202f$9\u202fbn (2018).
