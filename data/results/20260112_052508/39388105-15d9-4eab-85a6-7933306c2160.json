Pre\u2011clinical (Laboratory & Animal) Studies** | \u2022 The vaccine candidate (often a weakened, killed, or sub\u2011unit form of the pathogen, or a piece of its genetic material) is produced in the lab. <br>\u2022 Researchers test it in cell cultures and then in at least two animal species (usually rodents and a larger animal such as a rabbit or non\u2011human primate). | \u2022 Look for **toxicology** (does it cause organ damage?), **local reactogenicity** (pain, swelling at the injection site), and **systemic reactogenicity** (fever, behavior changes). <br>\u2022 Determine the **dose range** that produces an immune response without harmful effects. | 1\u20133\u202fyears (often overlapping with early human work for urgent diseases). |\n| **2. Phase\u202fI Clinical Trials (First\u2011in\u2011Human)** | \u2022 20\u2011100 healthy adult volunteers receive a **very low dose** of the vaccine. <br>\u2022 Researchers monitor for immediate adverse events and collect blood to measure the immune response. | \u2022 **Safety\u2011primary endpoint**: any serious adverse event (SAE) within days\u2011weeks after vaccination. <br>\u2022 **Immunogenicity**: does the vaccine generate antibodies or T\u2011cell responses? | Several months. |\n| **3. Phase\u202fII Clinical Trials (Expanded Safety & Dosing)** | \u2022 100\u2011500 participants, often including the target age group (e.g., toddlers). <br>\u2022 Multiple dose levels and schedules are tested to find the **optimal balance** of immunity and tolerability. | \u2022 **Reactogenicity**: frequency and severity of fever, injection\u2011site pain, rash, etc. <br>\u2022 **Safety labs**: blood counts, liver/kidney panels to detect sub\u2011clinical effects. <br>\u2022 Continued immunogenicity assessment. | 6\u202fmonths\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202fyears. |\n| **4. Phase\u202fIII Clinical Trials (Large\u2011Scale Efficacy & Safety)** | \u2022 1,000\u201130,000 participants, recruited from many geographic sites. <br>\u2022 Randomized, double\u2011blind, **placebo\u2011 or active\u2011controlled** design. <br>\u2022 Follow\u2011up for **years** to capture both short\u2011 and longer\u2011term outcomes. | \u2022 **Primary efficacy endpoint**: reduction in the disease (clinical cases, laboratory\u2011confirmed infection). <br>\u2022 **Safety endpoint**: incidence of serious adverse events, rare events (e.g., seizures, allergic reactions). <br>\u2022 **Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs)** independently review interim data and can stop the trial early for safety concerns. | 2\u202f\u2013\u202f5\u202fyears (sometimes longer for diseases that are rare). |\n| **5. Regulatory Review & Licensure** | \u2022 Agencies such as the U.S. FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO Pre\u2011Qualification Programme, and national regulatory bodies examine the full data package. | \u2022 **Benefit\u2011risk assessment**: does the vaccine\u2019s protection outweigh the documented risks? <br>\u2022 **Manufacturing inspections**: ensure consistent production, sterility, and potency. | 6\u202fmonths\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202fyear (depends on the agency and priority status). |\n| **6. Post\u2011Marketing Surveillance (Phase\u202fIV)** | \u2022 After licensure, the vaccine is administered to millions of children. | \u2022 **Passive systems** \u2013 e.g., VAERS (U.S.), Yellow Card (UK). Anyone can report an event; signals are investigated. <br>\u2022 **Active systems** \u2013 e.g., Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), Sentinel, and WHO\u2019s Global Vaccine Safety Initiative. They use electronic health records to compare rates of specific outcomes in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated cohorts. <br>\u2022 **Pharmacovigilance studies** can detect **rare events** (1\u201110 per 100,000) that Phase\u202fIII trials cannot power for. | Ongoing for the product\u2019s life\u2011",

From Concept to Pre\u2011clinical Testing (1990\u20111995)\n\n| **Milestone** | **What Was Done** | **Safety Findings** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Target disease** | Rotavirus causes severe dehydrating gastroenteritis, especially in children\u202f<\u202f2\u202fy. Worldwide >\u202f100\u202f000 deaths/yr before the vaccine. | No vaccine existed; a high unmet need. |\n| **Vaccine design** | A **pentavalent, live\u2011attenuated** reassortant virus containing five human rotavirus (G1, G2, G3, G4, P[8]) strains combined with the bovine WC3 backbone. The bovine strain is naturally less pathogenic in humans, giving a safety \u201cbuffer.\u201d | In vitro studies showed limited replication in human intestinal cells compared with wild\u2011type virus. |\n| **Animal studies** | Tested in mice, guinea\u2011pigs, and gnotobiotic (germ\u2011free) piglets \u2013 the latter are the most predictive model for human rotavirus disease. | No deaths, no systemic infection, only mild, transient diarrhea at the highest doses. Pathology showed no viral shedding beyond the gut lumen. |\n\n*Result*: The pre\u2011clinical package satisfied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) that the candidate merited human testing.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Phase\u202fI \u2013 First\u2011in\u2011Human (1995\u20111996)\n\n* **Design** \u2013 30 healthy adult volunteers received a single oral dose (\u224810\u2076\u202fFFU) of each of the five reassortant strains, staggered over 5\u202fdays.  \n* **Primary safety end\u2011points** \u2013 Immediate adverse events (vomiting, fever, allergic reaction), labs (CBC, liver enzymes), and stool viral shedding.  \n* **Results** \u2013  \n\n| Outcome | Observation |\n|---|---|\n| Local/reactogenicity | Mild, self\u2011limited abdominal cramping in 2/30 (\u22487\u202f%). |\n| Systemic | No fever\u202f>\u202f38\u202f\u00b0C, no rash, no allergic reaction. |\n| Viral shedding | Detected in stool for \u2264\u202f3\u202fdays; titres <\u202f10\u00b3\u202fFFU, far below wild\u2011type infection. |\n| Labs | No abnormal CBC, liver, or renal values. |\n\n*Conclusion*: The vaccine was **well tolerated** in adults, allowing progression to pediatric trials.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Phase\u202fII \u2013 Dose\u2011Finding & Early Pediatric Safety (1996\u20111998)\n\n* **Population** \u2013 400 infants, aged\u202f6\u201112\u202fweeks, randomized to three dose levels (low, medium, high) or placebo. Three doses were given at 2\u2011month intervals (2,\u202f4,\u202f6\u202fmonths of age).  \n* **Key safety measures** \u2013  \n\n  * Solicited reactions (vomiting, diarrhea, fever) recorded for 7\u202fdays after each dose.  \n  * Unsolicited adverse events up to 30\u202fdays.  \n  * Stool shedding and seroconversion (IgA anti\u2011rotavirus).  \n\n* **Findings** \u2013  \n\n| Safety outcome | Low dose | Medium dose | High dose |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Fever\u202f\u2265\u202f38\u202f\u00b0C (within 7\u202fd)",

They file a VAERS report electronically, describing the event, timing, other illnesses, and the vaccine lot. | In 2006, several physicians reported cases of **intussusception** occurring 3\u20117\u202fdays after the first dose of RotaTeq. |\n| **Data cleaning & de\u2011duplication** | VAERS staff (CDC\u2019s\u202fVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System team) remove duplicate entries, code the medical terms (using MedDRA), and assign seriousness levels (e.g., hospitalization, death). | The 2006 cases were entered as \u201cserious,\u201d because all required hospitalization. |\n| **Signal detection** | Analysts run **disproportionality statistics** (e.g., proportional reporting ratio, PRR; Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, BCPNN).
