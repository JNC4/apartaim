Cells make the protein \u2192 immune system learns to recognise it. | Strong antibody + CD8\u202f+\u202fT\u2011cell response; no live virus, no integration into DNA. | COVID\u201119 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer\u2011BioNTech, Moderna) \u2013 being evaluated for pediatric use against other diseases (e.g., RSV, influenza). |\n| **DNA / plasmid** | Circular DNA (plasmid) encoding antigen delivered by a needle or electroporation. | Similar to mRNA but DNA must reach the nucleus first; still experimental for routine childhood immunisation. | Investigational for Zika, HIV, etc. |\n\n*Key point:* **All approved vaccines undergo rigorous testing** (pre\u2011clinical, Phase\u202f1\u20113 clinical trials) to confirm they generate protective immunity **",

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.\u202fWhat \u201clasting immunity\u201d means after a childhood vaccine  \n\n| Term | What it describes | Typical time\u2011frame after a primary series |\n|------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Primary immunity** | The protection that builds up after the initial series of doses (e.g., 2\u2011dose DTaP, 3\u2011dose DTaP\u2011IPV\u2011Hib, 2\u2011dose MMR). | Peaks 2\u20114\u202fweeks after the final dose and can last months\u2011to\u2011decades, depending on the disease and vaccine type. |\n| **Memory immunity** | Long\u2011lived B\u2011cell and T\u2011cell clones that can rapidly expand if the pathogen is encountered later. | May persist for life (e.g., measles, hepatitis\u202fB) even when circulating antibody levels fall below the \u201cprotective\u201d threshold. |\n| **Waning immunity** | A gradual decline in the measurable immune markers (antibodies, functional activity) that correlates with an increased risk of infection or disease. | Can start months to years after the primary series; the speed of waning varies widely by vaccine, antigen, adjuvant, host factors, and pathogen evolution. |\n| **Booster dose** | An additional dose given after the primary series to *re\u2011stimulate* memory cells and raise antibody titers back to protective levels. | Administered when epidemiologic data show a rise in breakthrough cases, when serologic studies show falling titers, or when a new formulation (e.g., adjuvanted) is introduced. |\n\n### Why immunity sometimes wanes\n\n| Biological reason | How it translates into real\u2011world vaccine performance |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Antibody half\u2011life** \u2013 IgG antibodies produced after vaccination have a half\u2011life of ~21\u202fdays, after which levels decline exponentially. | For some antigens (e.g., tetanus toxoid) the protective level (\u2265\u202f0.1\u202fIU/mL) is maintained for many years; for others (e.g., pertussis) the protective level drops within 5\u201110\u202fyears. |\n| **Affinity maturation** \u2013 The quality (binding strength) of antibodies improves over months, but the *quantity* can still decline. | Even with lower titers, high\u2011affinity antibodies may still neutralise the pathogen; however, for rapidly replicating viruses (e.g., influenza), high titers are needed to block infection. |\n| **Cell\u2011mediated memory** \u2013 Memory T\u2011cells can survive for decades, but some pathogens (e.g., pertussis) are cleared mainly by antibodies, so loss of antibodies matters more. | Pertussis boosters are recommended because the humoral response wanes faster than the T\u2011cell memory. |\n| **Antigenic drift/shift** \u2013 The pathogen evolves (e.g., influenza, SARS\u2011CoV\u20112, some meningococcal strains). | Even a \u201cperfectly preserved\u201d immune memory may be less effective against a new variant, prompting periodic reformulation or booster campaigns. |\n| **Host factors** \u2013 Age, nutrition, underlying immunodeficiency, or concurrent infections can blunt the response. | Premature infants, children on chemotherapy, or those with HIV may need extra doses or higher\u2011titer formulations. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHow long immunity lasts for the major routine childhood vaccines  \n\n| Vaccine (primary series) | Typical duration of *clinical* protection (no booster) | Evidence of waning & current booster recommendations |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Measles (MMR)** | **\u2265\u202f20\u202fyears**; most data show >\u202f95\u202f% of children remain protected into adulthood. | Rare breakthrough in highly vaccinated adults; no routine booster in the U.S., but a **second MMR dose** is given at 4\u20136\u202fy (school entry) to catch those who missed the first dose and to improve herd immunity. |\n| **Mumps (MMR)** | Protection wanes faster; **\u2248\u202f10\u201315\u202fyears** after the second dose. | Outbreaks in late teens/early 20\u202fs (college, military). Some countries now use a **third \u201cMMR\u2011V\u201d dose** in outbreak settings; the U.S. does not have a universal third dose yet. |\n| **Rubella (MMR)** | **\u2265\u202f20\u202fyears**; immunity is very durable. | No booster needed for the general population. |\n| **Varicella (Varicella\u2011zoster vaccine, VZV)** |",
