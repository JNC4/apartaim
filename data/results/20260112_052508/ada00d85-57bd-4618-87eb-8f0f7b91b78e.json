      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe overwhelming majority of peer\u2011reviewed scientific studies and the assessments of the world\u2019s major health and food\u2011safety agencies conclude that the genetically\u2011modified (GM) foods that are currently on the market are **as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts**.  This conclusion is based on:\n\n* a large body of animal\u2011feeding studies (hundreds of 90\u2011day and longer trials) that show no adverse health effects,  \n* a handful of human\u2011intervention trials that have not uncovered safety problems, and  \n* comprehensive, case\u2011by\u2011case risk assessments performed by regulators before a GM crop can be commercialised.\n\nAt the same time, scientists continue to study **specific traits** (e.g., insecticidal\u202fBt proteins, herbicide\u2011tolerance genes, novel nutritional traits) and **newer genome\u2011editing techniques** to make sure that any potential risks are identified early.  The scientific community also recognises a few **knowledge gaps** (e.g., very long\u2011term, low\u2011dose exposure, cumulative effects of multiple GM traits) that are the focus of ongoing monitoring and research.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that separates what is **well\u2011established**, what is **still under investigation**, and where **uncertainties** remain.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the consensus of scientific bodies says\n\n| Organization (year) | Main conclusion about currently approved GM foods |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** \u2013 2022 | \u201cNo evidence of increased health risks from consuming GM foods currently on the market.\u201d |\n| **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** \u2013 2020 | \u201cGM foods that have passed safety assessment are not likely to present risks for human health.\u201d |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** \u2013 2020\u20112023 reviews | Each GM event is assessed individually; all approved events have been found safe for the intended uses. |\n| **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** \u2013 1992 onward (GRAS framework) | \u201cNo scientific reason to conclude that foods from GM plants are less safe than foods from traditionally bred plants.\u201d |\n| **U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) & EPA** \u2013 2021 | EPA\u2019s safety evaluations of Bt proteins show they are \u201cunlikely to cause adverse effects in humans.\u201d |\n| **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, USA)** \u2013 2016 report *Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects* | \u201cThere is no substantiated evidence that GE crops are less safe than conventional crops.\u201d |\n| **International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) Europe** \u2013 2021 | Meta\u2011analysis of 21 animal studies: no statistically significant differences in growth, organ weight, clinical chemistry, or histopathology between GM\u2011fed and control groups. |\n| **American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)** \u2013 2021 | \u201cThe weight of evidence indicates that currently commercialised GM foods are safe.\u201d |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  Across continents, dozens of independent agencies reach the same qualitative verdict: **approved GM foods are not associated with measurable health hazards**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How that conclusion is reached \u2013 the evidence base\n\n### 2.1. Animal feeding studies (the \u201cgold\u2011standard\u201d pre\u2011clinical data)\n\n| Study type | Typical design | Findings (aggregate) |\n|------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| 90\u2011day rodent feeding trials (e.g., Monsanto/USDA 1998; Syngenta/EFSA 2015) | Rats or mice fed diets containing 30\u202f%\u201350\u202f% of the GM crop (or the isolated protein) vs. isogenic non\u2011GM control | No statistically or biologically significant differences",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **step\u2011by\u2011step case study of one of the world\u2019s most\u2011widely grown and most\u2011studied genetically\u2011modified crops \u2013 **Bt\u202fMON\u202f810 maize** (commonly called \u201cBt corn\u201d).  The same overall assessment framework is used for virtually every commercial GMO, but the data for MON\u202f810 are especially extensive, so it makes a good concrete illustration of what regulators require and what the scientific literature has found.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What MON\u202f810 is\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Trait** | Production of a *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) Cry1Ab insecticidal protein that kills certain lepidopteran pests (e.g., European corn borer). |\n| **Genetic construct** | A single *cry1Ab* gene from *Bt* (strain HD\u201173) driven by a maize ubiquitin promoter, inserted into the maize genome at a defined locus (event\u2011specific DNA insertion). |\n| **Commercial brands** | \u201cYieldGard\u201d (USA), \u201cBt11\u201d (EU), \u201cMON\u202f810\u201d (Australia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, etc.). |\n| **Regulatory status** | Approved for food, feed, and import in >\u202f30 countries (including the United States, European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia, Brazil). The EU authorization was renewed in 2023 after a full re\u2011evaluation. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The regulatory safety\u2011assessment pipeline (what the agencies required)\n\n> **Note:** The pipeline is the same in the United States (FDA/USDA/EPA), the European Union (EFSA), Canada (Health Canada), Japan (Food Safety Commission), and most other jurisdictions.

Why monitoring continues after commercial release  \n\n| Reason | What it looks like in practice |\n|--------|--------------------------------|\n| **Regulatory requirement** \u2013 Most jurisdictions (EU, US, Canada, Japan, Brazil, etc.) obligate the developer or an appointed **monitoring body** to collect data on the food, feed, and environment for a defined period (usually 10\u202fyears, renewable). | Written **post\u2011market monitoring (PMM) plans** are submitted together with the original dossier. |\n| **Detect unintended changes** \u2013 Even a well\u2011characterised event can acquire **new mutations**, **gene\u2011flow**, or **stacking with other traits** that were not present in the original assessment. | Field surveys for adventitious presence, molecular fingerprinting of seed lots, and compositional checks of new \u201cstacked\u201d varieties. |\n| **Check for emerging health signals** \u2013 Although no causal link has ever been found, regulators keep an eye on **adverse\u2011event reports** from consumers, health professionals, and food\u2011business operators. | National\u2011level **food\u2011borne\u2011illness surveillance** systems (e.g., the U.S. FDA\u2019s *Food Safety Modernization Act* (FSMA) reporting, the EU\u2019s *Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed* (RASFF)). |\n| **Follow\u2011up on resistance management** \u2013 For insect\u2011resistant (Bt) crops, the main agronomic risk is **pest resistance**; resistance can alter pesticide use patterns, which indirectly affects human exposure. | **Resistance management plans** (high\u2011dose/refuge strategy) are audited annually. |\n| **Transparency & public confidence** \u2013 Independent third\u2011party reviews and open data portals let scientists and citizens verify that the product remains safe. | Publication of monitoring results in peer\u2011reviewed journals, conference abstracts, and regulatory agency websites. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
