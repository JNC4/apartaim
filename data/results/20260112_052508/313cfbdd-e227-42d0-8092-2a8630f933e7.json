Theoretical pathways from QE \u2192 jobs \u2192 wages  \n\n| Channel | How QE works | Why it could matter for low\u2011income workers | Possible limits / frictions |\n|---------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **1. Aggregate\u2011demand (AD) boost** | By lowering long\u2011term rates, QE makes borrowing cheaper for firms and households, encouraging investment and consumption. Higher demand \u2192 firms raise output \u2192 need more workers. | Low\u2011skill sectors (retail, hospitality, personal services, construction) are usually the first to expand when overall demand rises because they are *capacity\u2011elastic* (they can hire quickly rather than build new factories). | If firms anticipate a short\u2011lived stimulus, they may prefer overtime or temporary contracts instead of permanent hires. If the economy is already near full\u2011employment, the extra demand mainly pushes up prices rather than employment. |\n| **2. Credit\u2011availability / balance\u2011sheet channel** | QE improves banks\u2019 capital and liquidity, making them more willing to extend business loans, especially to small\u2011 and medium\u2011size enterprises (SMEs). | SMEs are disproportionately owned by, and employ, low\u2011skill workers. More credit \u2192 more expansion \u2192 more hiring. | After the 2008 crisis many banks tightened underwriting standards; the extra liquidity sometimes stayed on the balance sheet rather than flowing to marginal borrowers. |\n| **3. Exchange\u2011rate / export channel** | Lower yields can depreciate the domestic currency, making exports cheaper and boosting foreign\u2011demand for domestically produced goods. | Export\u2011oriented manufacturing (e.g., apparel, electronics assembly) often uses relatively low\u2011skill labor, so a weaker currency can raise production and hiring in those plants. | The depreciation effect is weaker when the QE\u2011inducing central bank is a \u201cglobal lender of last resort\u201d (e.g., the Fed) because other major central banks may also be easing, limiting relative currency moves. |\n| **4. Expectations / confidence channel** | The central bank\u2019s explicit commitment to keep financing conditions easy reduces \u201cpolicy uncertainty.\u201d Firms are more willing to start new projects. | Confidence helps firms that were on the fence about hiring. | Confidence can be uneven; firms that are already cash\u2011rich may not need the extra reassurance. |\n| **5. Asset\u2011price / wealth channel** | QE lifts stock prices and house values, increasing the net worth of owners (who tend to be higher\u2011income). Higher wealth can translate into higher consumer spending. | If low\u2011income workers receive **wage\u2011linked bonuses**, overtime pay, or **government transfers** that are tied to overall economic growth, they can indirectly benefit. | The wealth channel is *distributionally skewed*: most low\u2011income households have little financial assets, so the direct boost is small. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.

The three transmission channels that can affect jobs and wages  \n\n| Channel | What QE does | How that can reach the labor market | Typical time\u2011lag |\n|---------|--------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **(A) Portfolio\u2011balance / asset\u2011price channel** | By buying Treasury bonds (and sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities) the central bank pushes up prices of those assets and pushes down their yields. | Higher asset prices raise the net worth of **households that own financial assets** (stocks, bonds, housing).  Higher net\u2011worth can increase **consumer confidence and spending**, which raises demand for labor, especially in sectors that produce consumer goods and services. | 6\u201112\u202fmonths for the wealth effect to feed through consumption. |\n| **(B) Credit\u2011allocation / liquidity channel** | Banks receive large reserves when the central bank purchases assets; the \u201cexcess reserves\u201d can be lent out, and the lower long\u2011term rates make borrowing cheaper for firms and households. | Firms can finance **new investment projects** (plant, equipment, R&D) or **expand existing operations**.  Lower borrowing costs also make it cheaper for **small\u2011 and medium\u2011sized enterprises (SMEs)** to obtain working\u2011capital loans, which are often the biggest employers of low\u2011skill labor. | 3\u20119\u202fmonths for loan\u2011growth to translate into hiring; up to 2\u202fyears for large capital projects. |\n| **(C) Expectations / exchange\u2011rate channel** | QE signals that the central bank will keep policy \u201caccommodative\u201d for an extended period, raising expectations of higher future inflation and a weaker currency. | A weaker domestic currency makes **export\u2011oriented industries** more competitive, potentially expanding jobs in manufacturing, logistics, and related services that employ many low\u2011skill workers.  Higher inflation expectations can also prompt workers to **negotiate higher nominal wages** if they expect price rises. | 6\u201118\u202fmonths for exchange\u2011rate effects to affect export volumes. |\n\n> **Key point:**  The **credit\u2011allocation channel** is the one most directly linked to **job creation for low\u2011income workers**, because it lowers the cost of borrowing for the firms that actually hire them (SMEs, construction firms, retail chains).  The **portfolio\u2011balance channel** primarily benefits asset owners (who are disproportionately higher\u2011income), while the **expectations channel** can have mixed effects depending on the industry mix of an economy.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
