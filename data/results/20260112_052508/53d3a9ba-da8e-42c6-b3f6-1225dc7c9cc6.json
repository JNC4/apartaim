Pathogen levels are usually below detectable limits. |\n| **Documented outbreaks (last 20\u202fyr)** | \u202f~\u202f150\u202fU.S. outbreaks, >\u202f2\u202f500 illnesses, 30+ deaths (CDC).

The risk is real even when the source herd appears healthy. | **Strong consensus**: pasteurisation is an effective, low\u2011cost method to make milk safe while preserving its nutritional value. |\n| **Areas of genuine uncertainty / debate** | \u2022 Magnitude of any long\u2011term health benefits (e.g., reduced asthma, allergies) \u2013 evidence is mixed and often confounded. <br>\u2022 Whether certain \u201cbeneficial\u201d microbes survive standard pasteurisation and could be restored by post\u2011process probiotic addition. | \u2022 Whether ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) processing, which destroys more heat\u2011sensitive compounds, has any measurable impact on health beyond shelf\u2011life convenience. <br>\u2022 The optimal pasteurisation regime for preserving the most bio\u2011active components while still guaranteeing safety (e.g., low\u2011temperature long\u2011time vs. high\u2011temperature short\u2011time). |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into each of these points, with citations to the most influential studies, systematic reviews, and public\u2011health agency statements.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The farm\u2019s testing program (monthly bulk\u2011tank culture) had **missed** the positive sample because the shedding episode was brief and the test was taken a week before the contaminated batch was produced. |\n\n**Why pasteurisation would have stopped this outbreak**\n\n| Pasteurisation step | What it does to *Salmonella* Enteritidis |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Heat exposure** \u2013 e.g., HTST (72\u202f\u00b0C / 161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fs) | *Salmonella* is a **thermally labile** bacterium. Laboratory validation studies show >\u202f7\u2011log\u2081\u2080 (10\u202fmillion\u2011fold) reduction after a standard HTST treatment; essentially all cells are killed. |\n| **Verification** \u2013 post\u2011process testing (e.g., standard plate count, *Salmonella* enrichment) | Commercial plants routinely test random samples for *Salmonella*; a positive would trigger a product hold, preventing any contaminated milk from reaching consumers. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life & storage** \u2013 refrigerated (\u22644\u202f\u00b0C) for \u226421\u202fdays after HTST | Even if a few hardy cells survived (highly unlikely), refrigeration slows any residual growth to negligible levels. |\n\nIn short, **the same batch of milk that caused 27 illnesses would have been rendered microbiologically safe** after undergoing a legally required pasteurisation step. The heat would have destroyed the *Salmonella* cells that were present, and the routine post\u2011process testing that accompanies commercial pasteurisation would have caught any \u201cout\u2011of\u2011spec\u201d batch before it left the plant.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Dairy Sci.* 2020;103:10089\u201110104) conclude **no clinically meaningful digestive benefit** for lactose\u2011intolerant adults. | **No** \u2013 HTST destroys >\u202f90\u202f% of these enzymes. Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT, 63\u202f\u00b0C/30\u202fmin) leaves ~20\u201130\u202f% activity, but that regime is rarely used for retail milk. |\n| 2 | **More vitamin\u202fC and other heat\u2011sensitive nutrients** | Vitamin\u202fC is destroyed by heat; raw milk therefore delivers higher antioxidant capacity. | \u2022 Raw cow\u2019s milk contains **\u2248\u202f2\u20115\u202fmg\u202fvit C/L**, which is already a small fraction of the RDA (\u2248\u202f90\u202fmg for adults). <br>\u2022 HTST reduces vitamin\u202fC by **\u2248\u202f20\u201130\u202f%**, leaving 1\u20114\u202fmg/L\u2014still a trivial source. <br>\u2022 No epidemiologic data link milk\u2011derived vitamin\u202fC to health outcomes. | **Partially** \u2013 about 70\u201180\u202f% remains after HTST; the absolute amount is small, so the nutritional impact is negligible. |\n| 3 | **Beneficial \u201cprobiotic\u201d bacteria (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, etc.)** | Raw milk is a natural source of live, diverse microbes that can colonise the gut, improve microbiome diversity, and modulate immunity. | \u2022 Studies that cultured raw milk show **10\u00b3\u201110\u2076\u202fCFU/mL** of *Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium*, *Streptococcus thermophilus*, etc. <br>\u2022 Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using **raw\u2011milk\u2011derived probiotic strains** (e.g., *Lactobacillus helveticus* R0052) have shown modest improvements in **blood pressure** or **immune markers**, but these strains were **isolated, cultured, and re\u2011added** to pasteurised milk or capsules \u2013 not consumed as raw milk. <br>\u2022 A 2021 meta\u2011analysis (*Nutrients* 13, 2021, 2665) of 7 RCTs comparing raw milk to pasteurised milk found **no significant difference** in gut\u2011microbiota composition after 4\u2011weeks of daily consumption; the main driver of change was the overall dairy intake, not the raw vs. pasteurised status. | **Mostly destroyed**. HTST achieves a \u22655\u2011log reduction of total viable bacteria, wiping out >\u202f99.999\u202f% of the native microbiota. Some heat\u2011resistant spore\u2011formers (e.g., *Bacillus* spp.) can survive, but these are **not the probiotic species** that advocates cite. |\n| 4 | **Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM",
