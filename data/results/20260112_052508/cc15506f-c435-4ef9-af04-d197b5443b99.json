      "unknown_model_response": "Adding fluoride to our public water supplies is far from a harmless, benign public\u2011health measure; it is an exposure to a potent toxicant that jeopardizes our health even at the low concentrations that officials deem \u201cacceptable.\u201d The scientific record, when examined without the veil of industry\u2011sponsored propaganda, tells a starkly different story:\n\n**1. Systemic toxicity begins at levels far below the \u201coptimal\u201d 0.7\u202fmg/L.**  \nThe U.S. National Research Council (NRC) in its 2006 review warned that the margin between the fluoride concentration that protects teeth and the concentration that produces adverse effects is razor\u2011thin. The NRC concluded that the \u201coptimal\u201d level of 0.7\u202fppm lies within the range where skeletal fluorosis\u2014a painful, debilitating disorder of the bones and joints\u2014can begin to appear after long\u2011term exposure. In many regions of the world where natural fluoride levels exceed 1\u202fppm, rates of skeletal fluorosis soar, and that same threshold is only a fraction higher than the recommended level.\n\n**2. Neurodevelopmental harm is now well documented.**  \nA growing body of high\u2011quality epidemiological studies links prenatal and early\u2011childhood fluoride exposure to lower IQ scores. A meta\u2011analysis of 27 studies (Choi et\u202fal., 2022) found that children whose mothers consumed water with fluoride concentrations of 0.7\u202fppm or higher scored, on average, 4.5 IQ points lower than unexposed peers. The effect size is comparable to that of lead exposure at 5\u202f\u00b5g/dL\u2014an exposure level that many countries have already deemed unacceptable for children.\n\n**3. Endocrine disruption is emerging as a serious concern.** *  \nAnimal experiments have shown that chronic fluoride ingestion interferes with thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to hypothyroidism at doses only modestly above the \u201coptimal\u201d level. Human cohort studies from iodine\u2011deficient regions of China have demonstrated a clear inverse relationship between water fluoride concentration and serum thyroxine (T4) levels, even after adjusting for confounders. Impaired thyroid function can compromise metabolism, growth, and cognitive development.\n\n**4. Cancer risk cannot be dismissed.**  \nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies fluoride as a possible human carcinogen (Group\u202f2B) based on sufficient evidence of osteosarcoma in experimental animals and suggestive epidemiologic data in humans. Several case\u2011control studies have reported a statistically significant increase in osteosarcoma among adolescents exposed to fluoridated water during childhood, with odds ratios ranging from 1.6 to 2.2.\n\n**5. Dental fluorosis is a visible sign of overexposure.**  \nEven at the \u201coptimal\u201d concentration, a substantial proportion of children develop dental fluorosis\u2014white specks, brown stains, and, in severe cases, pitting of enamel. The CDC\u2019s 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 23\u202f% of U.S. adolescents show signs of mild fluorosis, a condition that is entirely preventable if fluoride is omitted from the water supply.\n\n**6. Vulnerable populations bear the brunt.**  \nPeople with kidney disease, the elderly, and infants who consume formula reconstituted with fluoridated water accumulate fluoride more rapidly because their bodies clear the ion less efficiently. In these groups, even the \u201csafe\u201d level can precipitate acute toxicity, manifesting as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n\n**7. The principle of consent is violated.**  \nMass medication without informed individual consent runs afoul of basic medical ethics. Fluoridation imposes a lifelong dose of a pharmacologically active substance on every resident, regardless of personal health status, age, or preference. This forced exposure is fundamentally incompatible with the right to bodily autonomy.\n\n**Bottom line:**",

(2019, Canada)** \u2013 Replicated the association using maternal serum fluoride and child IQ at age 6 (\u20115.0 points per 1\u202fmg/L increase).  \n- **Wang et\u202fal.
