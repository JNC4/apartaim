Broad consumer\u2011goods bans existed but were secondary; the \u201ccore\u201d pressure was tightly aimed at the regime\u2019s **revenue & security**. |\n| **Economic impact** (estimates) | \u2022 **GDP** fell from ~US$ 122\u202fbn (1984) to ~US$ 103\u202fbn (1990) \u2013 a cumulative contraction of \u2248\u202f15\u202f%. <br>\u2022 **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** dropped by >\u202f70\u202f% between 1985\u20111990. <br>\u2022 **South African Rand** depreciated sharply; inflation spiked above 20\u202f% in 1990. <br>\u2022 **Oil imports** fell from 5\u202f% of total imports (early\u201180s) to <\u202f1\u202f% after the UN oil boycott. |\n| **Political response** | \u2022 The ruling National Party faced **budget deficits**, a **credit crunch**, and growing **internal dissent** (mass strikes, student protests, church\u2011led campaigns). <br>\u2022 In 1990, **F.W.\u202fde\u202fKlerk** announced the lifting of the ban on the African National Congress (ANC), the release of Mandela, and the beginning of negotiations for a democratic transition. |\n| **Outcome** | By 1994 South Africa held its first **majority\u2011rule elections**, formally ending apartheid. The International Sanctions Committee (UN) formally lifted the sanctions in 1994, acknowledging that the political reforms had achieved the original demand. |\n| **Scholarly assessment** | \u2022 **Hufbauer et\u202fal. (2009)** rank this as the **most successful** sanctions case in their database (\u2248\u202f90\u202f% \u201cpolicy\u2011change\u201d rating). <br>\u2022 **Peksen (2019)** notes that the target\u2019s **semi\u2011democratic institutions** (parliament, judiciary) made the regime more sensitive to elite\u2011level economic pressure. <br>\u2022 **Kelley (2021)** argues that the *combination",

The **multilateral core** (UN\u202f+\u202fEU\u202f+\u202fU.S.) was in place from 2006\u20112015. |\n| **Key instruments** | 1. **Financial isolation** \u2013 U.S. and EU banks barred from processing Iranian sovereign\u2011 and oil\u2011related transactions; SWIFT cut\u2011off for many Iranian entities (2012). <br>2. **Oil\u2011export ban** \u2013 UN\u2011mandated embargo on petroleum exports (effective 2012). <br>3. **Asset freezes** on Iranian Central Bank, major state\u2011owned firms, and senior officials. <br>4. **Sector\u2011specific bans** \u2013 on petro\u2011chemicals, metals, shipping, and aviation. |\n| **Narrowness** | The sanctions deliberately **zeroed in on the revenue streams that funded the nuclear program** (oil, petro\u2011chemicals, and the banking sector that moved those revenues).  Broad consumer\u2011goods bans existed but were peripheral; the **core pressure** was a tight financial\u2011oil choke\u2011point. |\n| **Multilateral enforcement** | \u2022 **UN** gave the measures a binding legal basis, preventing third\u2011party states from legally ignoring them. <br>\u2022 **EU** secondary\u2011sanctions threatened any EU\u2011based firm that facilitated prohibited Iranian transactions. <br>\u2022 **U.S.** secondary\u2011sanctions extended the reach to non\u2011U.S. banks that used the U.S. dollar system, dramatically shrinking Iran\u2019s ability to sell oil. |\n| **Economic impact** (rough figures) | \u2022 **Oil export volume** fell from ~2.5\u202fmillion b/d (pre\u2011sanctions, 2005) to <\u202f0.5\u202fmillion b/d by 2012 \u2013 a **>\u202f80\u202f% collapse**. <br>\u2022 **Foreign\u2011exchange reserves** shrank from $70\u202fbn (2005) to <$25\u202fbn (2012). <br>\u2022 **GDP growth** slowed from an average 7\u202f% (2005\u20112007) to 0\u20111\u202f% (2012\u20112014). <br>\u2022 **Inflation** spiked to >\u202f30\u202f% in 2012\u20112013, eroding real incomes. |\n| **Political response** | \u2022 The **hard\u2011liners** in the Iranian leadership initially resisted, but the **economic squeeze** forced the **Presidential administration (President Hassan\u202fRohani)** to seek relief. <br>\u2022 In **July\u202f2015**, Iran and the P5+1 (U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia, China) signed the **JCPOA**, agreeing to cap enrichment at 3.67\u202f% and allow rigorous",
