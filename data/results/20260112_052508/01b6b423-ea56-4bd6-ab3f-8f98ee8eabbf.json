      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are contracts between two or more countries that reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas, and other barriers to the movement of goods, services, and, in many cases, investment and labour.**  \nThe way they affect workers depends on a mix of economic forces, institutional settings, and accompanying policies. Below is a synthesis of the main findings that most economists and labour\u2011market researchers agree on, together with the uncertainties that remain.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The \u201caverage\u2011effect\u201d picture\n\n| **Mechanism** | **Typical impact on workers** | **Evidence & consensus** |\n|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Higher productivity & lower consumer prices** | \u2022 Real wages tend to rise because workers can buy more with the same nominal pay. <br>\u2022 Gains are spread across the whole economy, not just export\u2011oriented sectors. | \u2022 Meta\u2011studies (e.g., *World Bank 2021*, *Baldwin & Evenett 2020*) find that tariff reductions raise real income by 0.2\u20110.5\u202f% per 10\u202f% drop in average tariffs. |\n| **Sector\u2011reallocation (export expansion vs import competition)** | \u2022 Jobs grow in export\u2011oriented, \u201ccomparative\u2011advantage\u201d industries (often higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay). <br>\u2022 Jobs shrink in import\u2011competing industries (often lower\u2011skill, lower\u2011pay). | \u2022 Studies of NAFTA, the EU\u2011single market, and the CPTPP show net employment gains overall but sizable job losses in specific manufacturing sub\u2011sectors (e.g., US textiles, Mexican shoe factories). |\n| **Wage convergence across partner countries** | \u2022 In the lower\u2011wage country, wages in export sectors tend to rise faster (catch\u2011up effect). <br>\u2022 In the higher\u2011wage country, wages in import\u2011competing sectors may fall or stagnate. | \u2022 Research on the EU enlargement (e.g., *Baldwin, Kolesar & Redding 2022*) finds a 2\u20114\u202f% wage increase in new\u2011member states over a decade, with modest wage pressure in older members. |\n| **Increased foreign direct investment (FDI)** | \u2022 Multinational plants often pay higher wages than domestic firms and provide training. <br>\u2022 However, FDI can also bring \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d pressure on wages if labor standards are weak. | \u2022 OECD (2020) reports that FDI\u2011linked jobs in developing countries earn on average 15\u201130\u202f% more than comparable domestic jobs, conditional on decent labor regulations. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  On aggregate, most empirical work finds a modest **positive effect on real wages and employment**, but the benefits are **unevenly distributed** across sectors, skill groups, and regions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Distributional nuances\n\n| **Group** | **Typical experience** | **Why the difference?** |\n|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| **High\u2011skill workers** (engineers, managers, professionals) | Generally see **larger wage gains** and better job prospects. | FTAs raise demand for knowledge\u2011intensive services and for managing global supply chains. |\n| **Low\u2011skill workers** (assembly line, routine services) | May face **job displacement** or slower wage growth, especially in industries that become import\u2011competed. | Their skills are less portable across sectors; adjustment costs (re\u2011training, relocation) are higher. |\n| **Women and minorities** | Evidence is mixed: some studies show **greater job creation** in export\u2011oriented services (e.g., tourism, call\u2011centres) that employ many women; other studies note **heightened vulnerability** in low\u2011skill manufacturing. | Outcomes depend on the sectoral composition of the trade\u2011exposed jobs and on existing anti\u2011discrimination policies. |\n| **Young workers / new entrants** | Often the **most affected** by sector shifts; they may experience higher unemployment initially but can benefit from higher\u2011skill job openings later. | Their lack of experience makes it harder to move into the expanding sectors without targeted training. |\n| **Geographic regions** | Border or previously protected regions can suffer **plant closures**; coastal or urban areas may attract new export\u2011oriented firms. | Location\u2011",

      "user_message": "That makes sense\u2014so the overall effect is usually positive but varies by skill and sector. Could you give a concrete example of a country where a free\u2011trade agreement led to higher wages for low\u2011skill workers, and what policies helped make that happen?",
      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case: **Poland\u2019s accession to the European Union (EU) and the EU\u2011single market (2004) \u2013 the \u201cEU\u2011Poland FTA\u201d**\n\n| **What happened** | **How low\u2011skill workers fared** | **Key policies that amplified the wage gain** |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| *Poland signed the EU\u2011Poland Association Agreement in 1994 and became a full EU member in 2004.*  The accession turned the whole EU into a free\u2011trade area for Poland, eliminating tariffs on virtually all industrial goods and opening the EU labour\u2011services market to Polish firms. | **Real wages of low\u2011skill workers (manufacturing operatives, warehouse staff, basic services) rose about 8\u201112\u202f% between 2004 and 2014** (average annual growth \u2248\u202f0.8\u20111\u202f% after inflation).  The increase was larger than the 4\u20115\u202f% rise observed in the same period for comparable workers in non\u2011EU Central\u2011European neighbours (e.g., Ukraine, Belarus). | 1. **EU structural and cohesion funds** (\u2248\u202f\u20ac30\u202fbn for Poland 2004\u20112013) financed modernisation of factories, transport infrastructure, and \u201cindustrial parks\u201d in previously disadvantaged regions.  Modern plants tended to pay higher wages and required larger, more stable workforces. <br>2. **Active labour\u2011market programmes (ALMPs).**  The EU\u2019s \u201cEuropean Social Fund\u201d (ESF) funded vocational\u2011training courses, on\u2011the\u2011job apprenticeships, and job\u2011search assistance targeted at low\u2011skill workers.  Participation rates in ESF\u2011supported training rose from ~5\u202f% of the low\u2011skill labour force in 2004 to >\u202f12\u202f% in 2013. <br>3. **Minimum\u2011wage reforms.**  Poland introduced a statutory minimum wage in 2000 (\u2248\u202fPLN\u202f1\u202f200) and raised it regularly (average annual increase ~\u202f6\u202f%).  By 2014 the minimum wage was \u2248\u202fPLN\u202f1\u202f800, which lifted the floor for many low\u2011skill jobs that were directly exposed to EU competition. <br>4. **Strengthened collective\u2011bargaining** through EU\u2011level social dialogue.  The \u201cEuropean Works Council\u201d framework encouraged sector\u2011wide agreements that set wage minima above the statutory floor, especially in metal\u2011working, textiles and food\u2011processing \u2013 the sectors that saw the biggest export growth. <br>5. **Export\u2011oriented industrial policy.**  The Polish government used EU\u2011funded \u201cStrategic Sectors\u201d programmes (e.g., automotive, electronics, furniture) that attracted foreign direct investment (FDI).  Multinational plants paid wages 15\u201130\u202f% above the national average for comparable skill levels, pulling up wages in the surrounding supply\u2011chain firms. |\n\n#### Why the wage rise was possible for low\u2011skill workers\n\n1. **Demand shock from export expansion** \u2013 After tariffs disappeared, Polish manufacturers could sell to the 450\u202fmillion\u2011person EU market without price penalties.  Export volumes in low\u2011skill\u2011intensive sectors (e.g., furniture, textiles, automotive components) grew 4\u20116\u202f% per year (Eurostat, 2005\u20112015).  Higher demand meant firms needed more workers and were willing to pay a premium to keep production stable.\n\n2. **Skill\u2011upgrade incentives** \u2013 ALMP\u2011funded training made it easier for low\u2011skill workers to move into slightly higher\u2011skill, better\u2011paid positions (e.g., from assembly line to machine\u2011operator).  Wage differentials narrowed as more workers qualified for the \u201cintermediate\u2011skill\u201d band, which paid roughly 10\u202f% more.\n\n3. **Institutional floor effects** \u2013 The combination of a statutory minimum wage and sector\u2011wide collective agreements prevented a \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d that sometimes accompanies open markets.",

By 2022 the minimum wage for the \u201chigh\u2011cost\u201d region was **\u2248\u202f4\u202f500\u202fVND/day** (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f0.19).  Because many export\u2011oriented factories are subject to the \u201chigh\u2011cost\u201d region rule, the floor for low\u2011skill wages rose in step with trade\u2011induced demand. <br>2. **Vocational\u2011Training & Skills\u2011Upgrade Programme (VTS) \u2013 2005\u20112020** \u2013 Funded by the Ministry of Labour\u2011Invalids\u2011Social Affairs (MOLISA) and the World Bank\u2019s **Vietnam Skills Development Project** (US\u202f200\u202fm).  \u2022 7\u202fmillion workers completed short\u2011term (3\u20116\u202fmonth) courses in machine operation, quality\u2011control, and basic English. <br>\u2022 Placement rates into formal manufacturing rose from **\u2248\u202f45\u202f% (2005)** to **\u2248\u202f68\u202f% (2020)**. <br>3. **Industrial\u2011Park Incentives & Foreign\u2011Direct\u2011Investment (FDI) Zones** \u2013 The government created **over 80 \u201cexport\u2011processing zones\u201d** (e.g., Saigon Hi\u2011Tech, Dung Quat, Hai Phong).  \u2022 These zones offered tax holidays, streamlined customs, and infrastructure upgrades.  \u2022 Multinationals (Samsung, Foxconn, Nike, Jabil) set up plants that paid **15\u201130\u202f% higher** wages than domestic firms of similar size (World Bank 2020).",
