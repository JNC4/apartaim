The \u201cBt\u201d part stands for *Bacillus thuringiensis* \u2013 a soil bacterium that naturally makes an insect\u2011killing protein. The MON\u202f810 event (developed by Monsanto, now part of Bayer) carries a single gene that lets the corn plant produce the Cry1Ab protein in its leaf, stalk and kernel tissue, protecting the plant from the European corn borer and several other lepidopteran pests.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of how MON\u202f810 was evaluated for **human food safety** and why regulators (U.S. FDA, European Food Safety Authority\u202f(EFSA), Health Canada, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, etc.) have concluded that it is safe to eat.\n\n---  \n\n## 1.

The protocol is largely drawn from the **OECD Test Guideline\u202f408** (the internationally recognised \u201c90\u2011Day Oral Toxicity Study in Rodents\u201d) and from the **U.S. FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for Industry: Safety Evaluation of Food Ingredients\u201d**.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Test material preparation  \n\n1. **Test diet** \u2013 The GM crop (e.g., Bt corn grain) is milled into a fine flour and incorporated into a standard rodent diet at **three concentration levels**:  \n   * **Low dose** \u2013 roughly the **anticipated human exposure** (\u2248 the amount that would be consumed if the food made up 100\u202f% of the diet).  \n   * **Mid dose** \u2013 10\u202f\u00d7 the low dose.  \n   * **High dose** \u2013 100\u202f\u00d7 the low dose (or the maximum feasible concentration without compromising diet palatability).  \n\n2. **Control diet** \u2013 Identical formulation using the **near\u2011isogenic non\u2011GM counterpart** of the same variety, grown in the same region and harvested at the same time.  \n\n3. **Reference (positive) control** \u2013 Occasionally a diet spiked with a known toxicant (e.g., a low dose of a pesticide) to demonstrate that the test system can detect an effect; not required for every GMO.\n\n*All diets are analyzed for nutrient composition, moisture, mycotoxins, and the concentration of the novel protein (e.g., Cry1Ab) before the study starts.*\n\n---\n\n### 3. Study design and group allocation  \n\n| Group | Diet | Number of animals* | Duration |\n|-------|------|--------------------|----------|\n| **Control** | Non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic diet | 10 males\u202f+\u202f10 females (per OECD TG 408) | 90\u202fdays |\n| **Low** | GM diet, low concentration | 10\u202f+\u202f10 | 90\u202fdays |\n| **Mid** | GM diet, mid concentration | 10\u202f+\u202f10 | 90\u202fdays |\n| **High** | GM diet, high concentration | 10\u202f+\u202f10 | 90\u202fdays |\n| **Recovery (optional)** | High\u2011dose diet for 90\u202fdays, then switch to control diet for an additional 28\u202fdays | 5\u202f+\u202f5 | 118\u202fdays total |\n\n*The exact numbers can be higher (e.g., 20 per sex) if the sponsor wants more statistical power, but the OECD minimum is 10 per sex per group.*\n\nAnimals are **randomly assigned** to groups, housed in the same environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, 12\u202fh light/dark cycle), and **caged singly or in pairs** (depending on species) to allow individual feed intake measurement.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Dose\u2011selection rationale  \n\n* **Maximum feasible dose (MFD)** \u2013 the highest concentration that can be incorporated without causing diet refusal or nutrient imbalance; usually 10\u202f%\u201320\u202f% of the diet by weight.  \n* **Safety factor** \u2013 the high dose is deliberately **\u2265100\u202f\u00d7** the estimated human exposure (often 1\u202f% of total diet for a grain, so 100\u202f% of the diet would be the high dose).  \n* **No\u2011Observed\u2011Adverse\u2011Effect Level (NO",
