The few that exist (e.g., the \u201cPolyp Prevention Trial\u201d) focus on intermediate outcomes (adenomas) rather than cancer itself. |\n| **Mendelian\u2011randomisation (MR) studies** | Use genetic variants that influence meat consumption or related biomarkers (e.g., heme\u2011iron levels) as proxies for exposure. | Less prone to confounding because alleles are randomly assorted at conception. | Requires strong genetic instruments, and the variants often explain only a tiny fraction of dietary",
