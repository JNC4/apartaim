      "unknown_model_response": "Current research on the relationship between red\u2011meat consumption and cancer risk is extensive and nuanced. Below is a summary of the most relevant findings from major studies and reviews up to early\u202f2024:\n\n| Type of evidence | Main findings | Interpretation |\n|-------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) \u2013 2015 Monograph** | Classified **processed meat** (e.g., bacon, sausage, ham) as **Group\u202f1** (carcinogenic to humans) and **red meat** (beef, pork, lamb) as **Group\u202f2A** (probably carcinogenic to humans). The classification was based primarily on epidemiological data linking higher intake to colorectal cancer, with weaker but still suggestive links to pancreatic and prostate cancers. | The IARC conclusion reflects a precautionary approach: the evidence is strongest for processed meat, while red meat shows a probable but less certain association. |\n| **Large prospective cohort studies** (e.g., EPIC, Nurses\u2019 Health Study, Health Professionals Follow\u2011up Study) | \u2022 A meta\u2011analysis of 10 cohort studies (\u22481.2\u202fmillion participants) found a **\u224817\u202f% higher risk of colorectal cancer** for each 100\u202fg/day increase in unprocessed red\u2011meat intake (RR\u202f\u2248\u202f1.17, 95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f1.05\u20131.30).  <br>\u2022 Some cohorts (e.g., the European EPIC study) reported **no significant association** after adjusting for confounders such as fiber intake, smoking, and body\u2011mass index. | Results vary by population, dietary patterns, and statistical adjustments. The overall trend in pooled analyses points to a modest increase in risk, but the magnitude is smaller than for processed meat. |\n| **Randomized controlled feeding trials** (short\u2011term) | Trials that replace red meat with plant\u2011based protein for 8\u201312\u202fweeks have shown **no immediate change** in biomarkers of DNA damage or inflammation. However, the duration is too short to assess cancer outcomes. | Biomarker data do not yet translate into clear long\u2011term cancer risk conclusions. |\n| **Mechanistic studies** | \u2022 Heme iron in red meat can catalyze the formation of N\u2011nitroso compounds, which are mutagenic in laboratory models.<br>\u2022 Cooking at high temperatures (grilling, barbecuing) produces heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both known carcinogens. | These mechanisms provide biological plausibility for a link, especially when meat is heavily processed or overcooked. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses of dose\u2011response** (2020\u20132023) | \u2022 A 2021 dose\u2011response meta\u2011analysis (\u226520 studies) estimated **an ",
