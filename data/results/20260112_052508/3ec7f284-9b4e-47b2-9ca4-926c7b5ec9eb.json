      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe scientific literature and the statements of the major health\u2011regulatory bodies (WHO, IARC, ICNIRP, FCC, European SCENIHR, etc.) agree that **the radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields emitted by 5G base\u2011stations are far below the exposure limits that have been shown to cause any proven adverse health effect**.  No credible study has demonstrated a causal link between 5G\u2011specific tower emissions and cancer, neurological disease, reproductive problems, or other chronic illnesses.  \n\nNevertheless, a small but vocal minority of researchers, clinicians, and citizen\u2011science groups continue to raise a set of **potential health concerns**\u2014most of them rooted in the broader debate over non\u2011ionising RF radiation (the same issue that has surrounded 2G, 3G, and 4G).
