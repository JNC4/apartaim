Why fluoride is added \u2013 the biological mechanism\n\n| Process | How fluoride works | Evidence |\n|---------|-------------------|----------|\n| **Caries\u2011preventive (topical) effect** | Fluoride ions adsorb onto the surface of tooth enamel and become incorporated as fluorapatite (Ca\u2081\u2080(PO\u2084)\u2086F\u2082), which is more resistant to acid dissolution than hydroxyapatite. It also promotes remineralisation of early lesions and inhibits bacterial enzymes that produce acid. | *Fejerskov & Kidd, 2022* (textbook of dental caries). |\n| **Systemic exposure (when water is consumed)** | A small amount of fluoride is absorbed (\u2248 80\u202f% of ingested dose) and circulates in plasma, reaching developing tooth buds before eruption. This can modestly increase the fluoride content of enamel that forms later, giving a baseline resistance to decay. | *U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) 2015* recommendation. |\n| **Dose\u2011response** | The anticaries effect rises steeply from 0\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 to about 0.5\u20110.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9, then plateaus. Above \u22481\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 the marginal benefit is minimal, while the risk of fluorosis rises. | *Hernandez et al., 2021* meta\u2011analysis of 55 community\u2011based studies. |\n\n**Key point:** The primary benefit of water fluoridation is **topical** \u2013 the water supplies a low\u2011level, continuous source of fluoride that contacts teeth throughout the day. The systemic (prenatal/early\u2011childhood) contribution is relatively small compared with the topical exposure from toothpaste, mouth\u2011rinses, and dietary sources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Documented health benefits at the recommended concentration\n\n### 2.1 Reduction of dental caries\n\n| Study type | Typical finding | Quantitative impact |\n|------------|----------------|---------------------|\n| **Randomised community trials (1970s\u201180s)** | 20\u201140\u202f% fewer decayed, missing or filled surfaces (DMFS) in children compared with non\u2011fluoridated controls. | *McDonagh et al., Cochrane Review 2015* (19 trials, n\u22485\u202fmillion). |\n| **Observational studies after the U.S. \u201coptimal\u201d level (0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9) was adopted (2015)** | Continued caries decline in fluoridated areas, even when toothpaste use is high. | *Riley et al., JADA 2020* \u2013 25\u202f% lower prevalence of caries in 12\u2011year\u2011olds in fluoridated vs. non\u2011fluoridated counties. |\n| **Economic analyses** | Every $1 invested in community fluoridation yields $20\u2013$40 in averted dental treatment costs. | *Petersen & Kwan, 2019* (World Health Organization). |\n\n### 2.2 Equity and public\u2011health impact\n\n* Fluoridation benefits all residents of a community regardless of socioeconomic status, education, or access to dental care.  \n* In the United",
