      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect the jobs and wages of workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Overall employment:**  The bulk of empirical work finds that free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) do **not** cause large net gains or losses in total employment for the signatory economies as a whole.  \n- **Sectoral shifts:**  Jobs tend to move **from industries that lose comparative advantage** (often labor\u2011intensive, low\u2011skill manufacturing) **to those that gain** (higher\u2011skill manufacturing, services, and export\u2011oriented sectors).  \n- **Wages:**  The impact on wages is **mixed**.  Average wages may rise modestly in the long run because of higher productivity, but **distributional effects are pronounced**: workers in displaced sectors can see wage drops or job loss, while workers in expanding sectors may see wage gains.  \n\nThe details, however, depend on a country\u2019s level of development, the design of the agreement, the flexibility of its labor market, and accompanying policies (e.g., adjustment assistance, safety\u2011net programs, and labor\u2011rights clauses).\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that lays out the mechanisms, the main empirical findings, and the areas where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Economic mechanisms linking FTAs to jobs and wages\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical short\u2011run effect | Typical long\u2011run effect |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Comparative\u2011advantage reallocation** | Tariff removal makes imported goods cheaper and exports from the most productive sectors more competitive. | Firms in less\u2011competitive sectors cut output or shut down \u2192 job losses in those sectors. | Resources (labor, capital) migrate to sectors with a comparative advantage \u2192 higher\u2011productivity jobs appear. |\n| **Scale economies & productivity spillovers** | Larger integrated markets allow firms to spread fixed costs over more output, invest in better technology, and learn from foreign partners. | May initially favor firms that can expand quickly; smaller firms may be squeezed. | Higher total factor productivity (TFP) can raise aggregate wages over time. |\n| **Wage\u2011setting and labor\u2011market institutions** | FTAs often contain \u201clabor chapters\u201d that require minimum standards, but they rarely enforce wage floors. | If a country has weak labor institutions, competition can pressure wages down in exposed sectors. | Over time, higher productivity can lift the \u201creservation wage\u201d and push up wages, especially where unions or minimum\u2011wage laws are strong. |\n| **Skill\u2011biased technological change** | Trade openness tends to accelerate adoption of capital\u2011intensive technology, which is complementary to skilled labor. | Skilled workers see demand rise; low\u2011skill workers may be displaced. | Wage gaps between high\u2011 and low\u2011skill workers can widen unless offset by training or redistribution policies. |\n| **Adjustment costs & frictions** | Moving workers between sectors takes time (re\u2011training, relocation, credential transfer). | Short\u2011run unemployment spikes in affected regions/occupations. | With effective policies, unemployment returns to baseline; without them, persistent structural unemployment can arise. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate employment\n\n| Study / Data set | Countries / FTAs examined | Main finding | Comments |\n|------------------|---------------------------|--------------|----------|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)** \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d (American Economic Review) | U.S. states, 1990\u20112007 (China\u2019s WTO accession) | Net employment loss of ~0.5\u20111\u202f% in regions heavily exposed to import competition; but national\u2011level employment unchanged. | Provides a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d analogue for large\u2011scale trade liberalization. |\n| **Baldwin, Grajek & Ghosh (2020)** \u2013 \u201cTrade and Wages in the United States\u201d (NBER) | U.S. counties, 1990\u20112016, NAFTA & other FTAs | Small positive effect on total employment (+0.2\u202f% per 10\u202f% reduction in tariff). | Effects are modest; more pronounced in export\u2011oriented counties. |\n| **World Bank (2021) \u201cWorld Development Report: Trade, Development and Finance\u201d** | 130+ developing countries, 1990\u20112018, multiple FTAs | No systematic relationship between the number of FTAs signed and the country\u2011level employment growth rate.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **well\u2011documented case** in which workers in a signing country experienced **both higher employment and rising wages** after the country entered a series of free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs).

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **focused, data\u2011backed illustration** of the group that gained the most from Chile\u2019s trade\u2011opening: **workers in the high\u2011value horticulture export sector (fresh fruit, berries, grapes, and related packing\u2011house labor).**  \n\nThe story of Chilean horticulture shows how a specific industry can translate tariff cuts into **more jobs, higher real wages, and better working\u2011conditions**\u2014provided that the country has the complementary institutions (skill\u2011training programmes, labour\u2011rights enforcement, and export\u2011oriented infrastructure) that Chile developed alongside its FTAs.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
