How rent control works \u2013 the basic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | Short\u2011run effect | Expected long\u2011run effect |\n|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** on existing leases (e.g., \u201ccap rents at 5\u202f% per year\u201d) | Tenants keep rent lower than market price; landlords receive less revenue per unit. | If the ceiling is **binding** (set below market rent) it reduces the **net return** to landlords, which can change their incentives to *supply* or *maintain* housing. |\n| **Regulation of new construction** (e.g., \u201cnew units are exempt\u201d or \u201cnew units must be offered at market rent\u201d) | New supply is not directly constrained, but developers anticipate future regulation and may build fewer units. | Over time, the **effective housing stock** can grow more slowly, especially where \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d is weak. |\n| **Tenant\u2011protection provisions** (e.g., \u201cjust cause eviction,\u201d \u201cright of first refusal\u201d) | Improves stability for current tenants. | Can increase **turnover costs** and reduce **mobility**, potentially creating a \u201cshadow market\u201d of informal payments or sub\u2011letting. |\n\nTheoretical literature (e.g., *Glaeser & Luttmer, 2003*; *Arnott, 1995*) predicts that a binding rent ceiling reduces the *quantity* of rental housing supplied and the *quality* of existing units, while raising *allocation inefficiencies* (units go to those who happen to be in the right place at the right time). Empirical work tests how strongly these mechanisms appear in real cities.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The legal and financial \u201chook\u201d that makes conversion attractive  \n\n| Element | What the law permits | Why it matters to a landlord |\n|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Exemption from rent\u2011control** | In most U.S. jurisdictions, a building (or a portion of it) can be **exempted** if the owner **converts the rental units to condos, co\u2011ops, or \u201cowner\u2011occupied\u201d units**.  New\u202fYork\u2019s **Housing Maintenance Code \u00a7 27\u20112005** and California\u2019s **Civil Code \u00a7\u202f1954.50** are examples. | Once the unit is no longer a \u201crental,\u201d the rent\u2011control ceiling disappears and the owner can set any price for the sale or for a new lease\u2011\u2011to\u2011owner\u2011occupant. |\n| **Tax incentives** | Many cities allow a **tax abatement** (e.g., New\u202fYork\u2019s 421\u2011a program, Washington,\u202fDC\u2019s \u201cHousing Production Trust Fund\u201d credit) for converting \u201caffordable\u201d rental units into \u201caffordable\u201d condos, or they let the owner **defer property\u2011tax reassessment** for several years. | Improves the return\u2011on\u2011investment (ROI) calculation and shortens the pay\u2011back period for the conversion cost. |\n| **Higher market price per square foot** | In high\u2011density, high\u2011demand neighborhoods, a **condo can sell for 2\u20114\u00d7 the annual rent** that a rent\u2011controlled tenant would have paid. | The landlord can recover the cost of the conversion (architectural, legal, permitting) quickly and then enjoy a **steady cash\u2011flow** from condo\u2011owner fees or from resale. |\n| **Regulatory \u201cwindow\u201d** | Some municipalities run **\u201cincentive\u2011based\u201d rezoning rounds** (e.g., San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s \u201cHousing Element\u201d 2017\u20112021) that speed up approvals for \u201cup\u2011zoning\u201d or \u201cin\u2011place\u201d conversion projects. | Reduces the typical 12\u201124\u2011month permitting delay that would otherwise make the project financially risky. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Purchase price: **US\u202f$45\u202fmillion** (\u2248\u202f$375\u202fk per unit). | No conversion yet; building is subject to NYC\u2019s \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d ceiling (\u2248\u202f5\u202f% increase per year). | Cash\u2011flow: $1,200\u2013$1,500/month per unit \u2192 **\u2248\u202f$2.2\u202fM/year** gross. |\n| **2004\u20112006** | Files **\u201cCertificate of Occupancy\u201d (CO) amendment** to change the building from \u201cmultiple\u2011family rental\u201d to \u201ccondominium.\u201d The application cites a \u201csubstantial rehabilitation\u201d plan (new windows, elevator, lobby). | NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) grants the CO amendment **April\u202f2006** after a 14\u2011month review (no community board objection recorded). | Conversion cost: **$12\u202fmillion** (architectural design, new elevator, lobby, legal fees). |\n| **2007\u20112009** | **Renovates** interior (adds 2 additional floors within the existing envelope, modern finishes). | Receives **421\u2011a tax credit** for 10\u202f% of the construction cost because 20\u202f% of the condos are set aside for \u201cmoderately\u2011affordable\u201d buyers (income \u2264\u202f120\u202f% of area median). | Total capital outlay: **$27\u202fmillion** (including purchase, conversion, renovation). |\n| **2010** | **Sells 100 condos** (average size 800\u202fsq\u202fft).
