      "unknown_model_response": "**Red meat and cancer \u2013 what the evidence actually says**\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the scientific literature as of early\u202f2024.  It is organized by the type of evidence, the cancers that have been studied most intensively, the biological mechanisms that have been proposed, and the limits of what we can (and cannot) conclude from the data.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the research is structured  \n\n| Evidence type | What it can tell us | Typical strengths | Typical weaknesses |\n|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **International agency assessments** (e.g., IARC, WHO, USDA) | Systematic reviews of all published studies; assign a *hazard classification* (evidence for *causality*). | Broad, transparent, use pre\u2011defined criteria. | Dependent on quality of underlying studies; classifications are about *hazard* (possibility of causing disease), not *risk* (how big the effect is in a real diet). |\n| **Prospective cohort studies** (e.g., EPIC, NHS, HPFS, US\u202fNIH\u2011AARP) | Track large numbers of people over years, relate baseline diet to later cancer incidence. | Large sample sizes, ability to adjust for many confounders, temporal direction (diet \u2192 disease). | Observational only \u2013 cannot prove causation; measurement error in diet questionnaires; residual confounding (e.g., lifestyle, genetics). |\n| **Case\u2011control studies** | Compare past diet of people with cancer (cases) to similar people without cancer (controls). | Efficient for rare cancers; can collect detailed dietary data. | Recall bias (cases may remember diet differently); selection bias. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses & pooled analyses** | Combine results from many studies to increase statistical power and examine dose\u2011response. | More precise estimates; can test heterogeneity across populations. | Quality depends on included studies; publication bias can inflate effects. |\n| **Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)** (very few) | Randomly assign participants to different diets or meat\u2011substitution interventions. | Gold\u2011standard for causality. | Short duration, small sample size, ethical limits on long\u2011term cancer outcomes; most RCTs focus on intermediate biomarkers (e.g., colonocyte DNA damage) rather than cancer itself. |\n| **Mechanistic/experimental studies** (cell culture, animal models) | Test biological pathways (e.g., formation of carcinogenic compounds). | Provide plausible *biological* explanations. | May not translate directly to human diet levels. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Unprocessed red meat was classified as **\u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d** (Group\u202f2A) in the 2022 *Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans* (based on new evidence linking it to colorectal cancer). | *\u201cCarcinogenic to humans\u201d* (Group\u202f1). | No specific intake limit; risk is described as *dose\u2011dependent* (\u22480.5\u202f% increase in colorectal cancer risk per 50\u202fg of processed meat per day). |\n| **World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) \u2013 2020 report** | *\u201cLimited evidence\u201d* that high intake of unprocessed red meat increases colorectal cancer risk; *\u201cconvincing evidence\u201d* for processed meat. | *\u201cConvincing evidence\u201d* of increased risk for colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. | Recommend \u2264\u202f500\u202fg cooked weight of unprocessed red meat per week; avoid processed meat. |\n| **US Dietary Guidelines (2020\u20112025)** | Suggest \u201c",
