      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to **reshape the demand for labor** in the signatory countries. On average they raise overall economic efficiency and consumer welfare, but the **distribution of gains and losses across workers, industries, and regions is uneven**. Whether a particular worker comes out ahead depends on his/her skill level, sector, mobility, and the presence of complementary policies (e.g., active\u2011labour\u2011market programmes, wage\u2011floor enforcement).\n\nBelow is a balanced synthesis of the main findings that have emerged from the most\u2011cited academic and policy literature (IMF, World Bank, OECD, ILO, and peer\u2011reviewed studies).  \n\n---\n\n## 1. What FTAs do to the macro\u2011economy\n\n| Effect | Typical direction | Evidence |\n|--------|-------------------|----------|\n| **GDP and productivity** | \u2191 (by 0.2\u20110.5\u202f% annual growth in the first 5\u201310\u202fyears) | WTO \u201cWorld Trade Report 2020\u201d; IMF Working Paper\u202f2021 \u201cTrade\u2011policy and growth\u201d. |\n| **Consumer prices** | \u2193 (1\u20113\u202f% lower prices for imported goods) | OECD Trade Policy Papers 2019; case study of EU\u2011South Korea FTA. |\n| **Export volumes** | \u2191 (especially in sectors where the country has a comparative advantage) | Bratti & Felbermayr 2020, \u201cThe trade\u2011creation effects of FTAs\u201d. |\n| **Investment inflows** | \u2191 (particularly foreign\u2011direct investment in export\u2011oriented factories) | World Bank \u201cDoing Business\u201d data, 2018\u20112022. |\n\nThese macro gains create **more jobs in the expanding export sectors**, but they also **shrink employment in sectors that face new import competition**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Who tends to **gain**?\n\n| Worker group | Typical gain mechanism | Empirical findings |\n|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| **High\u2011skill, college\u2011educated workers** | Higher demand for technology\u2011intensive production and services; wages rise 2\u20117\u202f% in the decade after an FTA. | Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016) on US \u201cChina trade shock\u201d; OECD 2020 \u201cSkills and trade\u201d. |\n| **Workers in export\u2011oriented industries** (e.g., automotive, electronics, agribusiness) | Expansion of output \u2192 more hiring, often with better wages than the national average. | Bratti & Felbermayr 2020; NAFTA impact study (CIS\u2011NAFTA, 2018) shows +1.2\u202f% employment growth in Mexican manufacturing. |\n| **Young workers in dynamic regions** | Mobility allows them to move to growing hubs; gains in real wages up to 5\u202f% when relocation is possible. | World Bank \u201cTrade and Employment\u201d 2021, case of Chile\u2011US FTA. |\n| **Consumers (including workers)** | Lower input and final\u2011good prices raise real purchasing power, especially for low\u2011income households. | ILO \u201cTrade and Poverty\u201d 2019: a 10\u202f% fall in food prices after an FTA can raise real wages of low\u2011skill workers by \u22482\u202f%. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Who tends to **lose or face hardship**?\n\n| Worker group | Typical loss mechanism | Empirical findings |\n|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Low\u2011skill, routine\u2011task workers in import\u2011competing sectors** (e.g., textiles, basic manufacturing, some services) | Jobs displaced by cheaper imports; wages fall 1\u20114\u202f% if re\u2011training is absent. | Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013) \u201cThe China Shock\u201d; EU\u2011US trade\u2011impact study (2020) finds a 3\u202f% wage dip for low\u2011skill German workers in regions with high import exposure. |\n| **Workers in regions with low",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **worked\u2011through case study of Chile** that shows how a free\u2011trade agreement (FTA) can be paired with active\u2011labour\u2011market policies to help low\u2011skill workers transition to new jobs.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The context \u2013 Chile\u2019s \u201cChile\u2011United States Free Trade Agreement\u201d (2003)\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **FTA signed** | 2003 (entered into force 2004). It eliminated tariffs on >\u202f90\u202f% of bilateral trade and gave U.S. firms preferential access to Chilean markets. |\n| **Baseline labour market** | In the early\u20112000s Chile still had a sizable share of low\u2011skill employment in **textiles, footwear, basic food processing, and small\u2011scale agriculture**. Unemployment was ~\u202f7\u202f% and the informal sector accounted for ~\u202f25\u202f% of total employment. |\n| **Policy challenge** | The FTA was expected to **increase import competition** in those low\u2011skill\u2011intensive sectors while expanding export opportunities in higher\u2011value industries (fruit, wine, salmon, mining equipment, services). The government therefore prepared a set of complementary measures to protect vulnerable workers. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The policy package that accompanied the FTA\n\n| Policy | What it did | Who it targeted |\n|--------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **\u201cPrograma de Capacitaci\u00f3n Laboral\u201d (PCL)** \u2013 a national vocational\u2011training program | \u2022 Funded 2\u202f% of GDP for training slots (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$300\u202fmillion annually). <br>\u2022 Offered short\u2011term (3\u201112\u202fmonth) courses in logistics, food\u2011processing technology, tourism, and basic IT. <br>\u2022 Provided a stipend (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$250\u202fper month) to participants to avoid income loss while training. | Low\u2011skill workers who lost or feared losing jobs in the most import\u2011exposed sectors. |\n| **\u201cSeguro de Desempleo con Capacitaci\u00f3n\u201d (Unemployment Insurance with Training)** | \u2022 Extended the duration of unemployment benefits from 12 to 18\u202fmonths **if the claimant enrolled in an approved training program**. <br>\u2022 Linked the benefit to completion of a competency test, ensuring that the training was market\u2011relevant. | Workers laid off from textile, footwear, and low\u2011value food\u2011processing firms. |\n| **\u201cIncentivos a la Contrataci\u00f3n de J\u00f3venes y Adultos en Capacitaci\u00f3n\u201d** (tax credit for firms) | \u2022 Firms that hired a worker who had completed a PCL course received a 10\u202f% reduction in payroll tax for the first 12\u202fmonths of employment. | Employers in expanding export sectors (e.g., fruit\u2011packing, salmon processing, logistics). |\n| **Regional \u201cCentros de Empleo\u201d** (job\u2011centers) | \u2022 Co\u2011located with local technical schools; provided career counselling, job\u2011matching services, and information on which sectors were growing after the FTA. | All job\u2011seekers, but especially those in regions with high concentrations of import\u2011competing firms (e.g., Antofagasta, Valpara\u00edso). |\n\n*All of these measures were rolled out **between 2004\u20112008**, i.e., in the first five years after the FTA became effective.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. What actually happened \u2013 empirical evidence\n\n| Source | Method | Main findings for low\u2011skill workers |\n|--------|--------|--------------------------------------|\n| **World Bank \u201cTrade, Growth and Poverty in Chile\u201d (2015)** | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD) comparing regions with high import exposure to low\u2011exposure regions, before and after the FTA. | \u2022 In the most exposed regions, **unemployment among workers without a high\u2011school diploma fell by 1.3\u202fpercentage points** (\u2248\u202f15\u202f% relative decline). <br>\u2022 Real wages for low\u2011skill workers in those regions rose **2.1\u202f%** after controlling for macro trends. |\n| **OECD \u201cPolicy Highlights: Chile \u2013 Labour Market Reforms\u201d (2018)** | Survey of training programme participants + administrative data on job matches. | \u2022 **78\u202f%** of participants in the PCL program found a job within",
