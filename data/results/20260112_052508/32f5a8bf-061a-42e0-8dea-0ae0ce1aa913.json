      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) in a nutshell**\n\n| What it is | How it works | Why central banks use it |\n|------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| A large\u2011scale purchase of financial assets (normally government bonds, sometimes mortgage\u2011backed securities or corporate bonds) financed by creating new reserves at the central bank. | 1. **Asset\u2011price channel** \u2013 buying bonds pushes up their price and pushes down yields, which lowers borrowing costs for households and firms. <br>2. **Portfolio\u2011balance channel** \u2013 investors shift out of the now\u2011cheaper safe assets into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate), raising those prices. <br>3. **Expectations / forward\u2011guidance channel** \u2013 the policy signals that rates will stay low for a long time, shaping spending and investment decisions. <br>4. **Exchange\u2011rate channel** \u2013 lower yields can depreciate the domestic currency, boosting net exports. | To stimulate aggregate demand when short\u2011term policy rates are already at or near the zero lower bound (e.g., after a recession or a financial crisis). The goal is to lift output and employment while keeping inflation near the target. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main distributional pathways\n\n| Pathway | Who tends to **gain** | Who tends to **lose** (or face higher risk) | Key empirical evidence |\n|---------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Lower borrowing costs** (mortgages, auto loans, business credit) | Home\u2011buyers (especially those who can qualify for a mortgage), small\u2011business owners, consumers who can refinance debt | Households that are **under\u2011banked** or have poor credit scores (often low\u2011income) may not benefit because they cannot obtain the cheaper credit. | The Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cReport on the Economic Well\u2011Being of U.S. Households\u201d (2022) shows a 30\u202f% rise in mortgage\u2011refi activity after QE3, concentrated among borrowers with credit scores >\u202f720. |\n| **Higher asset prices** (stocks, corporate bonds, REITs, housing) | Existing owners of financial assets \u2013 typically higher\u2011income households, pension funds, corporations, and the very wealthy. | People who rely on wages and have little or no financial assets \u2013 low\u2011income renters, retirees on fixed income. | Studies by \u202fBorio & Zabai (2020) and by the International Monetary Fund (IMF, 2021) estimate that the U.S. wealth gap widened by 1\u20132\u202fpercentage points of total wealth per year of QE, driven largely by rising equity and housing prices. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect on consumption** (higher perceived wealth \u2192 higher spending) | Households that see their portfolio values rise; this includes middle\u2011class families that own a home or a modest stock portfolio. | Households whose wealth is unchanged (e.g., renters) may feel relatively poorer and cut back. | Carney (2020) finds that a 10\u202f% rise in housing prices after QE increased consumption by about 0.5\u202f% of GDP, but the effect was concentrated in the top quintile of wealth holders. |\n| **Inflation expectations** (future price rises) | Borrowers with fixed\u2011rate debt (the real value of what they repay falls). | Savers and those on fixed incomes (e.g., Social Security recipients) because the purchasing power of cash balances erodes. | In the Euro\u2011area, the ECB\u2019s \u201cSurvey of Professional Forecasters\u201d (2023) shows that after QE, inflation expectations rose modestly (\u22480.4\u202fppt) and were felt most by households with high cash holdings. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate depreciation** (cheaper imports become more expensive, exports cheaper) | Export\u2011oriented firms and workers in those sectors (often higher\u2011skill, better\u2011paid jobs). | Consumers of imported goods (especially low\u2011income households that spend",

Food, gasoline and health\u2011care prices rise, wiping out about **$1,200** of the extra cash. <br>\u2022 **Renters\u2019 market**: The average rent for a comparable 3\u2011bedroom unit in their suburb jumps from $1,350 to $1,550 per month (+15\u202f%). Their teenage daughter\u2019s friend\u2019s family, who rent, now has to spend **$2,400 more per year** on housing. <br>\u2022 **Savings rate**: Because of the lower mortgage payment, the Garcias can increase their emergency\u2011fund savings from $8\u202fk to $11\u202fk (\u2248$250 extra per month).<br>\u2022 **Retirement outlook**: The higher 401(k) balance (thanks to market gains) means their projected retirement income rises by about $1,500 per year at age\u202f65. |\n\n\n### 1. **How the benefits show up**\n\n| Benefit | Mechanism | What the Garcias \u201cfeel\u201d |\n|--------|-----------|------------------------|\n| **Cheaper mortgage** | QE pushes long\u2011term Treasury yields down; banks pass the lower cost onto borrowers who refinance. | Their monthly housing out\u2011flow drops by $139 \u2192 more disposable income, ability to pay down debt faster or boost savings. |\n| **Rising home equity** | Portfolio\u2011balance channel: investors shift into riskier assets (including REITs), pushing up housing prices. | Their net\u2011worth jumps by $35\u202fk on paper.

But **profit\u2011sharing, bonuses, and stock\u2011based compensation** tend to be concentrated among higher\u2011skill workers.
