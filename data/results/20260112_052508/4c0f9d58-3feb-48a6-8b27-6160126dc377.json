      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.\u202fWhat sanctions are meant to do  \n\n| **Goal** | **How it is supposed to work** | **Typical tools** |\n|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Coerce a change in policy or behavior** (e.g., stop a nuclear program, end aggression) | By raising the *cost* of the target\u2019s actions and/or lowering the *benefits* of continuing them. The idea is that the target will calculate that the pain from the sanction outweighs the political or strategic value of the behavior. | Trade bans, asset freezes, financial\u2011market restrictions, travel bans, sector\u2011specific embargoes (oil, arms, technology). |\n| **Signal disapproval / isolate diplomatically** | Create a reputational penalty that makes other states reluctant to cooperate with the target, thereby increasing its \u201cpolitical cost.\u201d | Diplomatic expulsions, exclusion from international organisations, public naming. |\n| **Punish a regime while limiting humanitarian harm** (the \u201csmart\u201d or *targeted* sanctions approach) | By focusing on elites, military, or specific sectors rather than the whole population, the hope is to pressure decision\u2011makers without causing mass suffering. | Asset freezes on officials, visa bans, restrictions on specific companies or banks. |\n| **Raise the domestic political cost of the target\u2019s policy** | Domestic audiences see the sanctions as a tangible loss, which can weaken the regime\u2019s internal support for the contested policy. | Broad economic sanctions that cause inflation, unemployment, or shortages. |\n\nThe underlying economic logic is simple: **reduce the target\u2019s welfare** (through reduced export revenues, higher borrowing costs, limited access to inputs, etc.) **or raise the opportunity cost of the undesired action** (e.g., continuing a war while the economy collapses).  \n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHow scholars measure \u201csuccess\u201d\n\n| **Metric** | **What it captures** | **Strengths / Weaknesses** |\n|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Policy change** (e.g., denuclearisation, cease\u2011fire) | Direct, binary outcome that matches the sanction\u2019s stated objective. | Easy to code, but causality is hard to isolate; many other diplomatic moves occur simultaneously. |\n| **Compliance without full policy reversal** (e.g., partial arms\u2011control agreements) | Recognises incremental gains. | Subjective \u2013 what counts as \u201cenough\u201d compliance? |\n| **Regime change** (toppling or weakening of leadership) | Often the *implicit* goal of sanctions, especially when the target is authoritarian. | Rarely the official rationale; conflates sanctions with internal unrest, foreign intervention, or economic crises. |\n| **Economic impact on target** (GDP contraction, inflation, trade volume) | Objective data, readily available. | Economic pain does not automatically translate into political pressure; elite \u201crent\u2011seeking\u201d can insulate leaders. |\n| **Humanitarian outcomes** (mortality, malnutrition, health\u2011system collapse) | Important for ethical assessment. | Hard to attribute solely to sanctions; conflict, natural disasters, and pre\u2011existing poverty also contribute. |\n\nBecause there is no single universally\u2011accepted definition of \u201csuccess,\u201d meta\u2011studies often adopt a **binary coding** (success/failure) based on the *stated* objective of the sanction\u2011imposing coalition, then test statistical relationships with design variables (unilateral vs multilateral, comprehensive vs targeted, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fWhat the empirical literature says  \n\n### 3.1\u202fBroad quantitative syntheses  \n\n| Study (year) | Sample & Method | Main finding | Caveats |\n|--------------|----------------|--------------|---------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* (2007, 2nd ed. 2020)** | 221 cases (1945\u20112005), logistic regression of \u201cpolicy change\u201d vs. sanction characteristics. | **\u2248 34\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their explicit political aim; multilateral sanctions were **~2.5\u00d7** more likely to succeed than unilateral ones; targeted sanctions were **slightly less** effective than comprehensive trade embargoes. | Coding of \u201csuccess\u201d is coarse; many cases involve simultaneous diplomatic negotiations, making causal attribution ambiguous. |\n| **Kaempfer & Lowenberg \u2013 *Sanctions and the Target\u2019s Economy*",

A \u201csuccessful\u201d sanction: The end of South\u2011Africa\u2019s apartheid (late 1980s\u2011early 1990s)\n\n| **Element** | **Details** |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| **Sanction design** | \u2022 **Multilateral** \u2013 United Nations Security Council Resolution\u202f418 (1977) imposed a mandatory arms embargo; the UN also adopted resolutions calling for a comprehensive **trade and investment boycott**. <br>\u2022 **Broad coalition** \u2013 Over 80\u201190\u202f% of world trade (U.S., EU, Japan, Canada, many African and Latin\u2011American states) participated. <br>\u2022 **Both comprehensive and targeted** \u2013 General bans on oil, coal, steel, aircraft, and also **targeted measures** such as asset freezes on senior apartheid\u2011government officials and travel bans. |\n| **Stated political objective** | Force the National Party government to **dismantle institutionalised racial segregation** and negotiate a transition to majority rule. |\n| **Outcome** | By 1990 the South\u2011African government announced the **unbanning of anti\u2011apartheid political organisations**, the **release of Nelson Mandela**, and the start of negotiations that led to the **1994 democratic elections**. The United Nations formally lifted the sanctions in 1994. |\n| **Why it worked (according to the literature)** | 1. **Economic pressure on the elite** \u2013 Sanctions hit the **gold\u2011mining, mining, and oil sectors**, which were the main revenue streams for the apartheid regime and for the personal fortunes of its top officials. The loss of foreign capital and technology made the ruling elite increasingly dependent on the government for their own wealth, giving them a strong incentive to change policy. <br>2. **International isolation** \u2013 Apartheid South Africa went from being a **major regional trading hub** to a pariah state. The diplomatic cost (loss of legitimacy, exclusion from Commonwealth, UN condemnation) amplified the economic pain. <br>3. **Broad multilateral participation** \u2013 Because the embargo was almost universal, the regime could not simply reroute trade through a single sympathetic partner. The \u201cnetwork effect\u201d (multiple sanctioning states simultaneously cutting off different sectors) raised the **overall cost** beyond what a unilateral embargo could have achieved. <br>4. **Domestic political leverage** \u2013 The sanctions amplified internal dissent (mass protests, labor strikes). The government could no longer claim that external pressure was a *foreign* ploy; the sanctions were felt as a **home\u2011grown crisis** that the ruling party could not ignore. <br>5. **Clear, limited objective** \u2013 The demand was concrete (\u201cend apartheid\u201d). This gave negotiators a **single, observable metric** of success, making it easier to judge when the target had complied. |\n| **Key scholarly citations** | \u2022 Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f(2007, 2020) \u2013 treat the case as a textbook example of a *multilateral, comprehensive* sanction that achieved its political goal. <br>\u2022 Kaempfer\u202f(1998) \u2013 notes that the **elite\u2011targeting** component (asset freezes, travel bans) was crucial in \u201cbringing the regime to the negotiating table.\u201d <br>\u2022 Bantekas & Wessel\u202f(2006) \u2013 show that **sanction depth** (percentage of total trade cut) exceeded 50\u202f% for South Africa, a level rarely reached in failed cases. |\n\n---\n\n## B.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a second, **high\u2011profile \u201cfailure\u201d** that scholars cite repeatedly: the **U.S.\u2013led embargo on Cuba** that began in 1960 and was only partially lifted in 2014\u20112022.  \n\nThe case is useful because it illustrates several *classic reasons* why sanctions often **do not** achieve their political aim, even when they are long\u2011lasting, comprehensive, and well\u2011intentioned.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The Cuban embargo \u2013 a concise case file  \n\n| **Aspect** | **What happened** |\n|------------|-------------------|\n| **Sanctioning actor(s)** | **Unilateral** \u2013 The United States imposed the embargo (initially a **partial trade ban** in 1960, expanded to a **near\u2011total embargo** in 1962). A handful of allies (e.g., Spain, Canada, most EU members) **did not** join; the UN General Assembly passed **annual resolutions calling for the embargo\u2019s end**, but these were non\u2011binding. |\n| **Scope & tools** | \u2022 **Comprehensive trade ban** on almost all Cuban imports and exports (except food, medicine, and a few humanitarian items). <br>\u2022 **Financial restrictions** \u2013 prohibition on U.S. banks dealing with Cuban banks; secondary sanctions on non\u2011U.S. firms that facilitated prohibited transactions. <br>\u2022 **Travel restrictions** \u2013 U.S. citizens barred from tourism trips; limited academic\u2011exchange visas. <br>\u2022 **Asset freezes** on Cuban government entities and individuals. |\n| **Stated political objective** | **Force the Cuban government (the Communist Party and Fidel\u202fCastro\u2019s regime) to abandon its Marxist\u2011Leninist system, release political prisoners, and hold free elections** \u2013 i.e., a regime\u2011change or democratisation agenda. |\n| **Observed outcome (2024)** | \u2022 **Regime survived** \u2013 The Communist Party remains in power; the political system has not become pluralist. <br>\u2022 **Economic impact** \u2013 Cuban GDP has been chronically depressed, but the **largest shock** came from the **U.S. \u201ctropical storm\u201d of 1991 (the \u201cSpecial Period\u201d)** after the Soviet Union collapsed, not the embargo itself. <br>\u2022 **Humanitarian costs** \u2013 Shortages of medicines, equipment, and food have been documented, though the U.S. claims humanitarian exemptions. <br>\u2022 **Limited political liberalisation** \u2013 Small reforms (e.g., limited private\u2011sector activity, internet expansion) have occurred, but they are **state\u2011driven**, not a response to the embargo. |\n| **Bottom\u2011line assessment** | **Failure** \u2013 The embargo did **not** achieve its core political goal of regime change or democratic transition, even after more than six decades. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Why the embargo failed \u2013 the \u201cmechanisms\u201d that broke down  \n\n| **Failure factor** | **Explanation & evidence** |\n|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| **1.\u202fUnilateral vs. multilateral enforcement** | *The sanctions lacked broad international participation.*  Over 180 UN member states repeatedly voted to **end** the embargo, and many (EU, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, etc.) continued **normal trade** with Cuba.  The United States therefore could not cut off *all* external sources of goods, finance, or technology.  Studies (e.g., **Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal., 2007**) show that **multilateral sanctions are \u22482.5\u202f\u00d7 more likely to succeed** than unilateral ones. |\n| **2.\u202fTarget\u2019s \u201cstrategic depth\u201d and alternative partners** | Cuba maintained **substantial economic ties with the Soviet Union (until 1991)**, and later with **Venezuela, China, Russia, and the EU**.  These partners supplied **oil, food, credit, and technical assistance** that mitigated the U.S. embargo\u2019s impact.  The presence of **\u201csanction\u2011busting\u201d networks** (e.g., ship\u2011to\u2011ship transfers, cash\u2011in\u2011hand payments) kept critical imports flowing. |\n| **3.\u202fDomestic political insulation of the elite** | The Cuban leadership **controlled the distribution of scarce resources** (e.g., ration cards, housing, employment).
