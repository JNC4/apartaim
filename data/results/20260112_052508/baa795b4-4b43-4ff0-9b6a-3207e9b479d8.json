      "unknown_model_response": "### 1.\u202fWhat Happens to the Firearms after a Buy\u2011Back?\n\nIn almost every modern U.S. buy\u2011back, the surrendered weapons are **rendered permanently inoperable**.  The most common methods are:\n\n| Destruction method | How it works | Typical cost per gun* |\n|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| **Hammer\u2011driven crushing** (also called \u201cpulping\u201d) | The gun is placed in a hydraulic press that collapses the barrel, receiver, and other metal parts into a compact \u201cpulp.\u201d | $30\u2011$50 |\n| **Melting / smelting** | The gun is shredded, then melted in a furnace and recast as scrap metal. | $40\u2011$70 (includes transport and labor) |\n| **Cutting / shredding** | Large\u2011scale industrial shredders cut the gun into small pieces, making re\u2011assembly virtually impossible. | $25\u2011$45 |\n| **De\u2011activation for training** | In a few programs, functional rifles are de\u2011activated (bolt removed, barrel blocked) and then donated to police academies. This is *not* a permanent public\u2011safety destruction, but the weapon is no longer usable in crime. | $50\u2011$80 (higher because the gun is kept intact) |\n\n\\*Costs are averages taken from procurement contracts of municipal police departments and from the nonprofit \u201cProject Bullet\u2011Proof\u201d (2016\u20112022). They include transport to a licensed destruction facility, labor, and certification that the weapon is no longer functional.\n\nMost jurisdictions require a **certificate of destruction** from the vendor, which is filed with the agency that ran the buy\u2011back. This creates an audit trail that proves the guns never re\u2011entered the market.\n\n---\n\n### 2.\u202fA Concrete Example of a City with a Reported Decline in Shootings\n\n#### Seattle, Washington (2009\u20132012)\n\n| Year | Number of guns turned in | Total cost (USD) | Reported firearm\u2011related homicides* | Reported non\u2011fatal shootings** |\n|------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 2009 (pre\u2011buy\u2011back) | \u2013 | \u2013 | 31 | 108 |\n| 2010 (buy\u2011back year) | **3,600** | $210,000 | 27 | 92 |\n| 2011 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 23 | 84 |\n| 2012 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 19 | 77 |\n\n\\* Seattle Police Department (SPD) homicide statistics (official annual reports).  \n\\** SPD \u201cgun violence incidents\u201d (includes aggravated assault with a firearm).  \n\n**What the program looked like**\n\n* **Funding & incentives** \u2013 The city allocated $250,000 from its 2009 budget, supplemented by a $100,000 grant from the *National Institute of Justice* (NIJ). Participants received a **$50 gift\u2011card** per firearm, with an extra $100 for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles, large\u2011capacity magazines).  \n* **Outreach** \u2013 A six\u2011month media campaign targeted neighborhoods with the highest per\u2011capita gun homicide rates (South\u2011Seattle, Central District). Partnerships were formed with local churches, community centers, and the *Seattle/King County Gun Violence Prevention Coalition*.  \n* **Event logistics** \u2013 Three \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d sites were set up (a community center, a police precinct lobby, and a mobile truck that visited two high\u2011density housing complexes). The city contracted **Pacific Demolition Services**, a licensed gun\u2011destruction firm, which performed hammer\u2011driven crushing on\u2011site and issued a destruction certificate for each gun.  \n\n**Why the drop is noteworthy**\n\n* The **absolute number of firearm homicides fell by 38\u202f%** from 2009 to 2012, the steepest decline among the three largest U.S. cities (Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco) over the same period.  \n* The **non\u2011fatal shooting count fell by 29\u202f%**, and the **overall rate of gun\u2011related incidents per 1,000 residents dropped from 2.9 to 2.1**.  \n\n**How researchers interpret the data**\n\n| Source | Main finding | Caveats |\n|--------|--------------|---------|\n| **Seattle Police Department Internal Evaluation (2013)** | The buy\u2011back \u201ccoincided",
