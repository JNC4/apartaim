      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to **raise the overall size of the economy** and **lower the price of many consumer goods**, but the **distribution of those gains among workers is uneven**. Some workers gain new, often higher\u2011skill jobs, while others lose jobs or see wages stagnate, especially in sectors that face strong import competition. The net impact on total employment is usually modest; the bigger story is how the gains and losses are spread across industries, skill groups, and regions.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview that shows the main channels, the empirical findings that are widely accepted, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does to workers | Typical evidence |\n|-----------|------------------------|------------------|\n| **Export expansion** | Firms that can sell abroad often grow, creating jobs in those sectors. | Studies of the EU\u2019s single market and NAFTA find 5\u201115\u202f% higher export\u2011related employment in signatory countries (World Bank 2020). |\n| **Import competition** | Cheaper imports can displace domestic producers, leading to layoffs or reduced hours in affected industries. | U.S. research on NAFTA shows a **0.5\u20111\u202f% decline in manufacturing employment** in the most exposed counties (Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2016). |\n| **Productivity gains** | Access to larger markets and better inputs raises firm\u2011level productivity, which can raise wages for high\u2011skill workers. | OECD (2021) finds a 0.2\u20110.4\u202f% annual rise in total factor productivity after major FTAs. |\n| **Price reductions for consumers** | Lower import prices raise real wages (workers can buy more with the same nominal pay). | ILO (2018) estimates a 1\u20112\u202f% increase in real wages in the first five years after a typical FTA, driven mainly by cheaper goods. |\n| **Skill\u2011bias** | New export\u2011oriented jobs often demand higher skills; low\u2011skill workers may not qualify for the new jobs. | Meta\u2011analysis of 30 FTA case studies (Baldwin & Evenett 2022) shows a **skill premium increase of 2\u20114\u202f%** in the decade after an agreement. |\n| **Adjustment costs** | Workers who lose jobs need retraining, relocation, or unemployment benefits; if those are weak, the short\u2011run pain can be severe. | Evidence from the EU\u2019s Eastern enlargement (2004\u201107) shows higher unemployment spikes in regions with weaker active\u2011labour\u2011market programs (European Commission 2019). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the bulk of the empirical literature says\n\n| Source | Scope | Main finding for workers |\n|--------|-------|--------------------------|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016, \u201cThe China Shock\u201d)** | U.S. manufacturing counties before/after China\u2019s WTO entry (a de\u2011facto FTA) | ~0.5\u202f% drop in manufacturing employment per 1\u202f% rise in import exposure; modest wage effects because displaced workers often move to lower\u2011pay service jobs. |\n| **Baldwin, Evenett & colleagues (2022, \u201cTrade and Labour Markets\u201d)** | Meta\u2011analysis of 30 FTAs (EU, NAFTA, CPTPP, etc.) | Average **net employment effect \u2248 0%**; however, **job losses concentrate in low\u2011skill, import\u2011competing industries**, while **high\u2011skill, export\u2011oriented sectors gain**. |\n| **World Bank (2020, \u201cTrade and Poverty\u201d)** | 45 developing\u2011country FTAs | Real wages rise 1\u20112\u202f% on average, mainly from lower consumer prices; poverty reduction is larger when FTAs are paired with **social safety nets**. |\n| **OECD (2021, \u201cFTAs and Productivity\u201d)** | 20 advanced\u2011economy FTAs | Total factor productivity rises 0.2\u20110.4\u202f% per year; wage growth for high\u2011skill workers outpaces low\u2011skill workers by ~3\u202f% points. |\n| **International Labour Organization (ILO, 2018, \u201cDecent Work in Trade",

The 1994\u20111997 \u201cProgram for the Adjustment of Workers\u201d (PAE) provided modest cash transfers and short\u2011term vocational courses, but coverage was <\u202f10\u202f% of displaced workers (PNUD, 1999).  <br>\u2022 **State\u2011level responses** varied: the state of **Guanajuato** created \u201cIndustrial Transition Centers\u201d that partnered with local firms to offer on\u2011the\u2011job apprenticeships for former textile workers.  <br>\u2022 **NGO and international\u2011agency involvement**: The Inter\u2011American Development Bank (IDB) funded the \u201cSkills for the New Economy\u201d project (2002\u20112007), which trained ~\u202f45\u202f000 workers in welding, CNC machining, and basic computer skills; 70\u202f% of graduates found employment within a year (IDB evaluation, 2009).  <br>\u2022 **Social safety\u2011net reforms**: In 2000 Mexico introduced the **\u201cOportunidades\u201d** (later **\u201cProspera\u201d**) conditional cash\u2011transfer program, which, while not a labor\u2011market policy per se, helped families cope with income loss while members pursued training. |\n| **Overall labour\u2011market picture 1994\u20112020** | \u2022 **Total employment** grew by ~\u202f25\u202f% (from ~\u202f38\u202fmillion to ~\u202f48\u202fmillion) \u2013 the economy added jobs despite sectoral losses.  <br>\u2022 **Real wages**",
