Some programs exclude firearms that are prohibited by law (e.g., assault\u2011style weapons, firearms with serial\u2011number removal). | Some jurisdictions accept only **unregistered** or **unlicensed** guns, others accept **all** legal firearms regardless of registration status. |\n| **How the exchange works** | Participants turn in a firearm at a designated site (police station, community center, mobile van). In return they receive a cash voucher, gift card, or other incentive (often $50\u2013$200 per gun). | Incentives may be tiered (higher payment for \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d magazines, assault\u2011style weapons). Some programs offer non\u2011cash rewards (e.g., vouchers for groceries, public\u2011transport passes). |\n| **Verification & record\u2011keeping** | The gun is logged, photographed, and then destroyed (usually by crushing, melting, or shredding). The transaction is recorded to avoid double\u2011counting. | Some programs keep the firearm for forensic analysis; a few allow owners to retain a \u201creceipt\u201d proving they surrendered the gun (useful for liability). |\n| **Public\u2011outreach component** | Advertising through local media, schools, churches, social\u2011media, and door\u2011to\u2011door flyers. Often paired with education about safe storage, conflict\u2011resolution, or mental\u2011health resources. | Some events are \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d at festivals or sports games to increase visibility; others are targeted to high\u2011risk neighborhoods. |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events (often annual) or a series of events over a few weeks/months. | Ongoing \u201cpermanent\u201d drop\u2011boxes, or \u201crolling\u201d buy\u2011backs where a mobile unit visits neighborhoods on a set schedule. |\n\n### Key practical points\n\n* **Legal ownership is retained** \u2013 participants do **not** lose their right to own guns; they simply surrender the specific weapons they bring.  \n* **No\u2011questions\u2011asked policy** \u2013 most programs guarantee anonymity (no police interrogation, no criminal\u2011record check) to encourage participation.  \n* **Destruction** \u2013 after the gun is logged, it is rendered inoperable.
