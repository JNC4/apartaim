What pasteurisation actually does  \n\n| Process | Typical parameters (U.S./EU standards) | Primary purpose |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Traditional \u201cbatch\u201d method |\n| **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (most commercial milk) | Modern continuous flow; kills >99.999\u202f% of *C.\u202fperfringens* spores |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2011150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20115\u202fs (used for long\u2011life milk) | Extends shelf\u2011life to months; destroys almost all microorganisms, including most spores |\n\nThe heat denatures proteins that viruses and bacteria need to infect cells, and it ruptures bacterial cell walls. The process is carefully calibrated so that **the vast majority of pathogenic microbes are eliminated**, while the bulk of the milk\u2019s macro\u2011nutrients (protein, calcium, lactose) remain intact.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1. A recent, well\u2011documented raw\u2011milk outbreak  \n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Year & location** | **2023 \u2013 Washington State, USA** (Pacific Northwest) |\n| **Pathogen** | *Salmonella*\u202fEnteritidis (serotype\u202fEnteritidis) |\n| **Number of people affected** | 21 confirmed cases (13 laboratory\u2011confirmed, 8 probable) |\n| **Severity** | 4 hospitalisations, no deaths |\n| **Source of the milk** | A **small\u2011scale \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d farm** that sold raw milk directly to members of a local \u201cshare\u2011the\u2011cow\u201d cooperative. The farm was located in a rural county \u2248\u202f30\u202fmi from the city where most cases lived. |\n| **How investigators linked the illness to the milk** | 1. **Case\u2011finding & interview** \u2013 State health officials interviewed each patient and asked about recent food exposures. All 21 reported drinking raw milk from the same farm within the 7\u2011day incubation window (6\u201148\u202fh for *Salmonella*). 2. **Laboratory matching** \u2013 Stool samples from patients yielded *Salmonella*\u202fEnteritidis. The same serotype was isolated from a **sealed sample of the raw milk** that the farm had kept for quality\u2011control testing (the farm retained a \u201cbatch\u2011lot\u201d sample as required by state law). Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed **\u2264\u202f2 single\u2011nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** difference between patient isolates and the milk isolate, indicating a common source. 3. **Environmental investigation** \u2013 Inspectors swabbed the milking parlor, bulk\u2011tank, and the cows\u2019 udders. *Salmonella* was recovered from the **bulk\u2011tank interior surface** and from a **udder wash sample** of one cow that had recently been treated for mastitis. 4. **Trace\u2011back of feed & water** \u2013 The farm\u2019s feed was examined; a recent delivery of **silage** had been stored at a temperature that allowed *Salmonella* growth. The same *Salmonella* strain was later isolated from a leftover bag of that silage. 5. **Regulatory action** \u2013 The farm was placed under a **\u201cstop\u2011sale\u201d order** for raw milk, and a recall notice was issued to all members. The farm was required to implement a herd\u2011health plan, improve sanitation of the bulk\u2011tank, and submit monthly pathogen\u2011testing results before the raw\u2011milk program could be reinstated. |\n\n### Key take\u2011aways from the investigation  \n\n| Point | Why it matters |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **All cases reported the same product** | A single\u2011source exposure is the strongest epidemiologic clue. |\n| **Laboratory concordance (WGS) between patient isolates and milk** | Provides molecular proof that the pathogen in the milk caused the illness. |\n| **Isolation of the same strain from the environment (udder, bulk\u2011tank, feed)** | Shows how the bacteria entered the milk supply chain. |\n| **Rapid public\u2011health response** | Early identification, recall, and communication limited the outbreak to a relatively small number of people. |\n| **Regulatory oversight** | Most states that allow raw\u2011milk sales require a \u201cbatch\u2011lot\u201d sample to be retained for testing; that sample was crucial for linking the outbreak. |\n\n*Sources*: Washington State Department of Health \u201c2023 Raw\u2011Milk *Salmonella* Outbreak Report\u201d (published 2024); CDC \u201cOutbreaks of Foodborne Illness Associated with Unpasteurized Milk\u201d (annual summary, 2023\u20112024).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. How a raw\u2011milk outbreak is *traced* in practice  \n\n1. **Case identification** \u2013 Hospitals or labs report a positive culture for a food\u2011borne pathogen to local health departments.  \n2. **Standardised interview** \u2013 Investigators use a \u201cfood history questionnaire\u201d covering the 7\u201114\u202fdays before symptom onset.  \n3. **Hypothesis generation** \u2013 If",

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Pasteurisation Works \u2013 the science behind \u201cheat\u2011kill\u201d and nutrient preservation  \n\n### 1. The basic principle  \n\nPasteurisation is **a controlled heat\u2011treatment that raises milk to a temperature high enough to inactivate (or kill) disease\u2011causing microorganisms, but low enough and brief enough to leave the bulk of milk\u2019s nutritional components essentially unchanged**.  \n\n| Step | What happens inside the milk | Typical time\u2011temperature combo |\n|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Heating** | Milk is pumped through a heat\u2011exchanger. The temperature rises quickly, so bacteria experience the target temperature for only a short period. | HTST: 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds (most U.S. retail milk). LTLT: 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fminutes (used for some specialty or \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d milk). |\n| **Holding** | At the target temperature, heat **denatures proteins** that make up bacterial cell walls, membranes, enzymes, and nucleic acids. This disrupts the cell\u2019s structural integrity and stops metabolism. | The \u201chold\u201d is the 15\u202fs (HTST) or 30\u202fmin (LTLT). |\n| **Rapid cooling** | Milk is cooled to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F) within seconds to prevent any surviving microbes from multiplying. | Cooling to 4\u202f\u00b0C in <\u202f30\u202fs (plate\u2011heat\u2011exchanger). |\n| **Packaging** | The cooled, pasteurised milk is sealed in sterile containers that keep new microbes out. | Aseptic filling or refrigerated bulk\u2011tank storage. |\n\nThe **goal is a >5\u2011log (\u2265\u202f99.999\u202f%) reduction** of the most heat\u2011resistant *pathogenic* bacteria that are known to cause illness in milk (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. What the heat actually does to microorganisms  \n\n| Microbial component | Effect of 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (HTST) |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Cell membrane lipids** | Heat fluidises the phospholipid bilayer, causing leakage of cytoplasmic contents \u2192 cell lysis. |\n| **Proteins (including enzymes)** | Denaturation (unfolding) of structural proteins and key enzymes (e.g., DNA polymerase, ATP synthase). Without functional proteins, the cell cannot maintain homeostasis or replicate. |\n| **Nucleic acids** | High temperature induces **strand breaks** and **pyrimidine dimers** in DNA; repair systems are inactivated. |\n| **Spore\u2011forming bacteria** (e.g., *Clostridium perfringens*, *Bacillus cereus*) | Spores are far more heat\u2011resistant; HTST does **not** reliably kill them, but it inactivates the vegetative cells that cause most acute food\u2011borne disease. Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) processing (\u2265\u202f135\u202f\u00b0C) is required to inactivate most spores. |\n| **Viruses** | Enveloped viruses (e.g., hepatitis A) are readily inactivated; non\u2011enveloped viruses (e.g., norovirus) are also highly susceptible at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs. |\n\n**D\u2011value** (decimal reduction time) is the time at a given temperature needed to reduce a bacterial population by 90\u202f% (1 log). For *Salmonella* in milk at 72\u202f\u00b0C, the D\u2011value is **\u2248\u202f0.2\u202fseconds**. So a 15\u2011second hold gives a 75\u2011log reduction\u2014far beyond what is needed for safety.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Why most nutrients survive the heat  \n\n| Nutrient class | Heat stability & typical loss during HTST | Reason it survives |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Proteins (casein, whey proteins)** | **Very stable**; denaturation is minimal. Casein micelles are heat\u2011resistant; whey proteins (\u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin, \u03b1\u2011lactalbumin) may unfold slightly but regain functional structure on cooling. | The temperature is below the *cooking*",
