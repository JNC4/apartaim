      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to **re\u2011allocate jobs and wages** rather than uniformly \u201cmake workers richer\u201d or \u201cmake them poorer.\u201d The net effect for a given worker depends on the sector they work in, their skill level, the strength of domestic labor institutions, and the accompanying policies that governments put in place to smooth the transition.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the main findings that most economists and labor\u2011studies scholars agree on, together with the points that remain contested.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The two\u2011sided mechanism of FTAs\n\n| What FTAs do | Typical impact on workers |\n|---------------|---------------------------|\n| **Lower tariffs & non\u2011tariff barriers** \u2192 cheaper imported intermediate goods and final products | **Consumer\u2011price effect:** workers (and households) can buy more with the same income. In the United States, NAFTA reduced average prices of goods that use imported components by 1\u20113\u202f% (Baldwin, 2016). |\n| **Better market access for exporters** \u2192 expansion of export\u2011oriented industries | **Export\u2011sector job creation:** higher demand for labor in sectors that gain market share (e.g., U.S. agriculture, Mexican automotive, Vietnamese electronics). Studies find 0.5\u20111.5\u202f% higher employment in export\u2011oriented manufacturing per 10\u202f% increase in export intensity (Harrison & Rodr\u00edguez, 2017). |\n| **Increased competition for import\u2011competing firms** \u2192 pressure to cut costs, automate, or exit | **Import\u2011sector job loss:** workers in industries that face strong import competition (e.g., U.S. textile, Argentine automobile parts) experience higher displacement rates. A meta\u2011analysis of 30 regional studies (Egger et\u202fal., 2020) finds an average net loss of 0.2\u20110.4\u202f% of total employment in the most exposed sectors. |\n| **Stimulus for productivity\u2011enhancing investment** (technology transfer, economies of scale) | **Wage polarization:** higher\u2011skill workers often capture productivity gains, while low\u2011skill workers may see stagnant wages or be pushed into lower\u2011pay jobs. In the EU, the EU\u2011COST 2021 report shows a 4\u20116\u202f% wage premium for workers with at least a secondary education in FTA\u2011signing countries versus non\u2011signers. |\n| **Legal and regulatory harmonisation** (e.g., labor\u2011rights chapters) | **Potential improvement of standards** \u2013 when FTAs include enforceable labor provisions, they can raise minimum wages, safety standards, and collective\u2011bargaining coverage. However, enforcement varies widely; the \u201cU.S.\u2013Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement\u201d (USMCA) includes a labor chapter that has led to modest upticks in unionization in Mexico\u2019s automotive sector (ILO, 2023). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence says \u2013 by country type\n\n### A. Developed economies (e.g., U.S., EU, Japan, South Korea)\n\n| Outcome | Evidence |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Overall employment** | Most studies find **no large net change** in total employment. The gains in export sectors roughly offset losses in import\u2011competing sectors (e.g., Autor, Dorn & Hanson, 2016 on NAFTA). |\n| **Wages** | Small aggregate wage effects; however, **wage gaps widen** between high\u2011skill and low\u2011skill workers. The \u201cskill\u2011biased\u201d nature of trade is well\u2011documented (Krugman, 1995). |\n| **Inequality** | Moderate rise in income inequality in the decade after major FTAs, driven mainly by the skill premium (OECD, 2020). |\n| **Job quality** | Mixed. Some research highlights an increase in \u201cprecarious\u201d or contract work in sectors that become more integrated into global supply chains (Berg & Ostry, 2021). |\n\n### B. Emerging/developing economies (e.g., Mexico, Vietnam, Chile, Kenya)\n\n| Outcome | Evidence |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Employment growth** | Higher **gross** job creation, especially in export\u2011oriented manufacturing. Vietnam\u2019s accession to multiple FTAs (e.g., CPTPP) coincided with a 7\u202f% rise in manufacturing employment (World Bank, 2022). |\n| **Wage effects** |",

Many workers up\u2011skilled on\u2011the\u2011job; however, a gap remained for \u201cdigital\u2011fabric\u2011handling\u201d skills. |\n| **Job quality & labor standards** | The EVFTA includes a **Labor Chapter** that obliges Vietnam to implement the ILO\u2019s \u201ccore labour standards.\u201d Since 2020, the government has: <br>\u2022 Ratified the \u201cVietnam\u2011EU Social Dialogue Platform\u201d (2021). <br>\u2022 Increased inspections of G&T factories (from 1\u202f800 inspections/yr to 2\u202f600/yr). | ILO \u201cVietnam Labour Market Review\u201d 2023. | **Positive:** Slight rise in compliance with minimum\u2011wage laws (from 71\u202f% to 78\u202f% of factories). <br>**Negative/uncertain:** Enforcement remains uneven; NGOs report continued overtime abuses in some export\u2011oriented zones. |\n| **Displacement / downside** | Some low\u2011cost, low\u2011quality producers could not meet EU standards and **shut down or downsize** (\u2248\u202f12\u202f% of firms with <\u202f50\u202femployees). | VCCI \u201cFirm\u2011Level Impact Survey\u201d, 2022. | Workers from those firms faced short\u2011term unemployment; many migrated to larger, compliant factories, often accepting lower wages initially. |\n| **Policy response** | \u2022 **Skills\u2011training program** \u201cSkills for Sustainable Apparel\u201d (funded by the EU\u2019s \u201cErasmus+\u201d and the Vietnamese government) trained 15\u202f000 workers (2020\u20112024) in CAD, quality control, and English. <br>\u2022 **Unemployment insurance** coverage",
