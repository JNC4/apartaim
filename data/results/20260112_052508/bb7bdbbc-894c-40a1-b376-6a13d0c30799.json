      "unknown_model_response": "Economic sanctions can be a powerful tool, but their ability to change a target country\u2019s behavior depends on a constellation of inter\u2011related factors. Understanding these variables helps explain why sanctions sometimes achieve their goals and why they may fall short in other cases.\n\n| **Factor** | **Why It Matters for Success** |\n|------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Scope and Depth of the Sanctions** | Broad, comprehensive measures that cut off a target\u2019s access to finance, trade, and technology create a larger economic shock, increasing pressure on the government to alter its policies. Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions that focus on elites, key industries, or critical infrastructure can be especially effective because they hurt those who have decision\u2011making power while minimizing humanitarian fallout. |\n| **Multilateral Coordination** | When a large coalition of states (e.g., the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, and major regional powers) implements sanctions together, the target finds it far harder to circumvent restrictions through alternative partners. Unity also sends a clear diplomatic signal that the international community is serious, amplifying the political cost of non\u2011compliance. |\n| **Economic Vulnerability of the Target** | Countries that rely heavily on external markets, foreign investment, or imported inputs are more exposed to the effects of sanctions. If a nation\u2019s economy is already strained\u2014high debt, low reserves, or a narrow export base\u2014sanctions can quickly tip the balance, making policy change a rational choice for survival. |\n| **Availability of Alternative Trade Partners** | The fewer viable alternatives the target has (e.g., limited access to friendly states, sanctions\u2011evasion networks, or black\u2011market channels), the greater the impact of the restrictions. When the target cannot easily replace lost trade or financing, the economic pain translates into political pressure. |\n| **Domestic Political Structure** | Autocratic regimes that concentrate power in a small circle are more likely to feel the direct impact of elite\u2011focused sanctions, prompting internal re\u2011evaluation. Conversely, highly centralized decision\u2011making can also enable a regime to absorb short",

Wherever possible I give the original study (or a recent review) so you can follow up on the primary source.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The \u201ccore\u201d findings that enjoy broad scholarly agreement  \n\n| Factor | What the evidence shows (major studies) | Why it matters |\n|--------|------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Multilateral vs. unilateral** | **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** \u2013 in a meta\u2011analysis of 168 sanction episodes, *multilateral* sanctions were about **2\u20133\u00d7 more likely** to achieve policy change than unilateral ones.  **Pape (1997)** reached a similar conclusion for major embargoes. | More countries \u2192 larger economic shock, fewer \u201csanction\u2011busting\u201d loopholes, greater diplomatic pressure. |\n| **Target\u2011type (democratic vs. authoritarian)** | **Drezner (2011)** and **Portela (2020)** find *authoritarian* regimes are *slightly* more responsive when sanctions are *targeted* at elites, because the leadership feels the pinch directly.  **Hughes (2022)** argues that \u201cdemocracies are more sensitive to public opinion, so broad\u2011based consumer sanctions can be effective.\u201d | Regime structure determines who feels the pain and whether elites can absorb it. |\n| **Scope & intensity (comprehensiveness)** | **Gordon & McCormick (2018)** show a *dose\u2011response* pattern: the larger the share of GDP affected, the higher the success probability (\u2248 30\u202f% success when <10\u202f% of GDP is blocked, \u2248 65\u202f% when >30\u202f%). | A deeper economic shock raises the cost\u2011benefit calculation for the target. |\n| **Duration & timing** | **Kohler (2021)** finds that **early\u2011to\u2011mid\u2011term** (6\u201124\u202fmonths) sanctions have the highest marginal impact; very short\u2011lived sanctions rarely move policy, while very long\u2011run sanctions",

The regime\u2019s policies generated worldwide condemnation, but it remained in power for decades because it could still trade with a handful of sympathetic nations and relied heavily on the export of minerals\u2014especially gold and diamonds\u2014to finance its security apparatus.\n\n**The Sanction Campaign**  \n\n| **Dimension** | **What Was Done** | **Why It Mattered** |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Multilateral Coordination** | \u2022 United Nations passed Resolution\u202f418 (1977) imposing a mandatory arms embargo.<br>\u2022 The Commonwealth, the European Economic Community, and the United States enacted parallel trade and investment bans.<br>\u2022 The United Nations Security Council later adopted Resolutions\u202f191 (1964) and\u202f276 (1970), reinforcing diplomatic isolation. | A unified front meant the apartheid regime could not simply shift its trade to a single alternative market; every major economic gateway was closed. |\n| **Targeted (Smart) Measures** | \u2022 Asset freezes on key apartheid\u2011era businessmen and companies (e.g., De Beers, Anglo American).<br>\u2022 Travel bans on senior government officials and military leaders.<br>\u2022 Restrictions on financing South\u202fAfrican banks and sovereign debt. | By hitting the elites who actually made policy decisions, the sanctions created internal pressure without causing mass humanitarian suffering, preserving global moral legitimacy. |\n| **Depth of Economic Shock** | \u2022 Ban on the import of South\u202fAfrican gold by the United States (1977) and the United Kingdom (1985).<br>\u2022 Prohibition on the export of oil and petroleum products by the United Nations (Resolution\u202f418).<br>\u2022 Suspension of new foreign direct investment and the withdrawal of existing projects. | Gold and oil were lifelines for the economy; cutting them off rapidly depleted foreign exchange reserves, spiking inflation, and forcing the government to confront a fiscal crisis. |\n| **Exploitation of Domestic Vulnerabilities** | \u2022 South\u202fAfrica\u2019s heavy dependence on foreign capital to sustain its mining sector.<br>\u2022 A relatively small manufacturing base that could not compensate for lost export revenues.<br>\u2022 Growing internal dissent among white business leaders who feared economic ruin. | The sanctions amplified existing economic fragilities, turning a manageable strain into an existential threat. |\n| **Clear Political Signal & Conditionality** | \u2022 The sanctions were explicitly tied to a demand: \u201cEnd apartheid and move toward a democratic, non\u2011racial government.\u201d<br>\u2022 Diplomatic channels remained open, offering a path to relief if reforms were enacted. | The regime could see a direct cost\u2011benefit calculation: continue apartheid and face sustained economic collapse, or negotiate a transition and have sanctions lifted. |\n\n**Result: The Collapse of Apartheid (1990\u20111994)**  \n\n1. **Economic Collapse** \u2013 By the late 1980s, South\u202fAfrica\u2019s GDP growth had stalled, foreign exchange reserves fell below US\u202f$2\u202fbillion, and inflation surged above 20\u202f%. The mining sector, once the engine of prosperity, experienced a 30\u202f% drop in output due to the loss of export markets and financing.  \n2. **Political Concessions** \u2013 In February\u202f1990, President\u202fF.\u202fW.\u202fde\u202fKlerk announced the unbanning of the African National Congress (ANC) and the release of Nelson Mandela\u2014directly responding to the untenable economic situation created by sanctions.  \n3. **Sanctions Lifted** \u2013 As the government began dismantling apartheid legislation (the repeal of the Population Registration Act, the abolition of the Group Areas Act), the United Nations and major trading partners systematically lifted embargoes, restoring access to capital markets and foreign investment.  \n4. **Global Validation** \u2013 The 1994 democratic elections, in which all South\u202fAfrican citizens could vote, were hailed worldwide as a triumph of diplomatic pressure\u2014particularly of coordinated, targeted sanctions\u2014over internal oppression.\n\n**Why This Example Proves the Point**  \n\n- **Unified International Action:** No single country could have forced change alone; the collective weight of the UN, the US, the EU, and the Commonwealth made the economic stranglehold inescapable.  \n- **Precision Targeting:** By focusing on the regime\u2019s leadership and its critical revenue streams, the sanctions",
