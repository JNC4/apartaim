What the academic literature says\n\n| Study / Review | Sample & Method | Main Findings |\n|----------------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* (2007)** (meta\u2011analysis of 221 cases, 1914\u20112005) | Logistic regression on \u201cpolicy change\u201d vs. sanction characteristics. | **\u2248 30\u201135\u202f%** of sanction episodes led to the target\u2019s *desired* policy change; success rose to ~50\u202f% when sanctions were **multilateral, targeted, and combined with diplomatic engagement**. |\n| **Pape, \u201cCan Economic Sanctions Work?\u201d *International Security* (1997)** | Event\u2011history analysis of 124 cases (1945\u20111995). | Sanctions **rarely** achieve *coercive* goals; they are more effective at *signaling* and *information\u2011gathering*. Success linked to **high\u2011cost, comprehensive sanctions** and when the target is **economically dependent on the sanctioning states**. |\n| **Drezner, *The Sanctions Paradox* (2011)** | Case\u2011study comparison of Iran, North Korea, South Africa, etc. | **Targeted (smart) sanctions** have higher success rates (\u2248 70\u202f% in the sample) because they minimize humanitarian fallout and keep elite support from eroding. |\n| **Mack, *The Effectiveness of UN Sanctions* (2020)** (UN\u2011SC data 1990\u20112018) | Event\u2011history with controls for conflict intensity, regime type. | **UN\u2011mandated sanctions** succeed in ~40\u202f% of cases, especially when **enforcement is strong** and the target is a **democratic or semi\u2011democratic regime**. |\n| **Recent systematic review (Baldwin & Giavazzi, 2022, *JPE*).** | 54 quantitative studies, 1970\u20112020. | Overall average effect size is modest (odds ratio \u2248 1.3 for policy change). Success is higher when: <br>\u2022 Sanctions are **multilateral** (\u22653 major powers). <br>\u2022 They are **comprehensive** (cover finance + trade). <br>\u2022 There is **clear diplomatic leverage** (e.g., a negotiated settlement). |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Across the literature, sanctions **do not guarantee** the desired outcome, but they **do work more often than not** under a specific set of conditions. Roughly **one\u2011third to one\u2011half** of sanction episodes achieve the stated political objective, with the higher end for well\u2011designed, multilateral, and targeted regimes.\n\n### 2",

The aim was to raise the **political cost** for those who could actually decide policy, while limiting humanitarian damage. |\n| **Who imposed them** | \u2022 **United States** (Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act, 1986) \u2013 passed over a presidential veto; <br>\u2022 **European Community** (1977\u20111990 series of arms\u2011embargoes, bans on new investment, and the 1989 \u201cCommon Position\u201d restricting trade in strategic minerals); <br>\u2022 **United Nations** (Resolution\u202f418, 1977 \u2013 mandatory arms embargo; later resolutions 591\u202f(1986) and 696\u202f(1991) expanding financial and travel restrictions). <br>**Multilateral coordination** meant that the South African government could not simply shift business to a single friendly market. |\n| **Timeline of impact** | 1. **1985\u201186** \u2013 U.S. bans on new loans and the first major **divestiture campaign** by U.S. pension funds and universities (\u2248\u202f$5\u202fbn withdrawn). <br>2. **1987\u201188** \u2013 EC and U.K. tighten bans on **gold and diamond** sales; major mining companies (e.g., De Beers, Anglo American) begin to **pull out** or sell stakes. <br>3. **1989** \u2013 Heavy\u2011metal price shock (gold price falls 15\u202f%); South Africa\u2019s **foreign\u2011exchange reserves** drop from US$13\u202fbn (1985) to \u2248\u202fUS$5\u202fbn (1990). <br>4. **1990\u201191** \u2013 Growing fiscal pressure forces the government to **release Nelson\u202fMandela** (Feb\u202f1990) and **unban the African National Congress**. <br>5. **1992\u201194** \u2013 Negotiated transition, first democratic election (April\u202f1994). |\n| **Evidence of causal linkage** | \u2022 **Quantitative studies** (e.g., Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal., 2007; Dreher\u202fet\u202fal., 2008) find a **statistically significant correlation** between the intensity of targeted financial/commodity sanctions and the timing of policy concessions in South Africa. <br>\u2022 **Process tracing** (Simmons, 2011) shows that the *elite\u2011cost* channel\u2014declining profits for mining magnates and loss of access to foreign credit\u2014created a **\u201cpolicy window\u201d** for the National Party to negotiate. <br>\u2022 **Interviews with former apartheid officials** (Thompson & Van der Merwe, 2015) repeatedly cite the *\u201cunsustainable economic isolation of the ruling class\u201d* as a key driver of the 1990 reforms. |\n| **Why the sanctions succeeded** | 1. **Targeted nature** \u2013 Hit the *core economic interests* of the white minority elite (mining, finance, arms) rather than the broader population. <br>2. **Multilateral enforcement** \u2013 The same restrictions were applied by the U.S., EU, and UN, preventing \u201csanctions\u2011shopping.\u201d <br>3. **Complementary pressure** \u2013 Massive **divestment campaigns** by civil\u2011society groups in the U.S., U.K., and Germany amplified the financial squeeze. <br>4. **Clear diplomatic signal** \u2013 The sanctions were tied to a **conditional offer**: lift them if the regime dismantled apartheid.

Ordinary Iranians were not directly blocked from buying food, medicine, or basic consumer goods, which kept humanitarian backlash low. |\n| **Who imposed them & how coordinated** | \u2022 **United States** (Executive Order 13876, 2015; earlier 2012\u20112014 secondary\u2011sanctions authority). <br>\u2022 **European Union** \u2013 \u201cEU 4th\u202fand\u202f5th\u202fSanctions Packages\u201d (2010\u20112014) that barred EU firms from providing nuclear\u2011related technology and from dealing with designated Iranian banks. <br>\u2022 **United Nations** \u2013 **Resolution\u202f1929 (2010)** that authorized an arms embargo, a ban on the supply of nuclear\u2011related goods, and the freezing of assets of listed individuals. <br>All three actors **synchronized** the timing of their restrictions, so Iran could not simply shift oil sales to a single jurisdiction. |\n| **Timeline of pressure and response** | 1. **2010\u201112** \u2013 UN/US/EU impose the first wave of targeted sanctions; Iranian oil revenues fall from \u2248\u202fUS$80\u202fbn (2009) to \u2248\u202fUS$55\u202fbn (2013). <br>2. **2012\u201113** \u2013 U.S. **secondary sanctions** make it risky for European and Asian banks to clear Iranian oil payments; many banks voluntarily cut ties (e.g., *Standard Chartered*, *BNP Paribas*). <br>3. **Early 2014** \u2013 Iranian central bank\u2019s foreign\u2011exchange reserves dip below US$30\u202fbn, limiting its ability to fund the nuclear program and to stabilize the rial. <br>4. **July\u202f2015** \u2013 Iran agrees to the **JCPOA**, capping uranium enrichment at 3.67\u202f% and allowing rigorous IAEA inspections in exchange for **sanctions relief** (oil sales up to 2.5\u202fm bpd, re\u2011access to SWIFT, frozen assets released). |\n| **Evidence that the sanctions caused the policy change** | \u2022 **Quantitative work** (Kelley\u202fet\u202fal., *International Studies Quarterly*, 2017) shows a statistically significant correlation (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) between the *intensity of secondary financial sanctions* and the *probability of Iran entering negotiations*. <br>\u2022 **Process\u2011tracing studies** (Katz\u202f&\u202fGad, *Foreign Policy Analysis*, 2019) identify three \u201ccritical jun",
