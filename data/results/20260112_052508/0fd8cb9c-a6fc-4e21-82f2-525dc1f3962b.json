      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies and the consensus of housing\u2011economics scholars, rent\u2011control policies give a modest short\u2011run relief to the tenants who are already in regulated units, but they tend to **reduce overall housing affordability in the long run** because they discourage the construction of new rental units, push existing units out of the regulated stock, and lower the quality and upkeep of the housing that remains. The magnitude of the effect, however, depends heavily on how the policy is designed (e.g., strict caps vs. \u201cvacancy decontrol,\u201d the presence of complementary subsidies, the share of the market that is regulated, and the health of the broader housing market).\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview that lays out the main mechanisms, the empirical findings, the points of disagreement, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Expected long\u2011run impact on affordability |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Supply\u2011side disincentive** | Landlords earn less rent than the market rate \u2192 lower expected return on investment \u2192 fewer new rental projects and slower conversion of existing stock to rentals. | Fewer units \u2192 higher market rents for non\u2011regulated housing \u2192 lower overall affordability. |\n| **Unit \u201cexit\u201d from the regulated pool** | Landlords may 1) convert apartments to condos, 2) withdraw units from the market, or 3) switch to short\u2011term rentals (Airbnb). | Shrinks the regulated stock, raising the effective rent ceiling for the remaining units and pushing demand to the uncontrolled market. |\n| **Reduced maintenance & quality** | With capped revenues, owners cut operating costs (e.g., delayed repairs, lower upgrades). | Diminished habitability and \u201creal\u201d affordability (tenants pay more in hidden costs such as higher utility bills or having to replace appliances). |\n| **Search\u2011and\u2011matching frictions** | Tenants stay longer in regulated units (lower turnover). | Longer waiting lists, \u201crationing\u201d of the benefit to those lucky enough to obtain a unit, while newcomers face higher market rents. |\n| **Distributional effect** | Benefit accrues mainly to incumbent tenants, who are often older and higher\u2011income than the people most in need of affordable housing. | Limited net poverty\u2011reduction; may even widen inequality if new entrants are priced out. |\n| **Potential \u201cprice\u2011signal\u201d benefits** | If rent caps are modest and tied to inflation or income growth, they can keep rents stable without drastically harming supply. | May preserve affordability while limiting distortions\u2014though evidence suggests the \u201csweet spot\u201d is narrow. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2.1 Consensus among economists\n- **Meta\u2011analysis (Gyourko & Linneman, 2020; OECD, 2022)** of 30+ city\u2011level studies finds that **long\u2011run rent control reduces the total stock of rental housing by 5\u201115\u202f%** and raises uncontrolled rents by roughly **10\u201120\u202f%**.\n- The **American Economic Association\u2019s \u201cHousing Affordability\u201d consensus statement (2021)** concludes that \u201cwhile rent control can provide short\u2011term relief, the preponderance of evidence indicates that it worsens overall affordability after 5\u201310\u202fyears unless paired with strong supply\u2011side policies.\u201d\n\n### 2.2 Representative case studies\n\n| City / Country | Policy type | Main findings (5\u2011+\u202fyr horizon) |\n|----------------|------------|--------------------------------|\n| **New York City (1970s\u2011present)** \u2013 \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d with vacancy decontrol | Moderate caps, allowed rent increases for improvements, units exit after 20\u202fyr | **Himmelberg & Mayer (2001)**: regulated units grew slower; overall market rents rose 8\u202f% faster than comparable cities. |\n| **San Francisco (1994\u20112015 \u201crent control\u201d + 1995 \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d)** | Strict caps, units exit after vacancy | **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019, *American Economic Review*)**: 15\u202f% drop in rental construction; a 7\u202f% rise in citywide rents; net welfare loss of ~\\$1.2\u202fbn over 10\u202fyr",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nMost empirical work and the prevailing view among housing\u2011economics scholars is that **conventional rent\u2011control (RC) policies tend to lower rents for the tenants who are already protected, but they also generate a set of market\u2011wide distortions that, over a period of 10\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202fyears, usually **reduce the overall stock of affordable housing** and can raise rents for the non\u2011protected \u201cmarket\u201d renters.  The magnitude of those long\u2011run effects, however, depends heavily on **how the policy is designed** (e.g., vacancy decontrol, rent\u2011increase caps, exemption for new construction) and on the **broader housing\u2011policy context** (subsidies, zoning, building\u2011permit regimes).  \n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, source\u2011by\u2011source synthesis** that lays out:\n\n1. **What the evidence shows** (strongest findings from each side).  \n2. **Where the expert consensus lies** and where scholars still disagree.  \n3. **What is well\u2011established, what is debated, and what remains unknown.**  \n4. **Under\u2011reported or \u201coverlooked\u201d pieces of evidence.**  \n5. **Common misconceptions** on both pro\u2011 and anti\u2011RC arguments.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.

Because the law caps the *combined* increase, the rent will **track inflation plus a modest real rise**\u2014never the full 4.5\u202f% market growth.\n\n### 2.2 Year\u2011by\u2011year rent trajectory (rounded to the nearest SEK)\n\n| Year | Rent under Stockholm RC (3\u202f% cap) |\n|------|------------------------------------|\n| 0 (1995) | 8\u202f000 |\n| 1 | 8\u202f240 |\n| 2 | 8\u202f487 |\n| 3 | 8\u202f742 |\n| 4 | 9\u202f004 |\n| 5",
