The net effect on the income of the poorest households is modestly positive in the short run (through lower borrowing costs and a small boost to employment) but **does not offset the wealth\u2011inequality widening** that comes from higher asset prices. |\n| **Middle\u2011income households (home\u2011owners, salaried workers, moderate borrowers)** | \u2022 Same borrowing\u2011cost benefits as low\u2011income groups, often larger because they are more likely to qualify for mortgages. <br>\u2022 If they own a home, rising house prices increase net worth and can ease future borrowing (home\u2011equity loans). | \u2022 If they are **renters**, higher rents hurt. <br>\u2022 Higher asset prices can raise the cost of entry for first\u2011time buyers, pushing them back into renting. | Evidence shows a **significant \u201chome\u2011owner premium.\u201d** Home\u2011owners in QE periods see a measurable rise in net worth, while renters see little direct benefit and may face higher rent pressure. |\n| **Wealthier individuals & large asset owners** (high\u2011net\u2011worth families, pension funds, insurers, corporations) | \u2022 Direct gains from rising prices of stocks, corporate bonds, and especially **real\u2011estate**. <br>\u2022 Lower yields on safe assets let them **re\u2011allocate** into riskier, higher\u2011return investments. | \u2022 Very little downside; the only risk is if QE is withdrawn too abruptly (a \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d) which can cause a sharp price correction. | The **dominant empirical finding** is that QE **increases wealth inequality** because the top 10\u202f% (who hold ~70\u202f% of financial assets in the U.S.) capture the bulk of the asset\u2011price gains. |\n| **Debtors vs. savers** | \u2022 Debtors (mortgage, auto, credit\u2011card users) benefit from lower nominal rates. | \u2022 Savers (especially those holding cash or low\u2011yielding government bonds) see their real returns fall, especially when inflation eventually picks up. | Studies on \u201cinterest\u2011rate redistributive effects\u201d consistently find a **transfer from savers to borrowers** during QE episodes. The magnitude depends on the share of debt that is newly financed versus refinanced. |\n| **Regional / sectoral groups** (e.g., export\u2011oriented vs. import\u2011competing regions) | \u2022 QE typically **depreciates the domestic currency**, helping exporters and regions with export\u2011oriented industries. | \u2022 Import\u2011competing",
