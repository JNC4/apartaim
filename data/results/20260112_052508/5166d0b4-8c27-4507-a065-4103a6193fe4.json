The goal can be coercive (force a policy shift), punitive (punish past behavior), signaling (show disapproval), or normative (encourage respect for human rights). | Trade embargoes, import\u2011export bans, restrictions on specific sectors (oil, arms, finance), asset freezes, limits on access to international payment systems (e.g., SWIFT), and \u201csecondary\u201d sanctions that punish third\u2011party firms that do business with the target. |\n| **Mechanisms that are supposed to create pressure** | 1. **Economic pain** \u2013 reduced export revenues, higher import costs, loss of foreign investment, and limited access to finance raise the overall cost of the target\u2019s policy.  <br>2. **Elite leverage** \u2013 sanctions are often aimed at the political and economic elite (e.g., freezing assets of senior officials, cutting off banks that service the regime).  <br>3. **Domestic political pressure** \u2013 rising inflation, unemployment, or shortages can lead the public to protest or erode elite support for the policy.  <br>4. **International isolation** \u2013 denying access to global markets or financial networks makes it harder for the regime to sustain itself and can deter allies.  <br>5. **Signaling & credibility** \u2013 a well\u2011designed sanction package signals that the sanctioning coalition is serious and willing to bear costs, which can deter escalation. |  \u2022 **Comprehensive embargoes** (e.g., Cuba, Iran pre\u20112015) \u2013 block most trade. <br>\u2022 **Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions** \u2013 freeze assets of individuals, restrict travel, or cut off specific firms (e.g., Russia\u2019s 2022 sanctions on oligarchs). <br>\u2022 **Sectoral sanctions** \u2013 limit a key export (oil, diamonds) or a key technology (semiconductors). <br>\u2022 **Financial sanctions** \u2013 cut off SWIFT access, prohibit correspondent banking, block sovereign debt issuance. |\n| **Design features that increase the chance of success** | \u2022 **Clear, limited objectives** \u2013 the demanded policy change is specific and measurable. <br>\u2022 **Multilateral support** \u2013 the more countries that enforce the measures, the fewer loopholes. <br>\u2022 **Adequate leverage** \u2013 the target must value the blocked goods/services enough to care. <br>\u2022 **Targeting of elites** rather than the general population reduces humanitarian fallout and raises the chance that decision\u2011makers feel the pain. <br>\u2022 **Exit\u2011strategy / \u201ccarrot\u201d** \u2013 a credible promise that sanctions will be lifted once demands are met. | See Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott (2007) for a taxonomy of these design elements. |\n\n---\n\n### What the evidence says about **success rates**\n\n| Study (year) | Sample & method | Overall \u201csuccess\u201d rate* | Key take\u2011aways |\n",

The demand was **clear, specific, and verifiable**: repeal apartheid laws and hold free elections. | Clear goals gave both the sanctioning coalition and the South African government a concrete yardstick for \u201ccompliance.\u201d |\n| **Coalition** | \u2013 **UN Security\u2011Council Resolution\u202f418 (1977)** imposed a mandatory arms embargo.<br>\u2013 **U.S.** and **EU** (then the European Community) enacted **comprehensive trade bans** (e.g., the U.S. *Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act* of 1986).<br>\u2013 Over **80\u202fcountries** imposed some form of restriction; many multinational firms voluntarily withdrew. | **Multilateral pressure** closed the most lucrative loopholes. The more countries that participated, the fewer ways the regime could reroute trade or obtain weapons. |\n| **Scope & targeting** | \u2022 **Broad trade embargo** on coal, steel, oil, and most manufactured goods.<br>\u2022 **Financial sanctions:** U.S. and European banks were barred from new loans to the South African government and major corporations.<br>\u2022 **Targeted measures:** travel bans and asset freezes on senior officials (e.g., the \u201cSanctions Board\u201d list). | The **combination of sector\u2011wide and elite\u2011focused tools** hit both the macro\u2011economy (declining export revenues) and the personal wealth of the ruling class, making the cost of maintaining apartheid visible to those who could actually change policy. |\n| **Economic impact** | \u2022 **GDP fell** from ~US$ 97\u202fbn (1985) to ~US$\u202f86\u202fbn (1990) \u2013 a 10\u202f% contraction, with a **real\u2011exchange\u2011rate depreciation of ~30\u202f%**.<br>\u2022 **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** dropped by more than **50\u202f%** between 1985\u20111990 (World Bank data).<br>\u2022 **Unemployment** rose sharply, especially in mining and manufacturing, creating widespread social unrest. | The **loss of export earnings (especially gold and diamonds)** and the **sharp curtailment of capital flows** raised the cost of staying the course for both the government and the business elite that financed it. |\n| **Domestic political effect** | \u2022 The **economic squeeze** weakened the ruling National Party\u2019s fiscal base, forcing it to seek new revenue sources and to negotiate with opposition groups.<br>\u2022 **Business leaders** (e.g., the \u201cSouth African Business Coalition\u201d) began to lobby for reform because sanctions threatened their profitability.<br>\u2022 **Public protests** grew as inflation and shortages hit ordinary citizens, eroding the regime\u2019s legitimacy. | By making **elite groups\u2014who had the power to change policy\u2014feel the pain directly**, the sanctions created a **\u201celite incentive\u201d** to pursue a negotiated settlement. |\n| **Exit/\u201ccarrot\u201d** | The **U.S. and European governments** signaled that sanctions would be lifted **once** substantive reforms began: release of political prisoners, repeal of key apartheid statutes, and the start of a transition to majority rule. | A **credible promise of relief** gave the South African leadership a clear payoff for conceding, making the cost\u2011benefit calculation favorable. |\n| **Result** | - **1990:** Mandela released; many apartheid laws repealed.<br>- **1991\u20111993:** Progressive dismantling of the legal framework; most sanctions lifted.<br>- **1994:** First multiracial elections; apartheid officially ended. | The **timeline** (roughly 5\u20117\u202fyears from the peak of sanctions to a negotiated settlement) matches the period in which the **economic costs** became unsustainable for the regime. |\n\n#### What the academic literature says\n\n| Source |",
