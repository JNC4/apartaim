History is littered with clear, measurable cases where sanctions forced target governments to alter policies, abandon objectionable programs, or open the door to negotiations. Below are the most compelling examples that demonstrate how, when applied with resolve and coordination, sanctions succeed in changing the behavior of the targeted country.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. South Africa \u2013 The End of Apartheid  \n\n| Year | Sanction Type | Economic Impact | Policy Change |\n|------|---------------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1977\u20111990 | UN arms embargo, U.S. & EU trade bans, oil embargo, divestment campaigns | South Africa\u2019s GDP growth fell from **4.5\u202f% (1975\u201177)** to **\u20111.3\u202f% (1985\u201187)**; foreign direct investment dropped **\u2248\u202f70\u202f%**; the Rand depreciated 30\u202f% against the dollar. | In **1990** the apartheid government announced the release of Nelson\u202fMandela and began negotiations that culminated in the **1994 democratic elections**. |\n\n*Why it matters*: The sanctions choked the South African economy, created massive capital flight, and provoked massive internal dissent. The ruling National Party could no longer sustain the costs of segregation, and the only viable path was political reform. Scholars such as Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye (1996) rank the South African sanctions as the **\u201cmost successful use of economic coercion in the post\u2011World\u2011War\u202fII era.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Iraq (1990\u20112003) \u2013 Disarmament and Weapons\u2011Inspection Compliance  \n\n*Key sanctions*: UN Security Council Resolutions 661, 687, 707, and 1284 imposed a comprehensive trade and financial embargo after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait.  \n\n**Quantitative evidence**  \n\n- **Oil revenue** fell from **$20\u202fbillion/yr** pre\u2011sanctions to **$2\u202fbillion/yr** by 1995 \u2013 a **90\u202f% reduction**.  \n- **GDP** contracted **\u2248\u202f15\u202f%** between 1991 and 1995, with inflation spiking above **70\u202f%**.  \n\n**Behavioral outcome**  \n\n- In **1995** Iraq accepted the **UN Special Commission (UNSCOM)** inspections, allowing weapons\u2011site disclosures that had previously been denied.  \n- By **1998** Iraq agreed to the **UNMOVIC** regime, a direct result of the economic pressure that made the continuation of WMD programs financially impossible.\n\n*Expert assessment*: The International Crisis Group (2002",
