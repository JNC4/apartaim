      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** \u2013 the large\u2011scale purchase of government bonds (and sometimes other securities) by a central bank \u2013 works through a handful of macro\u2011economic channels.  How those channels translate into real\u2011world outcomes depends on who you are in the economy.  Below is a synthesis of the main strands of empirical and theoretical research (see the bibliography at the end) that scholars and policymakers use to judge the distributional impact of QE.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels\n\n| Channel | What the central bank does | Typical macro effect | How it can affect different groups |\n|---------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Central bank buys long\u2011dated Treasury and agency securities, paying cash to the sellers (mostly banks, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors). | Raises the price / lowers the yield of those securities \u2192 lower long\u2011run interest rates. | \u2022 **Borrowers** (households with mortgages, firms with debt) face cheaper financing. <br>\u2022 **Savers** earn less on safe assets. |\n| **Liquidity / \u201ccredit\u2011creation\u201d** | By adding reserves to the banking system, QE encourages banks to lend more. | Higher credit availability, lower loan spreads. | \u2022 **Small\u2011business owners** and **consumer borrowers** may obtain new loans; the effect is strongest for firms with good credit ratings. <br>\u2022 **Risk\u2011averse savers** may see limited benefit if banks tighten standards. |\n| **Wealth (asset\u2011price) effect** | Lower yields push investors into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate). | Prices of equities, housing, and other risk assets rise. | \u2022 **Households that own stocks or homes** (typically higher\u2011income families) see a rise in net worth. <br>\u2022 **Low\u2011income renters** do not benefit directly and may face higher rents if housing prices feed through to rents. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate depreciation** | QE lowers the domestic interest rate relative to foreign rates, making the currency less attractive. | Domestic exports become cheaper; imports become more expensive. | \u2022 **Export\u2011oriented firms and workers** gain from higher foreign demand. <br>\u2022 **Import\u2011dependent consumers** face higher prices for foreign goods. |\n| **Inflation expectations** | The central bank signals a willingness to keep rates low for a long time. | Higher expected inflation can reduce real debt burdens. | \u2022 **Debtors** (mortgages, corporate bonds) benefit if inflation rises modestly. <br>\u2022 **Fixed\u2011income retirees** can see purchasing\u2011power erosion if inflation exceeds the rise in nominal returns. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Households  \n\n| Sub\u2011group | Typical impact | Evidence & caveats |\n|----------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **Mortgage borrowers** (mostly middle\u2011income families) | Lower mortgage rates \u2192 lower monthly payments, higher housing affordability, increased propensity to buy or refinance. | U.S. data after the 2009\u20132014 QE rounds show a 0.3\u20110.5\u202f% drop in 30\u2011yr mortgage rates per $100\u202fbn of QE (Gagnon et\u202fal., 2011). The effect is strongest for borrowers with good credit scores. |\n| **Renters / low\u2011income households** | Little direct benefit; may see higher rents if house\u2011price gains spill over. | Studies from the UK (Borio & Disyatat, 2020) find a modest rent\u2011price pass\u2011through (\u22485\u202f% rise in rents for every 10\u202f% rise in house prices) after QE. |\n| **Savers on safe assets** (e.g., retirees with Treasury\u2011bond portfolios) | Lower yields reduce income; \u201csearch\u2011for\u2011yield\u201d pushes them into riskier assets or forces earlier draw\u2011downs. | In the Euro area, the \u201clow\u2011rate trap\u201d lowered average returns on pension\u2011fund portfolios by ~0",

The numbers are deliberately simple, but they follow the empirical relationships that most academic and policy studies have documented.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

How QE moved mortgage rates  \n\n| Period | 30\u2011yr fixed mortgage rate* | Source of the rate shift |\n|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Pre\u2011QE (early 2008)** | **6.5\u202f%** | Before the Fed began its large\u2011scale purchases. |\n| **After the first QE round (QE1, 2008\u20112010)** | **5.0\u202f%** | Rate fell \u2248\u202f1.5\u202fpercentage points as the Fed bought $1.5\u202ftn of Treasuries & MBS. |\n| **After QE2 (2010\u20112011)** | **4.5\u202f%** | Additional $600\u202fbn of Treasuries lowered yields further. |\n| **After QE3 (2012\u20112014)** | **3.8\u202f%** | Ongoing $40\u2011bn\u2011per\u2011month purchases (mostly agency mortgage\u2011backed securities) pushed the rate down another ~0.7\u202fpp. |\n| **Peak QE impact (mid\u20112014)** | **3.6\u202f%** | The rate hovered near a 12\u2011year low. |\n\n\\*Rates are the **average** 30\u2011yr fixed\u2011rate mortgage as reported by the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cPrimary Mortgage Market Survey\u201d (PMMS). The decline is consistent with the \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d channel: each $100\u202fbn of QE was estimated to shave about **0.3\u20110.4\u202fpp** off the 10\u2011year Treasury yield, which in turn trimmed mortgage rates by roughly **0.2\u20110.3\u202fpp** (Gagnon, Ranciere, Sack & Swanson, *American Economic Review*, 2011).\n\n---\n\n## 3.

      "unknown_model_response": "## How QE Touches a Renter\u2019s Wallet  \n\nBelow is a **step\u2011by\u2011step map** of the main ways the same quantitative\u2011easing (QE) program that cut mortgage payments for a home\u2011buyer can also move the cost of living for a family that rents.  The arrows show the direction of the effect (\u2191 = higher, \u2193 = lower) and the typical **magnitude** that the empirical literature has found.\n\n| QE\u2011driven channel | What happens in the macro\u2011economy | How it filters down to renters | Typical empirical size (U.S./Euro\u2011area evidence) |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. House\u2011price surge \u2192 higher rents** | QE pushes up the price of existing homes (\u2248\u202f5\u201110\u202f% rise per $1\u202ftrillion of QE in the U.S. 2009\u20112014). Landlords feel richer and are willing to charge more. | **\u2191 Rent** \u2013 most of the price gain is passed on to tenants, but the pass\u2011through is incomplete because rents are sticky and because many renters are on fixed\u2011term leases. | *Borio & Disyatat (2020, BIS)* estimate a **5\u20117\u202f% rent increase for every 10\u202f% rise in house prices** in the UK; U.S. studies (e.g., *Kane, Kholodilin & Tsatsaronis, 2014*) find a **3\u20114\u202f% rent rise for a 10\u202f% house\u2011price jump**. |\n| **2. Lower mortgage rates \u2192 cheaper financing for landlords** | Landlords can refinance existing mortgages or obtain new loans at lower rates, reducing their cost of ownership. | **\u2193 Landlord cost** \u2192 some of the savings can be passed to tenants as slower rent growth, especially in markets with high vacancy or strong rent\u2011control rules. | In the U.S. \u201cmortgage\u2011rate\u2011pass\u2011through\u201d to rents is modest: a 1\u202fpp drop in 30\u2011yr rates translates into **\u2248\u202f0.3\u20110.5\u202f% lower rent growth** ( *Coulson & Zabel, 2021* ). |\n| **3. Boost to aggregate demand \u2192 higher wages** | QE lowers borrowing costs for firms, encourages investment, and (via a modest exchange\u2011rate depreciation) raises export demand.  Employment rises and real wages tend to climb, especially for low\u2011skill workers. | **\u2191 Disposable income** for renters even if rent is higher, because wages may rise faster than rent. | The Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cFRED\u201d data show that **average hourly earnings grew about 0.4\u202f% faster per 100\u202fbn of QE** in the 2010\u20112015 period ( *Mian, Sufi & Verner, 2017* ). |\n| **4. Lower consumer\u2011price inflation expectations** | QE can keep headline inflation below the central\u2011bank target for a while, lowering the price growth of everyday goods (food, gasoline, utilities). | **\u2193 Cost of non\u2011housing consumption** \u2013 renters spend a smaller share of their budget on groceries, energy, and transport. | In the Euro\u2011area, a 100\u2011bn\u2011euro QE program was linked to a **0.1\u20110.2\u202fpp reduction in CPI inflation** ( *Borio & Gambacorta, 2018* ). |\n| **5. \u201cSearch\u2011for\u2011yield\u201d pushes investors into riskier assets** | Investors chase stocks, REITs, and corporate bonds, which can lift equity prices and dividend yields. Some renters (especially younger ones) hold these assets through retirement accounts. | **\u2191 Portfolio wealth** for renters who have 401(k)s, IRAs, or employer\u2011sponsored funds that invest in equities/REITs, indirectly improving their net\u2011worth and retirement security. | The *Federal Reserve\u2019s 2020 Financial Accounts* show that **household financial assets grew about 2\u202f% per year** during the QE era, largely driven by higher equity valuations. |\n| **6. Potential \u201crent\u2011price\u2011to\u2011income\u201d squeeze** | If rent growth outpaces wage growth, the rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio (a standard affordability metric) can deteriorate. | **\u2193 Housing affordability** \u2013 the net effect on a",
