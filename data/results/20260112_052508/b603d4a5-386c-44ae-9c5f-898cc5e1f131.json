The outbreak spanned three states (Texas, New\u202fMexico, Colorado) because the farm shipped bulk raw milk to multiple herd\u2011share members. |\n| **Clinical picture** | Median age\u202f=\u202f22\u202fyears (range\u202f=\u202f2\u202fmonths\u201371\u202fyears). \u202fSymptoms: watery/bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, vomiting. \u202fNo deaths, but **8 hospitalisations** (\u2248\u202f11\u202f% of cases). |\n| **Source of contamination** | - **Cow\u2011level carriage**: *C. jejuni* is common in the intestinal tracts of cattle; healthy cows can shed 10\u2074\u201310\u2078\u202fCFU\u202f/\u202fg of feces.<br>- **Milking hygiene breach**: The investigation found **inadequate udder cleaning** and **use of a single\u2011bucket milking system** that was not regularly sanitized.
