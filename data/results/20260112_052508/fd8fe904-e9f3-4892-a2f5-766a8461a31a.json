In the general infant population the background rate is about 1\u202fcase per\u202f4,000\u202f\u2013\u202f5,000 infants per year. |\n| **How it was first detected** | 1. **Post\u2011licensure surveillance** in several countries (Australia, Mexico, United States) used **active monitoring systems** (e.g., the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, national health\u2011record linkages). <br>2. Within the first few years after RotaTeq\u2019s launch, a **statistically significant increase** in intussusception was observed **within 7\u202fdays after the first dose** (\u2248\u202f1\u20132 excess cases per 100,000 vaccinated infants).<br>3. Similar signals appeared for Rotarix, though the magnitude was smaller. |\n| **Scientific investigation** | \u2022 **Case\u2011control studies** (e.g., the CDC\u2019s \u201cself\u2011controlled case series\u201d) compared the incidence of intussusception in the risk window (0\u20117\u202fdays post\u2011dose) to other time periods in the same child, confirming a temporal association.<br>\u2022 **Meta\u2011analyses** pooled data from the U.S., Australia, Latin America, and Europe, estimating an overall risk of **\u2248\u202f1\u20132 additional cases per 100,000 infants** for the first dose of the pentavalent vaccine and **\u2248\u202f0.5\u20131 case per 100,000** for the monovalent vaccine. |\n| **Regulatory and public\u2011health response** | 1. **Label updates** \u2013 The product inserts were revised to list intussusception as a **\u201crare but serious adverse event.\u201d**<br>2. **Risk\u2011benefit communication** \u2013 The CDC, FDA, and WHO issued fact sheets explaining that the absolute risk is tiny compared with the benefits (\u2248\u202f50\u2013100 hospitalizations prevented per 1,000\u202f\u2013\u202f2,000 vaccinated infants).<br>3. **Vaccination schedule guidance** \u2013 The recommendation to **administer the first dose as early as possible (6\u202fweeks of age)** and **complete the series by 8\u202fmonths** was reinforced, because the background risk of intussusception rises after 6\u202fmonths, whereas the vaccine\u2011associated risk is confined to the first week after dosing. <br>4. **Enhanced surveillance** \u2013 The FDA\u2019s **Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) program** and the CDC\u2019s **Vaccine Safety Datalink** continued active monitoring, now with a specific \u201cintussusception\u201d query built into routine analyses. |\n| **Outcome after the response** | \u2022 The **overall safety profile** remains excellent. In the United States, from 2006\u202f\u2013\u202f2023 >\u202f150\u202fmillion rotavirus vaccine doses have been administered; the observed excess of intussusception cases is estimated at **\u2248\u202f50\u201370 cases total**, far outweighed by the **\u2248\u202f25,000\u201330,000 rotavirus\u2011related hospitalizations prevented** in the same period.<br>\u2022 No further safety signals of a different nature have emerged, and the vaccine continues to be **strongly recommended** for all infants at 2, 4 (and 6) months of age. |\n| **Key lessons for the broader vaccine system** | 1. **Active post\u2011licensure surveillance** can detect events that are too rare to appear in Phase\u202fIII trials (which usually involve \u2264\u202f30,000 participants).<br>2. **Rapid data analysis** and",
