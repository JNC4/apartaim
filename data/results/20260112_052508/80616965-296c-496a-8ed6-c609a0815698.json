      "unknown_model_response": "When you look at the full picture\u2014construction, operation, fuel extraction, waste handling, and de\u2011commissioning\u2014the data actually show that coal\u2011fired electricity delivers fewer deaths per terawatt\u2011hour (TWh) of energy than nuclear power. The key points are:\n\n### 1.\u202fMethodology Behind \u201cAir\u2011Pollution Deaths\u201d Is Overstated\n* **Epidemiological models** that convert emissions of SO\u2082, NO\u2093, PM\u2082.5 and CO\u2082 into premature deaths rely on population\u2011average exposure assumptions. They often assume that everyone in a region breathes the same polluted air, even though modern stack heights, scrubbers, and dispersion modeling dramatically reduce ground\u2011level concentrations.\n* **Attribution factors** are typically derived from worst\u2011case scenarios in heavily polluted megacities, then applied uniformly to coal plants worldwide. This \u201cone\u2011size\u2011fits\u2011all\u201d approach inflates the death toll attributed to any single facility.\n* **Temporal averaging** ignores that many coal plants operate intermittently or are retired early, so the cumulative exposure over a plant\u2019s lifetime is far lower than the models suggest.\n\n### 2.\u202fModern Coal Technology Cuts Emissions Drastically\n* **Ultra\u2011Supercritical (USC) boilers** operate at temperatures above 600\u202f\u00b0C and pressures over 250\u202fbar, achieving efficiencies of 45\u202f%\u201350\u202f%. Higher efficiency means less coal burned per MWh, which directly reduces pollutant output.\n* **Flue\u2011gas desulfurization (FGD)** and **selective catalytic reduction (SCR)** systems now remove >95\u202f% of SO\u2082 and >90\u202f% of NO\u2093 from the stack. When these controls are in place, the residual health impact drops to a fraction of the \u201clegacy\u2011plant\u201d estimates.\n* **Particulate controls** (electrostatic precipitators and fabric filters) capture >99\u202f% of PM\u2082.5, eliminating the bulk of the respiratory\u2011risk particles that drive the epidemiological death estimates.\n\n### 3.\u202fNuclear\u2019s Hidden Mortality Is Systematically Excluded\n* **Occupational exposure**: Workers at uranium mines, enrichment facilities,",

The mass of each pollutant per unit of energy is well\u2011characterised from plant\u2011monitoring data and from the U.S. EPA\u2019s **AP\u201142** emission factor database, the European **E\u2011MEP** database, and the IEA\u2019s **CO\u2082\u2011CO\u2082** emission inventories. |\n| **b. Model how those emissions travel and dilute in the atmosphere** | \u2022\u202fUse a global or regional chemical\u2011transport model (e.g., **GEOS\u2011Chem**, **WRF\u2011Chem**, **TM5**) to simulate dispersion, chemical transformation (SO\u2082 \u2192 sulfate aerosol), deposition, and residence time.<br>\u2022\u202fInputs: emission rates, meteorology, topography, land\u2011use. | The same amount of emissions can cause very different exposures depending on weather patterns and population density.  Transport models convert **emission tonnage** \u2192 **population\u2011weighted concentration** (\u00b5g\u202fm\u207b\u00b3) of the pollutants that people actually breathe. |\n| **c. Convert ambient concentration to health impact** | \u2022\u202fApply **concentration\u2011response functions (CRFs)** derived from large epidemiological cohort studies (e.g., the **Harvard Six Cities**, **American Cancer Society**, **Global Burden of Disease (GBD)**).<br>\u2022\u202fTypical CRF for PM\u2082.\u2085: a 10\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u207b\u00b3 increase in annual average PM\u2082.\u2085 raises all\u2011cause mortality by \u22486\u20118\u202f% (meta\u2011analysis of >30 studies).<br>\u2022\u202fFor SO\u2082, NO\u2093, and Hg, additional CRFs are used (often smaller). | The CRFs translate **exposure** (\u00b5g\u202fm\u207b\u00b3) into **additional deaths** per year.  Because the relationship is roughly linear at the low\u2011to\u2011moderate concentrations typical of most of the world, the total deaths scale almost directly with total emitted mass. |\n| **d. Integrate over time and space** | \u2022\u202fSum the annual excess deaths over the entire population that is exposed to the plume.<br>\u2022\u202fDivide by the total electricity generated (TWh) to get **deaths\u202f/\u202fTWh**. | This step produces the final figure that appears in most comparative tables (e.g., ~24\u202fdeaths/TWh for coal).  The integration is usually performed for a **full plant lifetime** (\u224840\u202fyr) and sometimes extrapolated to a 100\u2011year horizon to capture long\u2011lived pollutants like black carbon. |\n\n### Key quantitative take\u2011aways\n\n| Pollutant | Typical emissions per 1\u202fTWh of coal electricity* | Resulting excess deaths (average) |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **PM\u2082.\u2085** (primary + secondary) | 0.5\u20111\u202ftonne (primary) \u2192 ~2\u20114\u202ftonnes of ambient PM\u2082.\u2085 after atmospheric chemistry | 12\u201118\u202fdeaths |\n| **SO\u2082 \u2192 sulfate** | 5\u201110\u202ftonnes \u2192 ~10\u201115\u202ftonnes of sulfate aerosol | 5\u20118\u202fdeaths |\n| **NO\u2093 \u2192 nitrate** | 2\u20114\u202ftonnes \u2192 ~3\u20115\u202ftonnes of nitrate aerosol | 1\u20112\u202fdeaths |\n| **Mercury (elemental)** | 0.02\u20110.04\u202ftonne \u2192 ~0.1\u202ftonne of atmospheric Hg (largely deposited as methyl\u2011Hg) | <1\u202fdeath (neuro\u2011development effects",
