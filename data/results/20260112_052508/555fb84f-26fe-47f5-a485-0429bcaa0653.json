Quick take\u2011away\n* **The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)** classifies **processed meat** as *carcinogenic to humans* (Group\u202f1) and **unprocessed/red meat** as *probably carcinogenic* (Group\u202f2A).  \n* The strongest and most consistent association is with **colore\u2011rectal cancer**; modest\u2011to\u2011moderate links have also been reported for pancreatic and prostate cancer.  \n* The evidence is **observational** (cohort, case\u2011control, meta\u2011analyses). Randomised trials are scarce, so causality cannot be proven with the same certainty as for smoking or asbestos.  \n* Risk appears **dose\u2011dependent**: most meta\u2011analyses estimate a \u223c12\u202f% higher relative risk of colorectal cancer for each additional 100\u202fg of cooked red meat per day.  \n* **Processed meats** (e.g., bacon, sausage, ham, deli slices) carry a higher risk (\u224820\u202f% increase per 50\u202fg/day) than unprocessed red meat.  \n* Cooking methods that generate **heterocyclic amines (HCAs)** and **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)** (high\u2011temperature grilling, pan\u2011frying, char\u2011broiling) add to the risk.  \n* **Heme iron**, nitrites/nitrates, and the formation of N\u2011nitroso compounds are the main biologically plausible mechanisms.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.

The **heme\u2011iron content** is similar across cuts, so the main cancer\u2011relevant benefit of lean cuts is the reduced amount of *added* saturated fat and fewer calories, which indirectly reduces obesity\u2011related cancer risk. |\n| **Pork**   | \u2022 **Pork tenderloin** (trimmed) <br>\u2022 **Pork loin chop** (center cut, trimmed) <br>\u2022 **Pork sirloin roast** | 85\u202fg cooked | Same logic as beef; pork tends to have slightly less heme\u2011iron than beef, so the absolute exposure is a little lower. |\n| **Lamb**   | \u2022 **Lamb leg, trimmed** (outside or inside) <br>\u2022 **Lamb loin chop** (lean portion) | 85\u202fg cooked | Lamb is naturally higher in saturated fat; trimming visible fat brings it down to the \u2264\u202f10\u202fg/100\u202fg range. |\n\n**How to verify \u201clean\u201d on a label (U.S./EU)**  \n* **U.S. USDA**: \u201cSelect\u201d or \u201cChoice\u201d grades with \u201c<\u202f10\u202fg total fat per 100\u202fg\u201d are considered lean. The Nutrition Facts panel will list \u201cTotal fat\u201d \u2013 aim for \u2264\u202f10\u202fg/100\u202fg.  \n* **EU**: Look for the **EU nutrition declaration**; \u201cfat \u2264\u202f10\u202fg/100\u202fg\u201d is the legal definition of \u201clean meat\u201d.\n\n**Portion\u2011size tip** \u2013 Most prospective studies (e.g., EPIC, Nurses\u2019 Health Study) treat **100\u202fg of cooked red meat** as the reference unit for risk calculations. Keeping portions at **\u2264\u202f85\u202fg (\u2248\u202f3\u202foz) per meal** and limiting total weekly intake to **\u2264\u202f500\u202fg cooked** (\u2248\u202f350\u202fg raw) keeps you under the \u201cmoderate\u2011consumption\u201d range where the relative risk increase is modest (\u2248\u202f5\u20138\u202f% for colorectal cancer).\n\n---\n\n## 2.
