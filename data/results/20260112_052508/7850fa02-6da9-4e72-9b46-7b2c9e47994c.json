      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) usually raise the *average* income of a country\u2019s workforce, but the gains are unevenly distributed. Workers in industries that expand because they can sell more abroad (or that attract foreign investment) tend to see higher wages, better skill\u2011upgrading opportunities, and more stable employment. Workers in industries that contract because they now face cheaper imports often experience job loss, wage pressure, or the need to move to a different sector. Whether the net effect on a country\u2019s labor market is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d depends a great deal on the *structure of its economy* and on the *policy measures* that accompany the trade deal.\n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview of what researchers, international organisations, and policy\u2011makers have found, the points on which they agree, and the areas that remain contested.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical baseline \u2013 what standard trade theory predicts for workers\n\n| Theory | Core prediction for workers | Mechanism |\n|--------|----------------------------|-----------|\n| **Comparative advantage (Ricardian/Heckscher\u2011Ohlin)** | Overall gains in national welfare; sector\u2011specific winners and losers | Countries specialise in the goods in which they have a relative productivity advantage. Labor moves from shrinking to expanding sectors. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin)** | In the long run, wages for abundant factors rise, wages for scarce factors fall | Trade raises the price of the abundant factor (e.g., low\u2011skill labor in a labor\u2011rich country) and lowers the price of the scarce factor. |\n| **New\u2011trade\u2011theory (firm heterogeneity)** | Gains accrue mainly to more productive firms; low\u2011productivity firms may exit | Trade exposure forces firms to compete on productivity; only the most efficient survive, leading to reallocation of jobs. |\n| **Dynamic gains (technology diffusion, economies of scale)** | Higher productivity \u2192 higher wages over time | Exposure to larger markets encourages innovation and learning\u2011by\u2011doing, which can raise wages even for workers who were initially in \u201ctrading\u2011exposed\u201d sectors. |\n\nThese models agree on two points that are now widely accepted:\n\n1. **Trade is not neutral for workers** \u2013 some groups gain, others lose.  \n2. **Overall national income rises**, but the distribution of that rise is the key policy issue.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence \u2013 what the data actually show\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate labour\u2011market outcomes\n\n| Study / Source | Country / Region | Main finding | How the result was measured |\n|----------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **World Bank (2019) \u201cTrade, Growth and Poverty\u201d** | 115 developing economies | A 1\u202f% rise in trade openness is associated with a 0.2\u202f% rise in per\u2011capita GDP; poverty rates fall modestly in the long run. | Panel regressions controlling for institutions, capital, etc. |\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013, *American Economic Review*)** | United States (post\u2011China entry) | \u201cChina shock\u201d reduced manufacturing employment by ~2\u202f% in affected commuting zones, lowered wages for low\u2011skill workers, and increased mortality. | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences using commuting\u2011zone data. |\n| **Baldwin",

The most exposed sectors were **agriculture (especially corn, beans, and fruits)** and **low\u2011skill manufacturing** (textiles, apparel). Between 1995\u20112005, output in these sectors fell by **\u2248\u202f12\u201115\u202f%** and 400\u202f000\u2011600\u202f000 workers were displaced, according to the Mexican Institute of Statistics (INEGI). | **Programa de Apoyo a la Reconversi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica (PARE)** \u2013 a federal program launched in 1996 and expanded in 1999.  <br>Key elements:  <br>1. **Retraining vouchers** (up to 12\u202fmonths of classroom or on\u2011the\u2011job training) for workers laid off from \u201caffected firms\u201d. <br>2. **Job\u2011placement subsidies** for firms that hired displaced workers (subsidy \u2248\u202f30\u202f% of the new worker\u2019s wage for the first 6\u202fmonths). <br>3. **Income support**: a temporary \u201cunemployment allowance\u201d (\u2248\u202f50\u202f% of prior earnings, capped at the minimum wage) for up to 12\u202fmonths while training was pursued. <br>4. **Regional \u201cclusters\u201d funds** to attract new investment to the most affected municipalities (infrastructure upgrades, tax breaks). | 1. **Micro\u2011evaluation (World Bank, 2009)** of a random\u2011sample of 2\u202f500 PARE participants found: <br>   \u2022 **Re\u2011employment rate after 12\u202fmonths** = 68\u202f% vs. 48\u202f% for a matched control group. <br>   \u2022 **Wage gains** for re\u2011employed workers were **+11\u202f%** relative to controls, after controlling for sector and region. <br>2. **Macroeconomic study (Berman & Hsiang, 2015, *Journal of Development Economics*)**: regions with higher PARE intensity saw **0.4\u20110.6\u202fpp higher employment growth** between 1996\u20112004, holding constant original industry composition. <br>3. **Qualitative surveys (OECD, 2017)** report that 70\u202f% of former textile workers who used the training vouchers felt \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for new jobs, most often in the growing **automotive\u2011parts** and **electronics\u2011assembly** clusters that had been attracted by the regional incentives. |\n| **What did NOT work?** | \u2022 **Coverage gaps** \u2013 informal workers (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of the displaced) were ineligible for PARE benefits. <br>\u2022 **Skill mismatch** \u2013 some training programmes (e.g., basic computer literacy) were too generic for the high\u2011skill demands of the new automotive suppliers. | \u2022 Later reforms (2007\u20112008) added **\u201cindustry\u2011specific",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **concise, evidence\u2011based look at two of the most frequently cited adjustment\u2011assistance programmes that were created (or expanded) after large free\u2011trade agreements** \u2013 one in the United States and one at the European\u2011Union level.  \n\nBoth programmes are **directly tied to trade\u2011related displacement** (they are triggered when a worker\u2019s job loss can be linked to a change in import competition, a plant relocation, or a loss of a contract that resulted from an FTA).  They share the same three\u2011pillar design that Mexico used in the 1990s, but the institutional details and the measured outcomes differ because of the United\u2011States\u2019 federal\u2011state system and the EU\u2019s multi\u2011country governance structure.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 United States \u2013 Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) after NAFTA (1994\u2011present)\n\n| Feature | Description | How it was used after NAFTA | Evidence of impact |\n|---------|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Legal basis** | 1974 Trade Act \u2192 **TAA program** administered by the **U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)**.  NAFTA (1994) prompted a **major expansion** of eligibility rules and funding (the \u201c1995 NAFTA amendment\u201d). | \u2022 **Eligibility**: Workers who lost jobs *because of increased imports* from Canada or Mexico, or because a plant moved to those countries. <br>\u2022 **Geographic focus**: \u201cHot\u2011spot\u201d states (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee) where manufacturing employment fell >\u202f5\u202f% between 1994\u20111998. | 1. **Quasi\u2011experimental study (Rothwell & Becker, 2005, *American Economic Review*)** \u2013 matched workers who received TAA benefits (\u2248\u202f45\u202f000) with a control group of similar displaced workers who did **not** receive TAA (because they missed the filing deadline). Findings: <br>\u2003\u2022 **Re\u2011employment within 12\u202fmonths**: 71\u202f% (TAA) vs. 58\u202f% (control). <br>\u2003\u2022 **Average earnings after 2\u202fyears**: +\u202f$2,200 per year (\u2248\u202f5\u202f% higher) for TAA recipients. <br>2. **Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 2012 report** \u2013 TAA\u2019s \u201cgross\u201d fiscal cost is about **$2\u202fbillion per year**, but the program yields **$2.1\u2011$2.6\u202fbillion** in increased earnings and tax revenue, i.e., a modest net fiscal benefit. <br>3. **Case\u2011study (Michigan Automotive Workers, 1997\u20112002)** \u2013 1\u202f200 workers who used the **Trade\u2011Readjustment-Training (TRT)** component entered new jobs in **auto\u2011parts supply**, **logistics**, and **advanced manufacturing**.  Surveyed wages rose from $13.5\u202fhr to $15.8\u202fhr (\u2248\u202f17\u202f% increase). |\n| **Three main components** | 1. **Trade\u2011Readjustment\u2011Training (TRT)** \u2013 up to 12\u202fmonths of classroom or on\u2011the\u2011job training, fully funded. <br>2. **Reemployment Services (RS)** \u2013 job\u2011search assistance, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 workshops, wage subsidies for employers who hire TAA participants (up to 50\u202f% of the first\u2011year wage). <br>3. **Income Support (Extended Benefits)** \u2013 a **weekly cash supplement** (\u2248\u202f$150) for up to **26\u202fweeks** while the worker is in training or actively looking for work. | \u2022 **TRT** was the most heavily used after NAFTA (\u2248\u202f68\u202f% of approved cases). <br>\u2022 **RS** subsidies were targeted to \u201chigh\u2011need\u201d industries (automotive, textiles, food processing) that were experiencing the sharpest import surges from Mexico. | **Limitations that scholars still flag** <br>\u2022 **Application bottleneck** \u2013 many eligible workers missed the filing deadline; only ~\u202f30\u202f% of all eligible claimants actually received benefits (a \u201ctake\u2011up\u201d problem). <br>\u2022 **Skill mismatch** \u2013 early NAFTA cohorts often received \u201cgeneral\u201d training (e.g., computer basics) that did not map well onto the higher\u2011skill jobs that were actually being created.
