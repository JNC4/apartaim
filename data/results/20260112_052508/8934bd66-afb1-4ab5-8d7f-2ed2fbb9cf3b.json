Who tends to **gain**?\n\n| Group | Why they benefit | Typical evidence |\n|-------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **Home\u2011owners (especially recent buyers)** | Lower mortgage rates \u2192 cheaper financing; house\u2011price rise from portfolio\u2011balance effects. | U.S. studies (e.g., Bivens, 2015; Gagnon et\u202fal., 2011) find a 0.5\u20131\u202f% rise in house prices per 100\u2011basis\u2011point fall in 10\u2011year yields after QE. |\n| **Stock\u2011market investors** | Higher equity valuations as funds flow out of bonds. | Joyce, Lasaosa & Song (2011) estimate a 3\u20135\u202f% rise in the S&P\u202f500 for each 100\u2011bp drop in long\u2011term yields in the U.S. QE periods. |\n| **Corporate borrowers** | Cheaper corporate bond issuance and bank loans; higher market confidence. | Krishnamurthy & Vissing\u2011Jorgensen (2011) show a 10\u201315\u202f% increase in corporate bond issuance in the U.S. after QE announcements. |\n| **Export\u2011oriented",
      "truthbot_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a quick reminder**\n\n* QE is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets (usually government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities).  \n* The immediate balance\u2011sheet effect is to **raise the price and lower the yield of the assets bought**, which pushes down short\u2011term interest rates and, through a chain of market\u2011wide reactions, is intended to stimulate borrowing, investment, and ultimately real\u2011economy activity.  \n\nBecause the policy works through **financial\u2011market channels**, its side\u2011effects are felt unevenly across different groups.  Below is a synthesis of the **strongest empirical and theoretical evidence** on those distributional effects, together with a clear statement of where scholars and policymakers agree, where they dispute, and where the evidence is still thin.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels (the \u201chow\u201d)\n\n| Channel | What it does | Typical first\u2011order impact on groups |\n|---------|--------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | When the central bank removes safe assets (e.g., Treasuries) from the market, investors shift into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate). | \u2191 Asset prices \u2192 wealth gain for owners of stocks, bonds, housing; \u2193 yields \u2192 cheaper borrowing for firms and households with debt. |\n| **Lower\u2011rate channel** | QE pushes down yields on government bonds; the policy rate (or the \u201cshadow\u201d rate) falls, reducing borrowing costs across the economy. | Lower mortgage, auto\u2011loan, and corporate\u2011bond rates \u2192 borrowers (home\u2011buyers, firms) benefit; savers receive lower interest income. |\n| **Expectations / \u201csignalling\u201d channel** | By committing to keep rates low for an extended period, the central bank shapes expectations about future inflation and growth. | If expectations of higher inflation become credible, wages and prices may rise later, potentially helping low\u2011income workers; however, the timing is uncertain. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Lower domestic yields can (but does not always) depreciate the currency, making exports cheaper. | Export\u2011oriented firms and workers in tradable sectors gain; import\u2011dependent households may face higher import prices. |\n| **Liquidity / \u201cfinancial\u2011stability\u201d channel** | Large purchases improve market liquidity, reducing the risk of sudden credit crunches. | Banks and other financial intermediaries face lower funding stress; small\u2011business lenders may find credit easier to obtain. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011monetary interaction** | QE lowers the government\u2019s borrowing costs, leaving fiscal space for spending or tax cuts. | Taxpayers ultimately bear the cost (if debt is repaid later) while beneficiaries of any fiscal stimulus (often lower\u2011income groups) receive direct transfers. |\n\n> **Consensus point:**  All major central\u2011bank research (Fed, ECB, BoE, BoJ) and most academic surveys agree that *the portfolio\u2011rebalancing and lower\u2011rate channels are the dominant short\u2011run effects of QE*.
