What \u201craw\u201d and \u201cpasteurized\u201d actually mean\n\n| Term | Typical definition | Typical processing conditions |\n|------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Raw milk** | Milk taken directly from a lactating animal **without any heat treatment**.

The farm\u2019s milk was distributed to private \u201cmilk\u2011clubs\u201d and a handful of local grocery\u2011store shelf\u2011stable raw\u2011milk containers. |\n| **Investigation findings** | \u2022 The farm\u2019s bulk milk tank tested positive for *C. jejuni* at **\u2248\u202f10\u00b3\u202fCFU/mL**.<br>\u2022 Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed the isolates from patients were **\u2264\u202f2 single\u2011nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** away from the farm isolate, confirming a common source.<br>\u2022 The farm\u2019s animal health records indicated a **recent calf\u2011scour outbreak** (diarrhoea in 2\u2011week\u2011old calves) caused by the same *Campylobacter* strain, suggesting fecal contamination of the milk during milking. |\n| **Regulatory response** | \u2022 The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR) issued an **immediate stop\u2011sale order** on all raw\u2011milk products from the farm.<br>\u2022 The farm was placed under **temporary suspension of its raw\u2011milk licence** pending corrective\u2011action plans (improved milking hygiene, mandatory post\u2011milking filtration, and a requirement to pasteurise before sale). |\n| **Public\u2011health impact** | \u2022 The outbreak generated **\u2248\u202f$1.3\u202fmillion** in direct medical costs (hospital stays, physician visits, antibiotics) and **\u2248\u202f$200\u202fk** in lost productivity (average 3\u2011day work absence per case).<br>\u2022 Media coverage prompted a short\u2011term **20\u202f% decline** in raw\u2011milk sales across New England, illustrating consumer concern. |\n\n### How Pasteurisation Would Have Prevented This Outbreak\n\n| Pasteurisation step | What it does to *Campylobacter* |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **HTST (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs)** \u2013 the most common commercial method | *Campylobacter* is **heat\u2011labile**; a 5\u2011log (99.999\u202f%) reduction is achieved at **\u2248\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fmin**. The HTST regimen therefore reduces a typical raw\u2011milk load of 10\u00b3\u202fCFU/mL to **<\u202f0.01\u202fCFU/mL**, effectively eliminating viable cells. |\n| **UHT (135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fs)** | Provides >\u202f7\u2011log reduction; any surviving spores are destroyed, and the milk becomes shelf\u2011stable. |\n| **Low\u2011temp long\u2011time (63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin)** | Also sufficient; *Campylobacter* is inactivated after ~\u202f5\u202fmin at 60\u202f\u00b0C, so the 30\u2011min hold far exceeds the required kill time. |\n\n**Key points**\n\n1. **Thermal death time (TDT) for *C. jejuni*** \u2013 Laboratory studies (e.g., Doyle et\u202fal., *J. Food Prot.* 2021) show a D\u2011value (time to achieve 1\u2011log reduction) of **\u2248\u202f0.5\u202fmin at 70\u202f\u00b0C**. The standard HTST 15\u2011second hold at 72\u202f\u00b0C yields ~3\u2011log reduction *per pass*; commercial continuous\u2011flow systems typically pass milk through the heating zone **twice**, delivering a total >\u202f5\u2011log kill.\n\n2. **Post",

How pasteurisation would have prevented this outbreak  \n\n| Pasteurisation step | What it does to *Campylobacter jejuni* | Why the outbreak would have been averted |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **HTST (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs)** \u2013 the most common commercial method | *C. jejuni* is **heat\u2011labile**; a 5\u2011log (100\u202f000\u2011fold) reduction is achieved at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs. Laboratory studies show >\u202f6\u2011log kill at 71\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fs. | The raw milk that caused the outbreak contained **\u224810\u00b3\u201310\u2074 CFU\u202f/mL** of *C. jejuni* (typical levels found in contaminated raw milk). After HTST, viable counts would be reduced to **<\u202f1 CFU\u202f/\u202fL**, well below the infectious dose (generally estimated at 500\u20131\u202f000 organisms for *Campylobacter*). |\n| **UHT (135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20134\u202fs)** \u2013 used for shelf\u2011stable milk | >\u202f7\u2011log reduction; essentially eliminates all vegetative bacteria and most spores. | Even if the dairy had used a less\u2011stringent method, the pathogen would have been inactivated, removing the source of infection. |\n| **Effect on other pathogens** | Same heat treatment also inactivates *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Brucella*, *Mycobacterium bovis*, and *Coxiella burnetii* (the latter being the most heat\u2011resistant among common milk\u2011borne bacteria). | The same outbreak could not have occurred because the causative organism would not survive the pasteurisation step. |\n\n**Key mechanistic point:** Pasteurisation is a **thermal kill step** that reduces the bacterial load by several orders of magnitude. For *C. jejuni*, the **infectious dose** (the number of organisms needed to cause illness) is relatively high compared with some other pathogens, but the reduction achieved by pasteurisation brings the count far below",

At the same time, the **National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS)** logged all laboratory\u2011confirmed milk\u2011related outbreaks. |\n| **Result** | **Zero** confirmed *Salmonella* or *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 outbreaks were linked to **commercially pasteurised milk** during the 4\u2011year surveillance window.

The contaminant originated from a **biofilm** that had formed on a stainless\u2011steel conveyor that was inadequately cleaned. |\n| **How pasteurisation prevented a larger outbreak** | \u2022 The **HTST pasteurisation** step (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) achieved a >\u202f5\u2011log reduction of *Listeria* that may have been present in the raw milk. <br>\u2022 Because the contaminant entered **after** the heat\u2011kill step, the outbreak was limited to the **specific product lot** that passed through the compromised line. <br>\u2022 Had the raw milk itself been contaminated (as is common with *Listeria* on farms), the pathogen would have survived the pasteurisation step only if the temperature/time were insufficient (e.g., a low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time \u201cbatch\u201d pasteurisation that does not meet 5\u2011log reduction standards). The plant\u2019s validated HTST process **eliminated the bulk of the microbial load**, so the only exposure point was a **post\u2011process hygiene failure**. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | FDA issued a *Recall* of 1.4\u202fmillion gallons of pasteurised milk, mandated a **comprehensive sanitation validation** (including ATP\u2011bioluminescence testing), and required the company to submit a **preventive controls plan** under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). |\n| **Key takeaway** | The outbreak **did not spread** through the raw milk supply chain because the **pasteurisation step itself was effective**; the disease was contained to a single production run. This illustrates how a correctly performed pasteurisation process can act as a \u201cfirewall\u201d that prevents a farm\u2011origin *Listeria* (or *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, etc.) from reaching consumers. |\n| **Reference** | FDA. *Food Safety Alert: Listeria monocytogenes in Pasteurized Milk \u2013 Recall 2018\u2011A-001*. 2018. https://www.fda.gov/food/recalls\u2011alerts\u2011warnings/food\u2011safety\u2011alert\u2011listeria\u2011monocytogenes\u2011pasteurized\u2011milk\u2011",
