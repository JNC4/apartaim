The description includes the types of data that are generated, the methods used to interpret those data, and where the evidence is strongest or still debated.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The overall framework \u2013 \u201crisk assessment\u201d\n\nMost national and international bodies (e.g., the U.S.\u202fFood and Drug Administration\u202f(FDA), the European Food Safety Authority\u202f(EFSA), the World Health Organization\u202f(WHO), and the Food and Agriculture Organization\u202f(FAO)) follow the same **four\u2011step risk\u2011assessment paradigm** first formalised by the Codex Alimentarius (the WHO/FAO food\u2011safety standard\u2011setting body).\n\n| Step | Goal | Typical scientific activities |\n|------|------|------------------------------|\n| **1. Hazard identification** | Ask: *Does the new trait or the introduced DNA/protein have any intrinsic properties that could cause harm?* | \u2022 Bio\u2011informatic comparison of the new protein to known toxins or allergens (e.g., using the AllergenOnline database).<br>\u2022 In\u2011vitro assays (e.g., cell\u2011culture cytotoxicity, enzyme\u2011inhibition tests). |\n| **2. Hazard characterisation (dose\u2011response)** | Determine the relationship between exposure level and any adverse effect. | \u2022 Acute and sub\u2011chronic animal feeding studies (usually 90\u2011day rodent studies).<br>\u2022 Determination of No\u2011Observed\u2011Adverse\u2011Effect Level (NOAEL). |\n| **3. Exposure assessment** | Estimate how much of the GM food (and the new protein) people actually eat. | \u2022 Food\u2011consumption surveys (e.g., NHANES in the U.S.).<br>\u2022 Measurement of protein expression levels in the edible tissue. |\n| **4. Risk characterisation** | Combine hazard and exposure information to decide whether the risk is acceptable. | \u2022 Margin\u2011of\u2011exposure (MOE) calculations (NOAEL \u00f7 estimated intake).<br>\u2022 Comparison with established safety thresholds (often a 100\u2011fold safety factor). |\n\nIf the calculated risk is below the regulatory threshold, the product is considered **safe for its intended use**.  The process is iterative: new data (e.g., from post\u2011market monitoring) can trigger a re\u2011assessment.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Core scientific data that are generated\n\n### 2.1 Molecular characterisation of the transgene  \n\n| What is examined | Why it matters | Typical methods |\n|------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **DNA insertion site(s)** | To ensure there are no unintended disruptions of native genes (which could create new allergens or toxins). | Southern blot, PCR, whole\u2011genome sequencing, *in silico* mapping. |\n| **Copy number** | Multiple copies can increase expression levels and raise the chance of gene\u2011silencing effects. | Quantitative PCR, droplet\u2011digital PCR. |\n| **Stability of the insert** | Verify that the inserted DNA remains unchanged after several generations. | Segregation analysis across generations, sequencing. |\n| **Expression level of the introduced protein** | Determines the dose of the novel protein that consumers would ingest. | ELISA, mass\u2011spectrometry, Western blot. |\n\n### 2.2 Comparative compositional analysis  \n\nThe principle of **substantial equivalence** (first articulated by the OECD in 1993) requires that a GM food be compared with its conventional counterpart for a set of nutrients, anti\u2011nutrients, and known toxins.\n\n* **What is measured?** Macro\u2011 and micronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals), secondary metabolites (e.g., glucosinolates in Brassica), and any known natural toxins (e.g., solanine in potatoes).  \n* **How",

In mature kernels the average concentration was **\u2248\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b5g\u202fg\u207b\u00b9 fresh weight** (range 0.05\u20110.15\u202f\u00b5g\u202fg\u207b\u00b9).<br>\u2022 Consumption data (US NHANES, EU EFSA surveys) showed that even high\u2011consumers of maize (\u2248\u202f150\u202fg\u202fday\u207b\u00b9) would ingest **\u2264\u202f15\u202f\u00b5g Cry1Ab per day**, far below the NOAEL derived from animal studies (see below). | The exposure estimate is orders of magnitude lower than the dose that caused any effect in the most sensitive animal model. |\n| **Animal feeding studies (hazard characterisation)** | **90\u2011day rodent study** (USA, 1995) \u2013 groups of rats fed diets containing 0\u202f%, 10\u202f% (\u2248\u202f30\u202fg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 diet), or 30\u202f% (\u2248\u202f90\u202fg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 diet) MON\u202f810 maize.
