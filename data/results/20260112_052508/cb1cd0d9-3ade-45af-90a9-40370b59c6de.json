      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurised milk \u2013 a safety overview**\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based comparison that brings together the main points that most public\u2011health agencies, scientific reviews, and food\u2011safety organisations agree on.  The goal is to show where the data are strong, where there is still debate, and what the practical implications are for a consumer.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cpasteurisation\u201d does\n\n| Process | Typical conditions | Main effect |\n|---------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Reduces most vegetative bacteria |\n| **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs | Standard in most supermarkets |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs | Gives shelf\u2011stable milk, kills essentially all microbes |\n\n**Result:**  A >5\u2011log (100\u202f000\u2011fold) reduction of *pathogenic* bacteria that are known to cause food\u2011borne illness (e.g., *Salmonella, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes, *Campylobacter jejuni*).  Spoilage organisms are also reduced, extending shelf life.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical microbial hazards in raw milk\n\n| Pathogen | Typical illness & severity | Frequency in outbreaks (U.S. 2000\u20112022) |\n|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| *Salmonella* spp. | Gastroenteritis, sometimes invasive disease | 28\u202f% of raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks |\n| *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 | Bloody diarrhea, HUS (kidney failure) \u2013 can be fatal | 22\u202f% |\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | Septicemia, meningitis; especially dangerous for pregnant women, newborns, elderly, immunocompromised | 13\u202f% |\n| *Campylobacter* spp. | Diarrhea, Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (rare) | 12\u202f% |\n| *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin) | Rapid vomiting, diarrhoea | 7\u202f% |\n| Others (e.g., *Brucella*, *Mycobacterium bovis*) | Rare in industrialized countries but can cause chronic disease | <5\u202f% |\n\n**Key point:**  Raw milk can contain any of these organisms if the herd is infected, the milking environment is contaminated, or the milk is stored at temperatures that allow bacterial growth.  Even a single contaminated batch can cause an outbreak because a typical serving (\u2248250\u202fmL) can contain >10\u2074 colony\u2011forming units (CFU) of a pathogen, well above the infectious dose for many of them.\n\n*Sources:* CDC \u201cFoodborne Outbreaks Associated with Raw Milk\u201d (2023); European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) \u201cScientific Opinion on Raw Milk Consumption\u201d (2021).\n\n---\n\n## 3. How often do illnesses actually occur?\n\n| Region | Estimated annual cases from raw milk (all ages) | Relative risk vs. pasteurised milk |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| United States | ~30\u201345 reported illnesses (\u22480.01\u202f% of total milk\u2011related cases) | \u2248150\u2011 to 200\u2011fold higher risk per litre consumed |\n| European Union (selected countries) | 2\u20138 outbreaks per year, \u224850\u2011100 cases total | 100\u2011300\u00d7 higher risk per litre |\n| Canada | 3\u20135 outbreaks per year (\u224820\u201130 cases) | Similar magnitude of excess risk |\n\n*Interpretation:*  The absolute number of illnesses is small compared with the total population, but the **risk per litre** of raw milk is dramatically higher because the denominator (total raw\u2011milk consumption) is tiny (\u22480.5\u202f% of total milk sold in most high\u2011income",

The herd was small (\u224830 cows) and the farm marketed the milk as \u201call\u2011natural\u201d and \u201cfarm\u2011fresh.\u201d | Small\u2011scale operations are often the source of raw\u2011milk outbreaks because they lack the built\u2011in redundancies (large\u2011scale testing, automated cooling, HACCP plans) that larger pasteurised\u2011milk plants must follow under federal law. |\n| **The pathogen** | *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, a Shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing strain that can cause severe gastrointestinal illness, haemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS), and kidney failure. The infectious dose can be as low as **10\u2013100 organisms**. | This strain is *not* destroyed by refrigeration; it survives in raw milk unless the milk is heat\u2011treated. |\n| **How the outbreak was detected** | - **Week\u202f1 (early July 2012):** The Pennsylvania Department of Health received reports of three children (ages 2\u20135) with bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. <br>- **Week\u202f2:** All three tested positive for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7. <br>- **Epidemiologic interview:** All had visited the same farm and drunk its raw milk within the previous 5\u202fdays. | Prompt laboratory confirmation and a clear common exposure (raw milk from the same farm) made the source traceable. |\n| **Investigation steps** | 1. **Environmental sampling** \u2013 Swabs from bulk\u2011tank, milking equipment, and cow teats were taken. <br>2. **Cow testing** \u2013 Fecal samples from all lactating cows were cultured; two cows tested positive for O157:H7. <br>3. **Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS)** \u2013 The isolates from patients, milk, and the two cows were *identical* (\u22642 single\u2011nucleotide polymorphisms), confirming the transmission chain. <br>4. **Regulatory action** \u2013 The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture issued an **immediate \u201cstop\u2011sale\u201d order** for all raw milk from the farm; the farm voluntarily ceased raw\u2011milk sales and later closed. | WGS is now the gold\u2011standard for outbreak source attribution; it gave a *definitive* link between the pathogen in the cows, the milk, and the sick people. |\n| **Human impact** | \u2022 **Total cases:** 12 confirmed patients (8 children, 4 adults). <br>\u2022 **Hospitalisations:** 5 (including 2 children who developed HUS). <br>\u2022 **Deaths:** 0, but two children required dialysis for several weeks. | Even a modest\u2011size outbreak can cause serious illness, especially in children whose kidneys are more vulnerable to Shiga toxin. |\n| **After\u2011effects & lessons learned** | - **Regulatory review:** Pennsylvania tightened its oversight of raw\u2011milk \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d agreements, requiring annual veterinary health certificates for all lactating cows and mandatory microbial testing of bulk\u2011tank milk (\u22655\u202fCFU\u202f/\u202fmL *E.\u202fcoli* as a trigger for corrective action). <br>- **Public\u2011health messaging:** CDC and state health agencies added a targeted \u201craw\u2011milk safety\u201d alert to their 2012 outbreak summary, citing the low infectious dose of O157:H7 and the inability of refrigeration to inactivate it. <br>- **Industry response:** Several dairy\u2011farm associations began offering *on\u2011site pasteurisation* kiosks to allow customers to purchase heat\u2011treated milk while still supporting the \u201cfarm\u2011fresh\u201d brand. | The outbreak shows how a single contaminated cow can turn an entire batch of raw milk into a vehicle for a severe pathogen, and how quickly the chain can be broken when robust traceability and modern genomics are in place. |\n| **Key take\u2011away for consumers** | \u2022 **Risk is real, not theoretical.** A single infected animal can contaminate a whole bulk\u2011",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How pasteurisation stops disease\u2011causing microbes in milk  \n\nPasteurisation is a **controlled heat\u2011treatment** that is calibrated to destroy the vegetative (growing) forms of the bacteria, viruses and parasites that most often cause food\u2011borne illness, while leaving the milk\u2019s nutritional and sensory qualities largely intact.  \nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step look at what the heat does at the cellular level, how the process is timed, and why it is effective against the pathogens that appear in raw\u2011milk outbreaks.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic physics \u2013 \u201cthermal death\u201d\n\n| Term | Meaning | Typical value for milk\u2011borne pathogens |\n|------|---------|----------------------------------------|\n| **D\u2011value** | Time (minutes) at a given temperature needed to achieve a 1\u2011log (10\u2011fold) reduction of a specific organism. | *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 at 71\u202f\u00b0C \u2248 0.1\u202fmin; *Listeria monocytogenes* at 71\u202f\u00b0C \u2248 0.2\u202fmin; *Campylobacter* at 71\u202f\u00b0C \u2248 0.05\u202fmin |\n| **Z\u2011value** | Temperature increase (\u00b0C) that reduces the D\u2011value by ten\u2011fold. | For most milk pathogens Z \u2248 5\u20137\u202f\u00b0C |\n| **Log\u2011reduction** | Number of ten\u2011fold reductions achieved. 5\u2011log = 100\u202f000\u2011fold; 6\u2011log = 1\u202f000\u202f000\u2011fold. | Regulatory targets: \u22655\u2011log for *C. jejuni* and *Salmonella*; \u22656\u2011log for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 and *Listeria* |\n\n**What the numbers mean:**  \nIf a pathogen has a D\u2011value of 0.1\u202fmin at 71\u202f\u00b0C, keeping the milk at that temperature for 0.5\u202fmin (30\u202fs) will give a 5\u2011log reduction (0.1\u202fmin\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f0.5\u202fmin). That is the principle behind the **high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurisation** standard of 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs: it exceeds the required log\u2011reduction for every listed pathogen.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the heat actually does to a microbial cell  \n\n| Biological target | Effect of 70\u201180\u202f\u00b0C heat for 15\u201330\u202fs |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Cell membrane / envelope** | Phospholipid bilayer becomes fluid and ruptures; loss of selective permeability \u2192 leakage of cytoplasmic contents. |\n| **Proteins (enzymes, structural proteins)** | Denaturation (unfolding) of tertiary structure; loss of catalytic activity; aggregation into insoluble clumps. |\n| **DNA & RNA** | Heat alone does not break the double helix, but denatured proteins that normally protect nucleic acids (e.g., DNA\u2011binding proteins) are inactivated, and the cell can no longer replicate. |\n| **Ribosomes** | Disassembly, preventing protein synthesis. |\n| **Spore coats** (for spore\u2011forming bacteria) | **Resistant** \u2013 the thick, dehydrated coat and dipicolinic acid protect the core; typical pasteurisation temperatures do **not** inactivate spores (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum* type\u202fE). |\n\nBecause most milk\u2011borne disease agents are **vegetative bacteria** (they are actively growing in the udder or on the farm environment), destroying their membranes and proteins is sufficient to kill them.  Viruses (e.g., rotavirus) are also inactivated because their protein capsids are denatured.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Standard pasteurisation regimes and the pathogens they target  \n\n| Regime (U.S./EU/FAO) | Temperature & time | Primary purpose (log\u2011kill) | Pathogens effectively eliminated |\n|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | \u22655\u2011log for *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter* | *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Salmonella",
