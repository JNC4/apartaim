      "unknown_model_response": "### How Childhood Vaccines Work  \n\n1. **Basic idea \u2013 \u201ctraining\u201d the immune system**  \n   - **Natural infection**: When a virus or bacterium invades, the immune system learns to recognize its unique proteins (antigens). It creates antibodies and memory cells that can fight the pathogen if it shows up again.  \n   - **Vaccination**: A vaccine gives the immune system a **safe, controlled exposure** to a piece of the pathogen (or a harmless version of it). The immune system mounts a response and creates the same kind of memory without the person having to suffer the disease and its complications.  \n\n2. **Types of vaccines used in children**  \n\n| Vaccine type | What it contains | How it works | Typical examples in the childhood schedule |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Live\u2011attenuated** | Weakened but still living microbes | Replicate a little, stimulating a strong, long\u2011lasting response (often with one dose) | Measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR), varicella (chickenpox), rotavirus, oral polio (in some countries) |\n| **Inactivated (killed)** | Whole microbe that has been killed | Can\u2019t replicate; the immune system sees the antigens and makes a response, usually needs multiple doses | Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), hepatitis A, rabies (if given to children) |\n| **Subunit / protein\u2011based** | Only specific proteins or sugars from the pathogen (e.g., capsular polysaccharide, surface protein) | Focuses the immune response on the most protective parts; very safe because no whole organism | DTaP (diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb), hepatitis\u202fB, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV) |\n| **Toxoid** | Inactivated toxin produced by the bacteria | Immune system learns to neutralize the toxin rather than the bacterium itself | DTaP (diphtheria & tetanus toxoids) |\n| **mRNA** (newer) | Messenger RNA that instructs cells to make a harmless piece of the pathogen\u2019s spike protein | Cells produce the protein, the immune system recognizes it and builds immunity; does not contain live virus | COVID\u201119 vaccines (e.g., Pfizer\u2011BioNTech, Moderna) now approved for children \u22656\u202fmonths in many countries |\n| **Viral vector** | A harmless virus (often adenovirus) engineered to carry a gene for a pathogen protein | The vector delivers the gene; host cells make the protein, prompting immunity | Some COVID\u201119 vaccines (e.g., Janssen, AstraZeneca) \u2013 not yet part of routine U.S. childhood schedule but used in some regions |\n\n3. **How immunity is measured**  \n   - **Antibody titers**: Blood tests can quantify the amount of specific antibodies produced after vaccination.  \n   - **Cell\u2011mediated immunity**: T\u2011cell responses are also important, especially for live\u2011attenuated vaccines, but they are harder to measure routinely.  \n   - **Correlates of protection**: For many vaccines, a certain antibody level is known to predict protection; for others (e.g., pertussis), the relationship is less precise, which is why booster doses are recommended.\n\n---\n\n### Main Benefits of Childhood Vaccination  \n\n| Category | What it means for an individual child | What it means for the community (population level) |\n|----------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Prevention of disease** | Drastically lowers the chance of getting the targeted infection (often >90\u202f% efficacy after the full series). | Fewer cases overall \u2192 less strain on health\u2011care systems, fewer school absences, lower mortality. |\n| **Prevention of severe complications** | Many vaccine\u2011preventable diseases can cause pneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis, permanent organ damage, or death. Vaccines stop those outcomes. | Reduces the burden of long\u2011term disability (e.g., hearing loss from meningitis, limb loss from polio). |\n| **Herd immunity** | Even children who can\u2019t be vaccinated (e.g., due to severe immunodeficiency, certain allergies) are protected when enough others are immune. | Outbreaks become rare; the community can eliminate diseases (e.g., measles eliminated in many high\u2011coverage regions). |\n| **Economic benefits** | Fewer doctor visits, hospitalizations, and medications; parents",
