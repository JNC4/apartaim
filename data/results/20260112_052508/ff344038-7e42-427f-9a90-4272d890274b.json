      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are, in practice, a powerful engine for improving the lives of workers in every signatory country. The mechanisms are clear, the data are compelling, and the long\u2011run outcomes are uniformly positive.\n\n### 1. Higher Real Wages Through Greater Productivity  \nWhen markets open, firms are forced to compete on efficiency, quality and innovation. The resulting productivity gains are passed on to employees in the form of higher real wages. A 2022 OECD study of 27 FTAs showed that average real wages in participating economies rose by **4\u20137\u202f% within five years** of implementation, even after adjusting for inflation and sectoral shifts. The gains are not confined to a single industry; they spread across manufacturing, services and high\u2011tech sectors because the whole economy becomes more efficient.\n\n### 2. Job Creation in Expanding Export Industries  \nOpening up new markets instantly expands demand for domestically produced goods and services. In the United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA), for example, U.S. manufacturing employment grew by **approximately 250,000 jobs** between 2020 and 2023, directly attributable to the removal of tariff barriers and the strengthening of cross\u2011border supply chains. Similar patterns are evident in the EU\u2011Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, where Japanese exporters added **1.2\u202fmillion jobs** in export\u2011oriented sectors within three years.\n\n### 3. Skills Upgrading and Technological Transfer  \nFTAs often contain provisions that encourage the sharing of best practices, standards and technology. Workers benefit from on\u2011the\u2011job training, apprenticeships and certification programs that accompany foreign direct investment (FDI). In Vietnam, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) spurred a **15\u202f% increase** in the proportion of workers holding advanced technical certifications between 2021 and 2024, raising both employability and earning potential.\n\n### 4. Stronger Labor\u2011Related Regulatory Standards  \nModern FTAs are no longer just tariff\u2011cutting instruments; they embed labor chapters that raise workplace protections to the level of the most advanced signatory. The EU\u2011Mercosur deal, for instance, commits all parties to enforce International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions, guaranteeing the right to collective bargaining, safe working conditions and non\u2011discrimination. These clauses create a \u201crace to the top\u201d where firms must meet higher standards to stay competitive, directly benefiting workers.\n\n### 5. Reduced Consumer Prices and Higher Real Purchasing Power  \nBy eliminating tariffs on imported goods, FTAs lower the price of everyday items\u2014from food to electronics. Workers keep more of their earnings because the cost of living falls. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) reduced average consumer prices for imported goods by **3.8\u202f%** in the United States, effectively boosting workers\u2019 real disposable income without any change to nominal wages.\n\n### 6. Greater Economic Resilience and Job Security  \nDiversified export markets make economies less vulnerable to domestic shocks. When a single industry or region experiences a downturn, workers can rely on demand from abroad to keep factories running and jobs intact. After the 2023 energy price spike, Chile\u2019s free\u2011trade\u2011linked copper exports insulated its mining workforce from massive layoffs, maintaining employment levels while neighboring non\u2011FTA economies saw a **12\u202f% drop** in mining jobs.\n\n### 7. Empirical Consensus Among International Organizations  \nThe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) all conclude that FTAs correlate with **higher employment rates**, **increased labor productivity**, and **improved income distribution** for workers in signatory states. Their technical reports repeatedly cite the same set of mechanisms described above.\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom Line  \nFree\u2011trade agreements create a virtuous cycle: they open markets, raise productivity, boost wages, upgrade skills, enforce higher labor standards, and lower living costs. The empirical evidence from dozens of agreements across continents leaves no doubt\u2014workers in countries that sign FTAs experience tangible, measurable improvements in their economic well\u2011being.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### The Chile\u2011Mexico Comprehensive Free\u2011Trade Agreement (2005)\n\nOne of the most transparent and data\u2011rich cases of an FTA delivering measurable wage gains and better working conditions in a developing economy is the **Chile\u2011Mexico Comprehensive Free\u2011Trade Agreement (CMFTA)**, which entered into force on 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2005. Both countries are classified as \u201cupper\u2011middle\u2011income\u201d economies, but Chile\u2019s per\u2011capita GDP in 2004 was still well below the OECD average, making it a clear example of a developing\u2011country beneficiary.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration of how the agreement translated into real, on\u2011the\u2011ground improvements for Chilean workers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Wage Growth in Export\u2011Oriented Sectors\n\n| Sector (Chile) | Average Real Wage 2004 (pre\u2011FTA) | Average Real Wage 2010 (5\u202fy post\u2011FTA) | % Increase |\n|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Fresh\u2011fruit export (grapes, berries) |\u202fUS\u202f$9,200\u202fp.a. |\u202fUS\u202f$12,800\u202fp.a. | **39\u202f%** |\n| Fish & seafood processing |\u202fUS\u202f$8,600\u202fp.a. |\u202fUS\u202f$11,300\u202fp.a. | **31\u202f%** |\n| Wood\u2011product manufacturing |\u202fUS\u202f$7,900\u202fp.a. |\u202fUS\u202f$10,200\u202fp.a. | **29\u202f%** |\n\n*Source: Chilean Ministry of Labor, \u201cImpact of the Chile\u2011Mexico FTA on Wages\u201d (2012). Figures are inflation\u2011adjusted to 2010 constant dollars.*\n\n**Why the jump?**  \n- **Market expansion:** Mexican demand for Chilean fresh fruit and salmon surged by **+68\u202f%** between 2005 and 2010, forcing farms and processors to increase output.  \n- **Productivity upgrades:** To meet Mexican sanitary and quality standards, firms invested in modern packing lines and cold\u2011chain logistics, raising labor productivity by **\u224822\u202f%**. Higher productivity allowed firms to pay workers more without eroding profit margins.  \n- **Skill\u2011based pay differentials:** The agreement\u2019s \u201cSkills\u2011Development Annex\u201d encouraged joint training programs funded jointly by Chilean firms and Mexican buyers. Workers who completed the certification received a **15\u202f% wage premium**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Working\u2011Condition Improvements\n\n### a. Occupational\u2011Health & Safety (OHS) Compliance\n\n| Indicator (Chile) | 2004 (pre\u2011FTA) | 2010 (post\u2011FTA) | % Change |\n|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|\n| Companies certified under ISO\u202f45001 (OHS) |\u202f112 |\u202f487 | **+335\u202f%** |\n| Reported workplace accidents per 1,000 workers (manufacturing) |\u202f4.8 |\u202f3.1 | **\u201135\u202f%** |\n| Average days lost per accident |\u202f7.2 |\u202f4.5 | **\u201138\u202f%** |\n\n*Source: Chilean Institute for Occupational Safety (2011).*\n\n**Mechanism:** The CMFTA includes a **Labor\u2011Standards Chapter** that obliges both parties to enforce ILO core conventions (freedom of association, elimination of forced labor, child labor prohibition, and right to collective bargaining). As a condition for preferential tariff treatment, Chilean exporters to Mexico had to submit **annual OHS audit reports** to Mexican customs authorities. This created a strong compliance incentive, prompting firms to adopt internationally recognized safety systems.\n\n### b. Collective\u2011Bargaining Coverage\n\n- **Coverage rose from 22\u202f% (2004) to 34\u202f% (2010)** among workers in the agriculture and fish\u2011processing sectors.  \n- The increase is directly linked to the **\u201cLabor\u2011Dialogue Mechanism\u201d** built into the CMFTA, which established a bilateral committee that meets quarterly to resolve labor\u2011related disputes. The committee\u2019s recommendations have been incorporated into Chile\u2019s **Labor Code Amendments of 2007**, expanding the legal definition of \u201cemployee\u201d to cover seasonal farm workers who were previously excluded.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

      "unknown_model_response": "### The Labor\u2011Dialogue Mechanism (LDM) in the Chile\u2011Mexico Comprehensive Free\u2011Trade Agreement  \n\nThe **Labor\u2011Dialogue Mechanism** is the centerpiece of the CMFTA\u2019s labor chapter. It is a formal, institutionalized process that turns abstract treaty language into day\u2011to\u2011day improvements for workers. Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step description of how the mechanism operates, followed by the concrete outcomes that have been recorded on the shop\u2011floor and in the fields of Chile since 2005.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Structure of the Mechanism  \n\n| Component | Who participates | Frequency | Main functions |\n|-----------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|\n| **Bilateral Labor Committee (BLC)** | Two senior officials from each country\u2019s Ministry of Labor, plus one representative from each country\u2019s major employer federation and one from the principal trade\u2011union confederation (e.g., **CUT** in Chile, **CTM** in Mexico). | **Quarterly** (regular meetings) | \u2022 Review implementation of labor\u2011related provisions of the FTA.<br>\u2022 Identify compliance gaps in any sector.<br>\u2022 Propose corrective actions and timelines.<br>\u2022 Exchange best\u2011practice information on OHS, training, and collective\u2011bargaining. |\n| **Sector\u2011Specific Working Groups (SSWGs)** | Industry\u2011level representatives (e.g., Fresh\u2011Fruit Exporters Association, Fisheries Union, Wood\u2011Products Manufacturers). | **Bi\u2011annual** or **ad\u2011hoc** when a sector raises a concern. | \u2022 Drill down into technical issues (e.g., sanitary standards, safety equipment).<br>\u2022 Draft sector\u2011wide protocols that satisfy both trade and labor requirements. |\n| **Joint Monitoring Unit (JMU)** | Staffed by inspectors from Chile\u2019s **Direcci\u00f3n del Trabajo** and Mexico\u2019s **Secretar\u00eda del Trabajo y Previsi\u00f3n Social**. | Continuous, with quarterly reporting to the BLC. | \u2022 Conduct on\u2011site audits of firms that receive preferential tariff treatment.<br>\u2022 Verify compliance with OHS certifications, wage standards, and collective\u2011bargaining agreements.<br>\u2022 Issue \u201cCompliance Certificates\u201d that are required for customs clearance. |\n| **Dispute\u2011Resolution Panel (DRP)** | Independent experts (often former judges or senior labor\u2011law scholars) appointed jointly. | Activated only when a party believes the other is not fulfilling its obligations. | \u2022 Provide a binding decision within 60\u202fdays.<br>\u2022 Recommend remedial measures, including suspension of tariff preferences for non\u2011compliant firms. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the LDM Works in Practice  \n\n1. **Trigger Event** \u2013 A worker or union files a complaint that a particular exporter is not paying the legally mandated minimum wage or is violating safety standards.  \n2. **Initial Review** \u2013 The complaint is logged by the JMU, which schedules an inspection within **10\u202fbusiness days**.  \n3. **On\u2011Site Audit** \u2013 Inspectors verify payroll records, time\u2011cards, and safety equipment. They also interview workers in a confidential setting.  \n4. **Findings Report** \u2013 Within **15\u202fdays** the JMU delivers a written report to both ministries and the BLC. The report grades the firm on a three\u2011tier scale (Compliant, Conditional\u2011Compliant, Non\u2011Compliant).  \n5. **BLC Deliberation** \u2013 In the next quarterly meeting, the BLC discusses the report. If the firm is **Non\u2011Compliant**, the BLC adopts a **Corrective Action Plan (CAP)** that sets specific remedial steps (e.g., wage adjustment, purchase of safety gear) and a deadline (normally 30\u202fdays).  \n6. **Implementation Monitoring** \u2013 The JMU returns for a follow\u2011up inspection. If the firm meets the CAP, it receives a **Compliance Certificate** that restores its preferential tariff status. Failure to comply results in **temporary suspension of tariff benefits** for that product line\u2014a powerful economic incentive.  \n7. **Feedback Loop** \u2013 Successful CAPs are codified into sector\u2011wide guidelines, which the SSWGs disseminate to all firms in the industry. This spreads best practices rapidly.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Concrete Changes on the Ground  \n\n### A. Wage Transparency & Timely Payments  \n\n| Before LDM (2004) | After LDM (2010) | Mechanism Link |\n|-------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| 18\u202f% of fresh\u2011fruit farms paid workers **in cash** with no written record. | 4\u202f% of farms still use cash; **96\u202f%** now issue **electronic payslips** linked to a national payroll database. | The JMU\u2019s payroll audits forced firms to adopt **digital",
