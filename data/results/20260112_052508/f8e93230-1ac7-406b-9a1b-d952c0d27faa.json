      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) in a nutshell**\n\nQE is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank buys large amounts of financial assets (usually government bonds and, in later rounds, corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities).  \nThe purchases have three immediate mechanical effects:\n\n| Mechanism | What the central bank does | Immediate market outcome |\n|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Takes safe assets out of the hands of banks, pension funds, insurers, etc. | Those institutions sell the assets they receive for other securities (stocks, corporates, real\u2011estate, high\u2011yield bonds). Prices rise, yields fall. |\n| **Liquidity & credit easing** | Increases reserves in the banking system and, when corporate\u2011bond purchases are included, signals willingness to buy riskier debt. | Banks find it cheaper to lend; risk premia on non\u2011government debt shrink. |\n| **Expectations channel** | Publicly announces that \u201cinterest rates will stay low for a long time.\u201d | Reduces long\u2011run inflation expectations and the term premium on bonds, further lowering borrowing costs. |\n\nBecause the policy works through *prices* of assets and *costs* of borrowing, its distributional consequences fall largely along the lines of who **owns** assets versus who **needs** credit. Below is a synthesis of the main findings from the academic literature, central\u2011bank research, and real\u2011world experience (U.S. Fed QE 2008\u20112014, ECB\u2019s PSPP 2015\u20112020, BOJ\u2019s massive QE 2013\u2011present, UK\u2019s QE 2009\u20112022).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Households  \n\n| Group | How QE tends to affect them | Evidence / caveats |\n|-------|----------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Asset\u2011holding households (especially the wealthy)** | \u2022 Higher prices of equities, corporate bonds, REITs, and sometimes housing \u2192 *wealth effect*.<br>\u2022 Lower yields on safe assets (government bonds, savings accounts) reduce returns on cash and pension\u2011fund savings. | Studies (e.g., Bivens, 2015; Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens, & Tong, 2011) find that the bulk of QE\u2011induced stock\u2011price gains accrue to the top 10\u201320\u202f% of income earners, who own most equities. The \u201cwealth gap\u201d effect is robust across the U.S., Eurozone and Japan. |\n| **Borrowing households (middle\u2011 and low\u2011income)** | \u2022 Mortgage rates fall (especially when QE includes MBS purchases). \u2192 cheaper home loans, higher chance of buying a house.<br>\u2022 Consumer\u2011credit rates (auto loans, credit\u2011cards) also tend to drop, easing debt service. | The Fed\u2019s \u201cHousing Finance\u201d reports show a 0.5\u20111\u202fpercentage\u2011point decline in 30\u2011yr mortgage rates per $1\u202ftrillion of QE, translating into modest increases in home\u2011ownership probability for credit\u2011worthy borrowers. |\n| **Non\u2011borrowing, low\u2011wealth households** | \u2022 Little direct benefit from rising asset prices because they hold few marketable assets.<br>\u2022 May experience *lower* real returns on cash savings if inflation eventually picks up. | Survey\u2011based work (e.g., Greenwood, Hanson & Li, 2020) finds that QE\u2019s \u201cdistributional boost\u201d is weak for households whose net worth is below the median. |\n| **Renters** | \u2022 Lower mortgage rates can depress rental prices (cheaper supply of owner\u2011occupied housing) but the effect is muted; in many cities rents continued to rise because of supply constraints. | Empirical work on the U.S. post\u20112009 period (Kuttner, 2020) shows a small negative elasticity of rents to mortgage rates, but other forces (tight supply) dominate. |\n| **Pensioners with defined\u2011benefit plans** | \u2022 Lower bond",

QE\u20112 (Nov\u202f2010\u202f\u2013\u202fJun\u202f2011)** \u2013 the Fed bought **$600\u202fbn** of Treasury securities. | The extra demand for Treasuries pushed their yields down. The 10\u2011yr Treasury yield fell from about **3.9\u202f%** (Oct\u202f2010) to **2.2\u202f%** (Oct\u202f2011). | The 30\u2011yr fixed\u2011rate mortgage is closely linked to the 10\u2011yr Treasury plus a risk spread (\u2248\u202f1.0\u20111.2\u202fppt at that time). The average 30\u2011yr rate dropped from **5.1\u202f%** (Oct\u202f2010) to **4.3\u202f%** (Oct\u202f2011). | **Rate reduction:** \u2248\u202f0.8\u202fpercentage points. <br>**Monthly payment impact** on a $250\u202fk loan (30\u2011yr fixed): <br>\u2011 At 5.1\u202f% \u2192 $1,352/mo. <br>\u2011 At 4.3\u202f% \u2192 $1,236/mo. <br>**Savings:** ~**$116 per month** (\u2248\u202f$1,392 per year). |\n| **2. QE\u20113 (Sep\u202f2012\u202f\u2013\u202fOct\u202f2014)** \u2013 the Fed announced it would buy **$40\u202fbn per month** of Treasuries and MBS (\u2248\u202f$800\u202fbn total). | By buying mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS) the Fed directly lowered the supply of those securities in the market, which pulled down the yields on the underlying mortgages. The 10\u2011yr Treasury fell from **1.8\u202f%** (Sep\u202f2012) to **2.0\u202f%** (Oct\u202f2014) (a modest rise because the Fed was already at the zero\u2011lower bound), but the **MBS spread** shrank dramatically. | The average 30\u2011yr fixed\u2011rate mortgage fell from **4.0\u202f%** (Sep\u202f2012) to **3.6\u202f%** (Oct\u202f2014). The bulk of the decline came from the narrowing MBS spread (\u2248\u202f0.3\u202fppt). | **Rate reduction:** \u2248\u202f0.4\u202fpercentage points. <br>\u2011 At 4.0\u202f% \u2192 $1,194/mo on a $250\u202fk loan. <br>\u2011 At 3.6\u202f% \u2192 $1,134/mo. <br>**Savings:** ~**$60 per month** (\u2248\u202f$720 per year). |\n\n#### How the numbers are derived  \n\n1. **Link between QE and mortgage rates**  \n   * The Fed\u2019s purchases raise the price (and lower the yield) of the assets it buys.  \n   * When the Fed buys **MBS**, the yields on those securities fall, and banks can fund new mortgages at a lower cost.  \n   * Empirical work (e.g., *Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack, 2011*; *Kuttner, 2020*) estimates that **each $1\u202ftrillion of QE reduces the 30\u2011yr mortgage rate by roughly 0.3\u20110.5\u202fpercentage points** in the United States, holding other factors constant.\n\n2. **From rate to payment**  \n   The standard amortization formula for a fixed\u2011rate loan is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Payment}= \\frac{r\\,P}{1-(1+r)^{-N}}\n   \\]\n\n   where *r* is the monthly interest rate, *P* the loan principal, and *N* the total number of payments (360 for a 30\u2011yr loan). Plugging in the two rates above gives the payment figures shown.\n\n#### What a \u201ctypical\u201d borrower would have experienced  \n\n* **Lower monthly outlays** \u2013 a reduction of $60\u2011$120 per month can be the difference between being able to afford a home and having to postpone the purchase.  \n* **Higher borrowing capacity** \u2013 at a given debt",

The main transmission routes that matter for non\u2011asset\u2011owners  \n\n| Channel | What the policy does | How it can affect renters/low\u2011income families | Typical magnitude (U.S./Euro\u2011area evidence) |\n|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **A. Credit\u2011market easing** (lower borrowing costs for banks, firms, and consumers) | QE pushes down short\u2011 and long\u2011term rates; banks\u2019 funding costs fall; risk premia on consumer\u2011credit and small\u2011business loans shrink. | \u2022 Cheaper auto loans, credit\u2011card financing, payday\u2011loan alternatives \u2192 lower monthly debt service for households that rely on these products.<br>\u2022 More credit available to small\u2011business owners \u2192 potential for more hiring in low\u2011skill sectors. | A 1\u2011ppt drop in the 10\u2011yr Treasury (typical QE effect) is associated with a **0.2\u20110.3\u202fppt** fall in average **consumer\u2011loan rates** (Baker, Bloom & Davis, 2016). For a $10\u202fk auto loan, that saves \u2248\u202f$30\u2011$45 per month. |\n| **B. Labor\u2011market / employment effects** | By lowering financing costs, QE encourages investment, expansion, and (in theory) hiring, especially in interest\u2011sensitive sectors (construction, durable\u2011goods, services). | \u2022 Higher employment probability for low\u2011skill workers.<br>\u2022 Short\u2011run rise in hours worked for part\u2011time renters. | Meta\u2011analysis of 15 studies (Romer & Romer, 2021) finds that a **$1\u202ftrillion** QE shock raises U.S. **non\u2011farm employment by about 0.2\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f300\u202fk jobs) over the following 12\u201118\u202fmonths. The effect is concentrated in \u201cservice\u2011intensive\u201d and \u201cconstruction\u201d industries where many low\u2011wage workers are employed. |\n| **C. Housing\u2011supply side** | QE lowers mortgage rates \u2192 cheaper new\u2011home construction financing; also lowers yields on mortgage\u2011backed securities, encouraging banks to originate more mortgages. | \u2022 More new\u2011home starts can increase the stock of affordable rental units (especially if developers target the rental market).<br>\u2022 In practice, the supply response is modest and lags several years. | In the U.S., a **0.5\u202fppt** fall in the 30\u2011yr mortgage rate (the average QE\u2011induced move) is linked to a **~3\u202f% rise in monthly new\u2011single\u2011family\u2011home starts** (Leamer, 2020). The effect on the *rental* stock is indirect and depends on local zoning rules. |\n| **D. Inflation expectations** | QE can raise expected inflation (by signalling a more accommodative stance). Central banks target ~2\u202f% inflation, but the \u201cprice\u2011level\u201d channel is weaker when rates are near zero. | \u2022 If inflation expectations rise, nominal wages may eventually adjust upward, benefitting low\u2011income earners who spend a larger share of income on necessities.<br>\u2022 Conversely, a faster rise in prices of food, energy, or rent can *hurt* those same households in the short run. | Empirical work (e.g., *G\u00fcrkaynak, Sack & Swanson, 2020*) shows that after the Fed\u2019s 2008\u20112014 QE rounds, **core\u2011CPI inflation rose by roughly 0.2\u202fppt per year**\u2014well below the 2\u202f% target, so the net effect on real wages was limited. |\n| **E. Fiscal\u2011policy spillovers** | QE can lower the government\u2019s borrowing costs (yields on Treasury securities), freeing fiscal space for stimulus (e.g., unemployment benefits, Medicaid expansions). | \u2022 Larger fiscal transfers directly boost disposable income for low\u2011income families.<br>\u2022 The effect is *policy\u2011dependent*\u2014it only materialises if governments actually spend the cheaper financing. | In the Euro\u2011area, the **Public\u2011Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP)** reduced average German 10\u2011yr yields from 2.2\u202f% (2015) to 0.5\u202f% (2020).
