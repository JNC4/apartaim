How the evidence is built\n\n### 2.1. Types of studies that inform the link  \n\n| Study design | What it contributes | Main limitations |\n|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| **Prospective cohort studies** (e.g., EPIC, Nurses\u2019 Health Study, Health Professionals Follow\u2011up Study, US Million Veteran Program) | Large numbers, long follow\u2011up, can adjust for many confounders, capture habitual diet before disease onset. | Measurement error in dietary questionnaires, residual confounding (e.g., lifestyle, socioeconomic status). |\n| **Case\u2011control studies** (often hospital\u2011based) | Useful for rare cancers, can explore detailed dietary patterns. | Recall bias (cases may over\u2011report \u201cunhealthy\u201d foods), selection bias. |\n| **Randomised controlled feeding trials** (short\u2011term, \u22642\u202fyears) | Direct test of causality for intermediate biomarkers (e.g., DNA adducts, inflammation, gut microbiome). | Not feasible for cancer endpoints (needs decades), small sample sizes, often use processed meat or high\u2011dose interventions. |\n| **Mendelian randomisation (MR) studies** (genetic proxies for meat intake) | Offer a quasi\u2011randomised approach that can reduce confounding. | Instruments for meat intake are weak; pleiotropy (genes affect other pathways) can bias results. |\n| **Animal & mechanistic studies** | Identify plausible biological pathways (e.g., N\u2011nitroso compounds, heme\u2011iron catalyzed lipid peroxidation, gut microbiota metabolites). | Species differences; high doses may not reflect human consumption. |\n| **Systematic reviews & meta\u2011analyses** | Synthesize many studies, assess consistency, explore dose\u2011response. | Quality depends on included studies; publication bias can inflate estimates. |\n\n### 2.2. Key meta\u2011analyses (selected)\n\n| Publication | Design | Main finding (per 100\u202fg/day) | Comment |\n|-------------|--------|------------------------------|---------|\n| **Aune et\u202fal., *BMJ* 2020** (WCRF systematic review) | 30 cohort + 5 case\u2011control studies (colorectal) | RR\u202f=\u202f1.12 (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f0.99\u20111.26) for every 100\u202fg/day; stronger for processed meat (RR\u202f\u2248\u202f1.20). | Updated 2022 with additional EPIC data \u2013 RR\u202f\u2248\u202f1.16. |\n| **Zhang et\u202fal., *Lancet Oncology* 2021** (pancreatic) | 14 cohort studies | RR\u202f=\u202f1",

Heme can catalyse the formation of N\u2011nitroso compounds (NOCs) in the gut, especially when combined with a diet high in nitrite\u2011rich foods. |\n| **Processed red meat** | **Cured, smoked, or fermented** products that were originally red meat: <br>\u2022 Bacon (pork belly) <br>\u2022 Sausages (e.g., hot dogs, salami, chorizo, bratwurst) <br>\u2022 Deli meats (ham, roast beef, pastrami, corned beef) <br>\u2022 Canned or jarred meat (spam, meat p\u00e2t\u00e9) <br>\u2022 Jerky, dried beef, biltong <br>\u2022 Meat\u2011based spreads (p\u00e2t\u00e9, rillettes) | The meat is **treated** with one or more of the following: <br>\u2022 **Curing salts** (sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate) \u2192 add colour, inhibit spoilage <br>\u2022 **Smoking** (wood smoke, liquid smoke) \u2192 adds flavour, preservative compounds <br>\u2022 **Fermentation** (addition of starter cultures) <br>\u2022 **Addition of sugars, spices, phosphates, or other additives** <br>\u2022 **Heat\u2011treatment** (e.g., precooking, extrusion) | \u2022 **Nitrite/nitrate** can convert to **N\u2011nitroso compounds (NOCs)** in the stomach, which are known carcinogens in animals and probable human carcinogens. <br>\u2022 **Smoking** deposits polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other mutagenic chemicals on the surface. <br>\u2022 **Fermentation** can produce biogenic amines that may enhance NOC formation. <br>\u2022 The combination of **high salt**, **preservatives**, and **heme iron** creates a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for generating carcinogenic compounds during digestion. |\n\n### How the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies them  \n\n| IARC group (2015) | Substance | Rationale |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Group\u202f1** \u2013 *Carcinogenic to humans* | **Processed meat** (any meat that has been transformed by salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes) | Based on sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that consumption increases colorectal cancer risk; mechanistic data (NOCs, PAHs) support causality. |\n| **Group\u202f2A** \u2013 *Probably carcinogenic to humans* | **Red meat** (un\u2011processed beef, pork, lamb, goat) | Evidence for colorectal cancer is \u201climited but suggestive\u201d; the same mechanistic concerns (heme\u2011iron\u2011mediated NOC formation, heme\u2011driven oxidative stress) apply, but the epidemiologic signal is weaker than for processed meat. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fCooking methods and the formation of carcinogens  \n\n| Cooking method | Typical temperature range | Key carcinogenic compounds formed | Evidence linking method to cancer risk |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Grilling / Barbecuing / Broiling (direct flame, high heat)** | 200\u202f\u2013\u202f300\u202f\u00b0C (392\u202f\u2013\u202f572\u202f\u00b0F) or higher | \u2022 **Heterocyclic amines (HCAs)** \u2013 e.g., PhIP, MeIQx, DiMeIQx <br>\u2022 **Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)** \u2013 e.g., benzo[a]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene | \u2022 Large meta\u2011analyses (e.g., Bouvard\u202fet\u202fal., *Int J Cancer* 2020) show a 10\u201120\u202f% higher colorectal cancer risk for people who frequently grill meat (\u2265\u202f2\u20133\u202ftimes/week). <br>\u2022 A 2022 pooled analysis of 7 US cohorts (\u2248\u202f1",

Many national dietary guidelines (e.g., US Dietary Guidelines 2025\u20112030, UK NHS, Australian Dietary Guidelines) advise **no more than 70\u202fg per day** (\u2248\u202f2\u20113\u202foz) and to keep weekly intake **<\u202f350\u202fg**. | A meta\u2011analysis of 20 prospective cohorts (Aune\u202fet\u202fal., *BMJ*\u202f2020) found that **each 50\u202fg/day increase** in processed meat was associated with a **\u2248\u202f18\u202f% higher relative risk of colorectal cancer**.
