The same basic logic is used in the United States (U.S.\u202fFood and Drug Administration, FDA), the European Union (European Food Safety Authority, EFSA), Canada, Australia, Japan, China, Brazil and many other countries that have adopted the **FAO/WHO \u201cCodex Alimentarius\u201d** principles.  \nBelow is a **road\u2011map of the scientific workflow**, followed by the **key data that are generated**, the **interpretation of those data**, and finally a **summary of where the scientific community agrees and where genuine uncertainties remain**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Safety\u2011Assessment Framework (What is evaluated?)\n\n| Step | Main Question | Typical Tests & Data |\n|------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Molecular Characterisation** | What exactly has been changed in the plant\u2019s DNA? | \u2022 DNA sequencing of the inserted construct (gene(s), promoter, terminator, selectable marker). <br>\u2022 Copy\u2011number determination (how many insertions). <br>\u2022 Location in the genome (is it inserted into a gene or a non\u2011coding region?). |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Protein Expression & Biochemistry** | What new protein(s) are produced, and how much? | \u2022 Quantify the novel protein(s) in edible tissues (ELISA, mass\u2011spectrometry). <br>\u2022 Verify that the protein\u2019s amino\u2011acid sequence matches the intended design. |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Comparative Compositional Analysis** | Does the GM food differ nutritionally or chemically from its conventional counterpart? | \u2022 Macro\u2011nutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate, fibre). <br>\u2022 Micronutrients (vitamins, minerals). <br>\u2022 Antinutrients, natural toxins, and plant secondary metabolites (e.g., glucosinolates, alkaloids). |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Toxicology** | Could the new protein or any unintended change be toxic? | \u2022 **Acute toxicity** (single\u2011dose LD\u2085\u2080 in rodents). <br>\u2022 **Sub\u2011chronic (90\u2011day) feeding studies** in rodents. <br>\u2022 **In\u2011vitro cell\u2011based assays** (e.g., cytotoxicity, genotoxicity \u2013 Ames test, micronucleus assay). |\n| **5\ufe0f\u20e3 Allergenicity** | Might the new protein trigger allergic reactions? | \u2022 **Sequence homology** to known allergens (\u226535\u202f% identity over 80\u202faa). <br>\u2022 **Stability to digestive enzymes** (pepsin resistance). <br>\u2022 **Serum IgE binding** tests if the donor organism is known to be allergenic. |\n| **6\ufe0f\u20e3 Nutritional Impact** | Does the GM food improve, reduce or otherwise change nutritional value? | \u2022 Feeding trials in target animals (e.g., rats, poultry). <br>\u2022 Human clinical data when a **nutritionally enhanced** trait is claimed (e.g., Golden Rice \u03b2\u2011carotene). |\n| **7\ufe0f\u20e3 Environmental & Gene\u2011Flow Considerations** (indirectly relevant to human safety) | Could the GM crop lead to the spread of novel traits to wild relatives or create new weed problems? | \u2022 Field\u2011trial monitoring, pollen\u2011dispersal studies, weed\u2011iness assessments. |\n| **8\ufe0f\u20e3 Post\u2011Market Surveillance** | Are there any adverse effects that only become apparent after wide consumption? | \u2022 **Passive monitoring** (adverse\u2011event reporting, food\u2011borne illness databases). <br>\u2022 **Targeted cohort studies** (e.g., the European \u201cFood\u2011Aid\u201d monitoring program). |\n\nEach step produces **quantitative data** that are compared against **established safety thresholds** (e.g., No\u2011Observed\u2011Adverse\u2011Effect Level, NOAEL) and against the **natural variability** found in conventional varieties of the same species.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

How PMM is actually carried out for Bt\u202fcorn\n\n| Monitoring component | Typical activities for MON\u202f810 (or other Bt corn) | Who conducts it | Frequency / Duration |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **a. Food/feed compositional surveillance** | \u2022 Random sampling of commercial grain and processed products (e.g., cornmeal, tortilla flour). <br>\u2022 Laboratory analysis for Cry1Ab protein levels, mycotoxin (e.g., fumonisin) levels, nutrient composition. | National food\u2011safety labs (e.g., EFSA\u2019s European Reference Laboratory, USDA\u2011ARS labs, FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition). | Annual or biennial, aligned with market\u2011share cycles. |\n| **b. Human\u2011health adverse\u2011event reporting** | \u2022 Voluntary reporting systems (e.g., FDA\u2019s MedWatch, EU\u2019s RASFF notifications). <br>\u2022 Targeted cohort studies in regions with high Bt\u2011corn consumption (e.g., Spain\u2019s \u201cCohort of Spanish Adults\u201d 2005\u20112015). | Public\u2011health agencies, academic researchers, NGOs (often in collaboration with regulators). | Continuous; data aggregated every 1\u20133\u202fyears for trend analysis. |\n| **c. Animal\u2011feed surveillance** | \u2022 Monitoring of growth performance, feed conversion ratios, and health parameters in livestock fed Bt\u2011corn. <br>\u2022 Residue testing for Cry1Ab in meat, milk, and eggs. | USDA\u2011APHIS, FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, industry feed\u2011lot auditors. | Every 2\u20134\u202fyears (most recent EU feed\u2011monitoring report 2022). |\n| **d. Environmental monitoring** | \u2022 **Resistance management**: sampling of target pest populations (e.g., European corn borer) for Cry1Ab susceptibility (bioassays, allele\u2011frequency PCR). <br>\u2022 **Gene\u2011flow studies**: pollen\u2011mediated hybridisation to wild relatives (e.g., *Zea",
