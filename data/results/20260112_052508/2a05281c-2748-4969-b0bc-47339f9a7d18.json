The goal is to give you enough context to decide for yourself what kind of milk (if any) fits your health goals and risk tolerance.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cpasteurization\u201d actually does\n\n| Process | Typical conditions | Main effect on milk |\n|---------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Kills most vegetative bacteria; retains many enzymes and proteins |\n| **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs | Same bacterial kill\u2011rate as LTLT but with slightly more denaturation of heat\u2011sensitive components |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fs | Near\u2011sterilization; shelf\u2011stable for months; more loss of flavor and some vitamins |\n\nPasteurization was introduced in the late\u20111800s to **dramatically reduce food\u2011borne illness** caused by pathogens that can be present in milk from healthy\u2011looking cows (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*).  The heat treatment reduces the total bacterial load by **\u22655 log10** (i.e., 99.999%+ reduction).\n\n---\n\n## 2. The strongest safety evidence\n\n### 2.1.

Microbiological studies\n| Study | Method | Findings |\n|-------|--------|----------|\n| *Urbano et\u202fal., 2021, J. Food Prot.* | Tested 150 raw milk samples from U.S. farms | 38\u202f% contained *E.\u202fcoli* O157, 13\u202f% contained *Salmonella*, 22\u202f% contained *Listeria* spp. |\n| *Hussein et\u202fal., 2020, Food Control* | Paired raw vs. HTST milk from same herd | Raw milk had a mean total aerobic count of **10\u2076\u202fCFU/mL**; HTST reduced it to **10\u00b2\u202fCFU/mL**. |\n| *Miller et\u202fal., 2018, Clinical Infect Dis.* | Case\u2011control study of 103 pediatric *E.\u202fcoli* O157 infections | Raw milk consumption was the single most common exposure (OR\u202f\u2248\u202f12). |\n\nThese studies consistently show that **raw milk can harbor pathogenic bacteria at levels capable of causing disease**, even when the source herd appears healthy.\n\n### 2.3. Risk\u2011assessment models\n- The U.S. **Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)** estimates that **pasteurization prevents about 130,000 illnesses, 2,500 hospitalizations, and 30 deaths each year** in the United States.\n- A 2014 **World Health Organization (WHO) risk\u2011benefit analysis** for dairy in high\u2011income countries concluded that the *net health impact of raw milk is negative* because the increase in potential probiotic/immune benefits is far outweighed by the rise in food\u2011borne disease risk.\n\n---\n\n##",

In practice, raw milk that passes the \u201cstandard\u201d microbial limits (\u226410\u202fCFU/mL for coliforms, \u22641\u202fCFU/10\u202fmL for *E.\u202fcoli*) can still contain *pathogenic* strains at levels that are invisible on routine tests but become dangerous once the product is stored at refrigerator temperatures for days.\n\n**Consensus:**  All major public\u2011health agencies (U.S. CDC, FDA, USDA; European Food Safety Authority (EFSA); World Health Organization (WHO)) agree that pasteurisation reliably reduces the risk of food\u2011borne illness by >99\u202f% for the pathogens most commonly associated with dairy.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Lactoferrin binds iron and has **antimicrobial and immunomodulatory** properties. |\n| **Immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM)** | Raw milk contains **higher concentrations of intact secretory IgA** (\u2248\u202f0.5\u20131\u202fg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9) compared with pasteurized milk where most are denatured. | Secretory IgA can **neutralize pathogens in the gut lumen** and shape the mucosal immune response. |\n| **Growth factors (e.g., Transforming Growth Factor\u2011\u03b2, Epidermal Growth Factor)** | Partially heat\u2011labile; some survive HTST but are reduced. | These molecules can **promote gut epithelial repair** and influence immune cell differentiation. |\n| **Bioactive peptides (released from casein and whey during fermentation or digestion)** | Raw milk contains native peptides; pasteurization does not destroy them, but the **profile changes** because heat can cause limited proteolysis. | Certain peptides have **antimicrobial, antihypertensive, or opioid\u2011like** activities that can affect gut motility and immune signaling. |\n| **Micro\u2011 and macro\u2011minerals (Ca, Mg, Zn, Se)** | Minor differences (heat can cause slight loss of vitamin C, some B\u2011vitamins) but minerals remain essentially the same. | Minerals are essential for many immune functions, but the amounts in a single glass of milk are modest compared with dietary recommendations. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Raw milk *does* contain a richer mixture of live microbes and heat\u2011sensitive bioactive proteins than standard HTST\u2011pasteurized milk.

The most abundant taxa are **non\u2011probiotic** environmental microbes (e.g., *Acinetobacter*, *Pseudomonas*) that are not known to confer health benefits. <br>\u2022 **Human\u2011intervention trials** that deliberately fed raw milk to adults or children are **rare** (ethical constraints) and, when they exist, are **small, short\u2011term, and not double\u2011blinded**.  The most cited trial (the \u201cRaw Milk Study\u201d in the Netherlands, 1999\u20112002; see below) found *no statistically significant change* in gut\u2011microbiota diversity after 6\u202fweeks of raw\u2011milk consumption compared with pasteurised milk.  <br>\u2022 **Systematic reviews** (e.g., O\u2019Connor\u202f2022, *Nutrition Reviews*; Haug\u202f2023, *International Journal of Food Microbiology*) conclude that **evidence that raw milk delivers a clinically meaningful probiotic effect is currently lacking**.  The few positive signals are confounded by other farm\u2011related exposures (raw\u2011milk\u2011derived *Streptococcus* spp. may simply be a marker of a \u201cfarm\u2011environment\u201d lifestyle). | **Strong consensus** among microbiologists, nutrition scientists, and public\u2011health agencies: raw milk does contain live microbes, but the composition is unpredictable, and there is **no high\u2011quality evidence** that these microbes act as probiotics in the human gut. |\n| **(b) Raw milk boosts the immune system (e.g., reduces allergies, asthma, or infections)** | Epidemiological observations in \u201cfarm children\u201d show lower rates of atopy; raw milk is blamed as the protective factor. | \u2022 **The \u201cfarm\u2011child\u201d literature** (e.g., Braun\u2011Freud\u202f2002, *Allergy*; Riedler\u202f2007, *J Allergy Clin Immunol*) consistently reports **lower prevalence of asthma, hay fever, and eczema** among children raised on traditional dairy farms.  However, **multivariate analyses** attribute the protective effect primarily to **early\u2011life exposure to a diverse microbial environment** (e.g., livestock, stable dust, unprocessed farm feed) **and to consumption of farm\u2011produced foods, including raw milk**.  The contribution of raw milk *alone* is **hard to separate**. <br>\u2022 **Controlled intervention studies**: <br>   \u2013 **The \u201cGerman Raw Milk Study\u201d (Vogel\u202f2007, *Pediatrics*)**: 2\u2011year\u2011old children (n\u202f=\u202f75) were randomised to drink 250\u202fmL/day of raw cow\u2019s milk, pasteurised milk, or skimmed milk for 6\u202fmonths.
