Specific deterrence is a logical possibility but not empirically testable.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fTheoretical expectations\n\n| Theory | Prediction about death\u2011penalty vs. life imprisonment |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Rational\u2011choice / classical criminology** (Beccaria, Bentham) | Crime is a cost\u2011benefit calculation; a *more severe* penalty (death) should lower the expected benefit of murder, *provided* the offender believes the penalty will be applied. |\n| **Deterrence\u2011by\u2011certainty** (modern criminology) | The *likelihood* of being caught and punished matters far more than the *severity* of the punishment. In societies where executions are rare and delayed, the certainty is low \u2192 little deterrent effect. |\n| **Psychological/behavioral perspectives** | Many violent crimes (especially murders) are committed in the heat of the moment, under intoxication, or by individuals with mental illness; these actors do not conduct a rational cost\u2011benefit analysis, so the severity of the sanction matters little. |\n| **Brutalization hypothesis** | Public, state\u2011sanctioned killing can legitise lethal violence, potentially increasing homicide rates, especially when executions are swift and publicised. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  Theories do not agree a priori that \u201cdeath\u202f>\u202flife\u201d should deter more.  The most influential modern view is that *certainty* (and speed) outweigh *severity*.\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fEmpirical evidence \u2013\u202fWhat the data actually show  \n\n### 3.1\u202fEarly \u201cclassic\u201d studies that found a deterrent effect  \n\n| Study | Method | Main finding |",
