Those changes do not affect everyone uniformly.  Below is a concise, evidence\u2011based map of the main channels through which QE reaches different groups, together with the degree of scholarly consensus and the key uncertainties that remain.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Households  \n\n| Sub\u2011group | Main QE channel | Typical effect | Evidence & consensus |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **Borrowers (mortgage, car, student\u2011loan, credit\u2011card users)** | Lower short\u2011 and long\u2011term interest rates \u2192 cheaper loans | Real\u2011interest\u2011rate on debt falls \u2192 higher disposable income, larger propensity to spend or refinance | *Broad consensus*: Studies by the Federal Reserve (e.g., 2015 \u201cThe Effects of QE on Mortgage Rates\u201d) and the Bank of England find a 1\u2011percentage\u2011point fall in policy rates reduces 30\u2011year mortgage rates by 0.3\u20110.5\u202fpp. |\n| **Savers (especially retirees on fixed\u2011income portfolios)** | Same lower yields, plus \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d (investors move from safe bonds to riskier assets) | Nominal returns on cash, savings accounts, and short\u2011term bonds fall; real returns can become negative after inflation | *Mixed evidence*: IMF (2020) notes a \u201cdistributional cost\u201d to savers, but some research (e.g., Krishnamurthy & Vissing-Jorgensen, 2021) finds modest welfare loss because many savers also hold housing or equities. |\n| **Home\u2011owners** | Lower mortgage rates + \u201cwealth effect\u201d from rising house prices (driven by cheaper financing & portfolio shifts) | Higher home\u2011equity wealth \u2192 increased consumption and confidence | *Strong consensus*: U.S. and UK data show house\u2011price appreciation of 5\u201110\u202f% in QE periods (e.g., Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 2022). |\n| **Non\u2011home\u2011owner renters** | Same lower rates, but no direct wealth gain; may face higher rents if housing prices push rents up | Little or negative net effect; possible \u201crent\u2011price spill\u2011over\u201d | *Uncertain*: Limited empirical work; the effect depends on local housing markets and rent\u2011control regimes. |\n| **Low\u2011income households** | Indirect effects through employment and prices; limited direct asset\u2011price gains | Gains from higher employment can be offset by higher food/energy prices if QE fuels inflation | *Consensus*: QE\u2019s impact on poverty is modest; IMF (2021) finds \u201cno clear evidence that QE reduces income poverty.\u201d |\n\n### Key Take\u2011aways for households\n- **Borrowers** tend to benefit the most in the short run.  \n- **Savers and low\u2011income renters** can be disadvantaged, especially if inflation later erodes real returns.  \n- The net welfare impact depends on the *balance* between lower borrowing costs, asset\u2011price gains (mostly for owners), and any inflationary pressures.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Firms  \n\n| Sub\u2011group | Main QE channel | Typical effect | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented manufacturers** | Lower domestic interest rates \u2192 weaker currency (portfolio rebalancing pushes capital out of the country) | More competitive exports; higher sales and employment in export sectors | *Broad consensus*: Studies (e.g., Gagnon et\u202fal., 2015, \u201cThe Effect of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Large\u2011Scale Asset Purchases\u201d) show a 10\u202f% depreciation of the dollar after QE rounds, boosting export margins. |\n| **Capital\u2011intensive firms (energy, utilities, heavy industry)** | Cheaper corporate\u2011bond financing; lower cost of capital | Higher investment, especially in long\u2011run projects; sometimes higher leverage | *Mixed*: Evidence from the Eurozone (Borio & Gambacorta, 2020) shows a modest rise in corporate debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratios, but the investment response is weaker when credit constraints dominate. |\n| **SMEs (small\u2011 and medium\u2011size enterprises)** |",

A homeowner who bought before the rise saw a sizable rise in equity, while a renter saw no such gain.\n\n---\n\n## People who rely mainly on savings  \n\n### What QE does to the \u201csaver\u2019s\u201d return\n\n| Savings vehicle | Typical pre\u2011QE yield (2007\u201108) | Typical post\u2011QE yield (2012\u201113) | Real\u2011return (after inflation) |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Money\u2011market fund** | 3.0\u202f% (nominal) | 1.1\u202f% | +0.2\u202f% (inflation \u2248\u202f1.0\u202f%) |\n| **1\u2011yr Treasury bill** | 2.8\u202f% | 0.5\u202f% | \u20130.5\u202f% |\n| **5\u2011yr Treasury note** | 3.5\u202f% | 1.3\u202f% | \u20130",

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Quantitative Easing (QE) Touches Retirees and Others Who Live Mostly on Fixed\u2011Income Savings  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of the mechanisms, the typical magnitude of the impact, and what the research says about the net welfare effect for retirees (or anyone whose primary income comes from interest\u2011bearing assets).\n\n---\n\n### 1. The three main transmission channels that matter for savers  \n\n| Channel | What the central bank does | What the market feels | How it shows up for a retiree |\n|---------|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **a. Lower policy\u2011rate \u2192 lower short\u2011 and long\u2011term yields** | The Fed (or ECB, BoJ, etc.) cuts the policy rate to near\u2011zero and then adds reserves by buying Treasuries, agency MBS, and sometimes corporate bonds. | Treasury yields, corporate\u2011bond yields, and mortgage rates all fall. | The coupon on a 10\u2011yr Treasury that used to be 3\u202f% may drop to 1\u202f% \u2013 the retiree\u2019s \u201cinterest\u2011only\u201d income falls by two\u2011thirds. |\n| **b. Portfolio\u2011rebalancing (the \u201csearch\u2011for\u2011yield\u201d effect)** | When safe government bonds become cheap, investors shift into riskier assets (high\u2011yield corporates, equities, REITs, emerging\u2011market debt). | Prices of those riskier assets rise, their yields fall. | A retiree who holds a diversified bond fund sees the fund\u2019s average yield fall even more than Treasury yields because the fund now holds more low\u2011yielding corporate or mortgage\u2011backed securities. |\n| **c. Inflation expectations** | QE expands the monetary base; if it eventually leads to higher inflation, the *real* return on nominal bonds erodes. | Inflation expectations rise modestly (often a few\u2011tenths of a percent) and later actual inflation can exceed the original nominal yield. | Even if a retiree\u2019s nominal coupon stays at 2\u202f%, real purchasing power may drop to 0\u202f% or negative once inflation hits 2\u20113\u202f%. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
