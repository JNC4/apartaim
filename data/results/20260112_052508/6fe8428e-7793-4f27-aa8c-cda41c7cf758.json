This \u201ctraining\u201d involves:\n\n1. **Antibody production** \u2013 proteins that bind to the pathogen and block infection.\n2. **Memory B cells** \u2013 long\u2011lived cells that can rapidly make more antibodies on re\u2011exposure.\n3. **Memory T cells** \u2013 help coordinate the response and kill infected cells.\n\nWhen many children are immunised, **herd immunity** arises: enough people are immune that the pathogen cannot easily find a susceptible host, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants too young for certain shots, people with certain immune disorders).\n\n---\n\n### Main benefits of childhood vaccination\n\n| Benefit | Evidence (selected) | Magnitude of impact |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| **Prevention of disease** | Systematic reviews (e.g., WHO, CDC) show >99\u202f% reduction in incidence of diseases such as measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis after vaccine introduction. | Millions of cases averted each year; e.g., measles deaths dropped from ~2.6\u202fmillion in 1990 to <100\u202f000 in 2020. |\n| **Reduction in complications & death** | Meta\u2011analyses link vaccination to \u226590\u202f% decline in disease\u2011related mortality for most target diseases. | In the U.S., routine childhood vaccines prevent an estimated **30,000\u201340,000 deaths** annually. |\n| **Herd immunity** | Modeling studies (e.g., Keeling & Rohani 2020) show that >90\u202f% coverage for measles, >95\u202f% for pertussis, etc., can interrupt transmission. | Protects immunocomprom",

The immune system sees many viral proteins, builds both antibodies **and** a strong T\u2011cell response, and creates memory cells that last for years. | Usually given early (2\u201115\u202fmo) because the immune system can tolerate the low\u2011level infection. |\n| **Inactivated (killed)** | Whole virus/bacteria that has been chemically or heat\u2011inactivated (e.g., polio IPV, hepatitis\u202fA) | The antigen cannot replicate, so it mainly stimulates antibody production. Often needs \u22652 doses and an adjuvant (e.g., aluminum salts) to boost the response. | 2\u20113 doses spaced weeks\u2011months apart. |\n| **Subunit / recombinant / conjugate** | Only selected proteins, polysaccharides, or virus\u2011like particles (e.g., Hib, pneumococcal conjugate, hepatitis\u202fB, HPV, newer protein\u2011based COVID\u201119 vaccines) | Provides the immune system with the precise \u201csignature\u201d it needs to recognize the pathogen, without any whole\u2011organism material.
