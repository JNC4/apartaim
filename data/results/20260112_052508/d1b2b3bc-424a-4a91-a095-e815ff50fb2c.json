If those tenants stay for a long time, the unit stays \u201clocked\u201d at the low, legally\u2011allowed rent, even though market rents outside the control may be rising quickly. |\n| **Vacancy\u2011control** | A specific design that extends the lock\u2011in to the *next* tenant as well: when the original tenant moves out, the new tenant can only pay the same capped rent (plus a small, formula\u2011driven increase). This creates a *chain* of locked\u2011in rents that can last for decades. |\n| **Rent\u2011increase\u2011only** (the opposite) | The rent ceiling applies **only while a tenant stays**. As soon as the unit becomes vacant, the landlord can set a market rent for the next tenant. This eliminates the lock\u2011in for future renters, though the original tenant still benefits while they remain. |\n\n**Why the terminology matters:**  \n- \u201cLock\u2011in\u201d is a *dynamic* feature of the policy, not a static number. It is the *duration* of the rent ceiling on a particular unit that drives the downstream effects on supply and on the ability of new renters to locate affordable housing.  \n- The longer the lock\u2011in period, the larger the *inter\u2011generational* gap between who receives the benefit (the incumbent tenant) and who bears the cost (future renters).\n\n---\n\n### 2.\u202fHow lock\u2011in operates in practice  \n\n#### A.

The rent\u2011increase\u2011only rule (the \u201cpost\u2011lock\u2011in\u201d design used in many newer U.S. statutes)\n\n1. **While a tenant stays**: rent can rise only by the statutory ceiling (CPI\u202f+\u202fX).  \n2. **When the unit becomes vacant**: the landlord can set **any rent** (subject to any \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction rules).  \n3. **Result:** Only the incumbent tenant enjoys the low rent; the next renter pays market price.\n\n---\n\n### 3.\u202fWhy lock\u2011in matters for *new* renters  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Who is affected (short\u2011 and long\u2011run) |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Reduced turnover** | Tenants have a strong incentive to stay because moving would mean paying market rent elsewhere. | \u2022 **Incumbent tenants** keep a cheap unit. <br>\u2022 **Potential movers** (often younger, lower\u2011income households) face a *scarcity* of vacancies. |\n| **Artificially low \u201canchor\u201d rents** | Because the legal rent is stuck at a historic low, landlords cannot raise the price enough to cover higher operating costs (property taxes, utilities, insurance). | \u2022 Landlords may **delay maintenance** \u2192 lower quality for everyone. <br>\u2022 They may **convert** the unit to a different use (condo, short\u2011term rental) \u2192 *fewer* units for rent. |\n| **Distorted price signals** | Market rents rise while a growing share of the stock stays at the old, low rate. | \u2022 **New construction** becomes less attractive \u2192 *fewer* new affordable units. <br>\u2022 **Existing un\u2011controlled units** become *more* expensive, pushing low\u2011income renters out of those markets. |\n| **\u201cQueueing\u201d effect** | When a unit finally becomes vacant, many households line up for it because it is a \u201crare\u201d affordable option. |",

What the effect is, in plain language  \n\n*When a rent\u2011control ordinance caps the rent that an existing tenant pays, that tenant has a strong financial incentive to stay in the unit for as long as possible.*  \nBecause moving would almost certainly mean giving up the artificially low rent and having to pay the market rate (or a much higher \u201cvacancy\u2011de\u2011controlled\u201d rent), many tenants remain for years\u2014sometimes decades.  \n\nThis persistence of occupancy is called the **lock\u2011in effect** (also known as **tenure\u2011lock**, **occupancy lock**, or **rental\u2011tenure inertia**). It is a *behavioral* consequence of a *price\u2011ceiling* policy, not a legal requirement; the law simply makes the status\u2011quo cheaper than any plausible alternative.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The economic chain that starts with lock\u2011in  \n\n| Step | What happens | Why it matters for *new* renters |\n|------|--------------|---------------------------------|\n| **A. Low\u2011rent tenant stays** | The tenant\u2019s monthly cash outflow is below market, so the *opportunity cost* of moving is high. | The unit stays occupied longer than it would in a free\u2011market where rents adjust quickly. |\n| **B. Vacancy rate falls** | Fewer apartments become vacant each year. In San\u202fFrancisco (1990\u20112020) the *overall* rental vacancy rate hovered around **2\u20113\u202f%**, well below the 5\u20116\u202f% \u201chealthy\u201d benchmark for a dynamic market. | With fewer openings, the *search time* for a new renter lengthens; competition for each vacancy intensifies. |\n| **C. Landlords can charge higher \u201cvacancy\u2011de\u2011controlled\u201d rents** | When a controlled unit finally empties, the landlord can raise the rent to the *legal* market level (often called \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d). Because the supply of such openings is tiny, landlords can set a relatively high rent and still find a tenant. | The *effective* market rent for newcomers is higher than the \u201ccapped\u201d rent that long\u2011term tenants enjoy. |\n| **D. New construction is discouraged** (see previous answer) | Developers see a smaller pool of \u201cfree\u2011market\u201d units that can be sold or rented at market rates, reducing the incentive to build. | Over the long run the *overall* stock of affordable units shrinks, compounding the scarcity created by lock\u2011in. |\n| **E. Shadow\u2011prices appear** | Landlords may ask for \u201ckey money,\u201d large security deposits, or require tenants to sign \u201ccash\u2011for\u2011keys\u201d agreements to compensate for the rent gap. | Even if the posted rent looks affordable, the *total cost of entry* can be prohibitive for low\u2011income renters. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.
