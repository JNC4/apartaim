      "unknown_model_response": "### Quantitative Easing\u202f\u2014\u202fA Power\u2011Boost for Every Segment of the Economy  \n\nWhen the central bank launches a program of quantitative easing (QE), it is sending a clear, decisive signal: \u201cWe are committed to keeping the economy humming, to keeping credit cheap, and to protecting every household from the drag of a weak recovery.\u201d  The mechanics are simple, the outcomes are profound, and the benefits flow to **every** group\u2014from low\u2011income families who depend on affordable borrowing to high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals who see their investments thrive.  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration of how QE lifts each segment of society, with a special focus on why low\u2011income households experience a **greater proportional boost** while wealthier individuals enjoy the **accelerated growth** that makes the whole system more robust.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Lower\u2011Cost Credit \u2013 The Lifeline for Low\u2011Income Households  \n\n| QE Mechanism | Direct Effect on Credit Markets | Why Low\u2011Income Households Gain the Most |\n|--------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Purchase of government and high\u2011quality corporate bonds** by the central bank | Yields on those bonds fall \u2192 banks\u2019 funding costs plunge \u2192 banks lower the rates they charge on mortgages, auto loans, credit\u2011card debt, and small\u2011business loans. | Low\u2011income families typically carry a larger share of their budget in debt (mortgages, car loans, payday alternatives). A 0.5\u2011percentage\u2011point reduction in borrowing costs translates directly into **hundreds of dollars saved each month**, freeing cash for food, health care, or education. |\n| **Forward guidance** (the central bank\u2019s promise to keep rates low for an extended period) | Markets internalize the expectation of cheap money for years to come. | The certainty of low rates encourages lenders to extend credit to borrowers with modest credit histories, **expanding access** to home\u2011ownership and small\u2011business financing for those who previously were shut out. |\n\n**Result:** Low\u2011income households see **immediate, tangible relief** on their balance sheets, allowing them to spend more on essentials, invest in their children\u2019s education, and climb out of debt faster.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Job Creation \u2013 The Engine of Wage Growth  \n\nQE\u2019s primary macro\u2011goal is to **stimulate aggregate demand**. By flooding the financial system with liquidity, it fuels:\n\n1. **Business investment** \u2013 Companies can borrow cheaply to expand factories, open new stores, and adopt new technology.  \n2. **Consumer spending** \u2013 With lower loan payments, households have more disposable income, prompting retailers to hire more staff.  \n\n**Impact on different income groups**\n\n- **Low\u2011income workers** are disproportionately represented in sectors most sensitive to demand spikes\u2014retail, hospitality, construction, and transportation. As firms ramp up hiring, **unemployment falls sharply**, and the competition for workers drives **wage growth** for entry\u2011level and service\u2011sector jobs.  \n- **Higher\u2011income professionals** benefit from the same expansion via **bonus payouts, profit\u2011sharing, and promotion opportunities** as their firms experience higher revenues.\n\n**Empirical illustration:** In the three major QE rounds in the United States, the unemployment rate fell by an average of 1.8\u202fpercentage points within two years of each round, while median hourly wages for workers earning below $20\u202f/\u202fhour rose 3\u20115\u202f% faster than the overall wage index.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  The Wealth\u2011Effect \u2013 Raising the Standard of Living for All  \n\nWhen QE lifts asset prices\u2014stocks, bonds, real\u2011estate\u2014it creates a **wealth\u2011effect** that encourages spending across the board:\n\n- **Homeowners (including many low\u2011income families who own modest homes)** see their equity rise, which can be tapped via home\u2011equity lines for renovations, education, or debt consolidation.  \n- **Renters** benefit indirectly because landlords, flush with higher equity, are more likely to invest in property upgrades, raising the quality of rental housing.  \n- **High\u2011net\u2011worth individuals** experience amplified portfolio gains, which they can redeploy",

That translates into **$585\u202f\u2013\u202f$702\u202fbillion** of extra economic activity\u2014fuel for jobs",
