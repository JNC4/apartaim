Often partnered with non\u2011profits or community groups. | Federal\u2011run pilots (e.g., U.S.\u202fDept. of Justice \u201cProject Safe Neighborhoods\u201d), university\u2011sponsored events, or private\u2011sector \u201ccash\u2011for\u2011guns\u201d schemes. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Residents bring firearms to a designated site (often a police station, community center, or mobile \u201cbuy\u2011back truck\u201d). | Some programs allow mail\u2011in or drop\u2011box returns; a few allow \u201canonymous\u201d drop\u2011offs with no identification required. |\n| **What do participants receive?** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or \u201cstore credit.\u201d Amount is usually **flat** (e.g., $50 per gun) or **tiered** (higher for rifles/shotguns). | Some give non\u2011monetary incentives (e.g., free firearm\u2011safety classes, tickets to events). A few use \u201cpoints\u201d that can be redeemed for larger items. |\n| **Eligibility** | Most programs accept any firearm that is **legally owned** (i.e., no outstanding warrants, not stolen, not subject to a restraining\u2011order). | Some allow **unregistered** or \u201cillegal\u201d guns if the participant is willing to surrender them without fear of prosecution (often under a \u201camnesty\u201d provision). |\n| **Legal safeguards** | Participants typically sign a short waiver confirming the gun is theirs, that it is not stolen, and that they are not a prohibited person. | In \u201camnesty\u201d models the waiver is omitted; law\u2011enforcement may keep the gun as evidence if it appears stolen or linked to a crime. |\n| **Scale** | One\u2011day events (e.g., \u201cBuy\u2011Back Saturday\u201d) that collect a few hundred guns, or multi\u2011week campaigns that gather thousands. | Ongoing \u201cpermanent\u201d buy\u2011back kiosks in some cities (e.g., Seattle\u2019s \u201cGun Safe\u201d drop box). |\n\n**Key points to keep in mind**\n\n* **Voluntary** \u2013 Most U.S. programs are *voluntary*; they rely on people choosing to turn in guns.\n* **Cash incentive** \u2013 The payment is meant to offset the perceived \u201closs\u201d of a personal asset and to attract owners who might otherwise keep a gun they no longer use.\n* **No guarantee of \u201cillegal\u201d guns** \u2013 Because the process is voluntary and often anonymous, the proportion of *illicit* firearms captured is typically low (see evidence below).\n* **Disposal** \u2013 After collection, guns are usually rendered inoperable (e.g., \u201cflipping\u201d the barrel, crushing the receiver) and then destroyed or sold as scrap metal.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat the research says \u2013 Overview  \n\nThe literature on gun\u2011buyback programs falls into three broad categories:\n\n| Research focus | What is measured | Typical findings |\n|----------------|------------------|------------------|\n| **Input\u2011side outcomes** (how many guns are collected, what type) | Number of firearms, caliber, legal status, owner demographics. | Most programs collect **hundreds\u2013thousands** of guns, but the **majority are long\u2011unloaded, low\u2011risk firearms** (e.g., .22\u2011caliber rifles, older handguns). In the U.S., <\u202f10\u202f% are reported as \u201crestricted\u201d (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles) in many studies. |\n| **Behavioral outcomes** (does a buy\u2011back change owners\u2019 behavior?) | Follow\u2011up surveys of participants, recidivism among known offenders, changes in storage practices. | Limited evidence of **behavioral change** beyond the single act of surrendering the gun. Some participants report increased awareness of safe storage, but the effect is short\u2011lived and not replicated in large samples. |\n| **Violence outcomes** (does a buy\u2011back reduce shootings, homicides, suicides, accidental injuries?) | City\u2011 or county\u2011level crime statistics, suicide rates, hospital data before/after the program, often using \u201cdifference\u2011in\u2011differences\u201d (DiD) or interrupted\u2011time\u2011series designs. | **Overall, the evidence does NOT show a clear, statistically significant reduction in overall gun violence**",
