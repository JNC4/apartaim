      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) is a set of monetary\u2011policy tools that central banks use when short\u2011term policy rates are already at (or near) the zero lower bound.  By buying large quantities of government bonds and, in some programmes, corporate or mortgage\u2011backed securities, the central bank injects reserves into the banking system and tries to lower longer\u2011term yields, stimulate credit, and raise asset prices.  \n\nBecause the policy works through several transmission channels, its impact is not felt uniformly.  Below is a systematic overview of the main ways QE can affect different groups, together with the strongest empirical evidence and the points that remain debated.  The references are abbreviated for readability; full citations are provided at the end.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Households  \n\n| Group | Primary QE channels that affect them | Typical empirical findings | Key uncertainties / debates |\n|-------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Borrowers (mortgage, auto, student\u2011loan, credit\u2011card users)** | \u2022 Lower long\u2011term Treasury yields \u2192 lower mortgage and other loan rates. <br>\u2022 Banks\u2019 increased liquidity \u2192 easier credit standards. | \u2022 In the United States, the Federal Reserve\u2019s QE1\u20113 reduced 30\u2011year mortgage rates by roughly 30\u201350\u202fbps on average (Romer & Romer, 2020). <br>\u2022 In the Eurozone, mortgage spreads fell by about 15\u202fbps after the ECB\u2019s PSPP (European Central Bank, 2021). | \u2022 The magnitude varies by credit\u2011worthiness: low\u2011income borrowers often face higher \u201crisk premiums\u201d that do not fall as much (Mian & Sufi, 2021). <br>\u2022 Some studies find limited credit\u2011expansion for small\u2011business or consumer loans because banks prefer to hold excess reserves (Kuttner, 2020). |\n| **Savers / holders of cash deposits** | \u2022 Lower nominal interest rates on deposits and short\u2011term instruments. <br>\u2022 Potential \u201cnegative real rates\u201d when inflation expectations rise faster than nominal rates. | \u2022 In Japan, the Bank of Japan\u2019s QE has kept deposit rates near 0\u202f% for more than a decade, eroding real returns for savers (Ito & Mishkin, 2022). <br>\u2022 In the U.K., after BoE QE 2020\u201121, the average net interest margin on retail deposits fell by ~0.2\u202f% (Bank of England, 2022). | \u2022 The welfare loss to savers depends on their age and consumption\u2011smoothing needs; retirees who rely on interest income are hit harder, but younger households may benefit from higher employment prospects (Baker, 2021). |\n| **Owners of financial assets (stocks, bonds, REITs, mutual funds)** | \u2022 Asset\u2011price channel: QE raises the price of equities, corporate bonds, and real\u2011estate by lowering discount rates and by \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d (banks and funds shift from safe government paper to riskier assets). | \u2022 In the U.S., QE\u2011induced equity\u2011price gains have been estimated at 5\u20138\u202f% per round for the S&P\u202f500 (Gagnon, 2015). <br>\u2022 In the Eurozone, the ECB\u2019s corporate\u2011bond\u2011purchase programme lifted corporate\u2011bond yields by ~30\u202fbps and raised prices by 2\u20133\u202f% (Borio & Gambacorta, 2020). | \u2022 The distribution within asset owners matters: high\u2011net\u2011worth households hold a larger share of equities and thus capture most of the gains; low\u2011income households hold a larger share of cash and housing, which may appreciate less (Piketty & Saez, 2023). |\n| **Home\u2011owners (especially those without mortgage debt)** | \u2022 House\u2011price channel: lower mortgage rates and \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d expectations push up house prices. | \u2022 U.S. data show that each 100\u2011bp drop in the 10\u2011year yield during QE raised median home prices by ~2\u202f% (Kuttner, 2020). <br>\u2022 In the U.K., QE was associated with a 5\u201110\u202f% rise in residential prices between 2020\u201122 (Bank of England, 2022). | \u2022 The benefit accrues mainly",

      "user_message": "Wow, that makes a lot of sense\u2014especially how QE seems to lift asset prices more than it helps savers.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **worked\u2011out illustration** that follows a typical \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d U.S. household through a two\u2011year stretch of an active QE programme (similar to the Federal Reserve\u2019s QE2\u2011QE3 cycle of 2010\u20112014).
