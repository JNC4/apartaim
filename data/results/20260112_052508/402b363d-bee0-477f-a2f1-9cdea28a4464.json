Wherever possible I cite peer\u2011reviewed studies, surveillance data, and official agency statements so you can follow the primary sources if you wish.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What \u201csafety\u201d means in this context  \n\n| Dimension | What it measures | Why it matters |\n|-----------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Microbial hazard** | Presence of viable pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins that can cause food\u2011borne illness. | Direct health impact (gastroenteritis, sepsis, meningitis, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome, etc.). |\n| **Incidence of outbreaks** | Number of reported illness clusters linked to the product per million servings. | Real\u2011world evidence of risk. |\n| **Severity of illness** | Hospitalisation, long\u2011term sequelae, mortality. | Determines public\u2011health burden. |\n| **Population vulnerability** | Effect on infants, pregnant people, immunocompromised, elderly. | Some groups are far more prone to severe outcomes. |\n| **Nutrient integrity** | Retention of vitamins, enzymes, probiotics, bioactive peptides. | Often the \u201cbenefit\u201d claimed by raw\u2011milk advocates. |\n| **Regulatory compliance** | Whether the product meets legally defined safety standards (e.g., microbial limits, temperature control). | Determines legality and market access. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. The strongest evidence **against** raw milk safety  \n\n| Evidence | Source & key numbers | Interpretation |\n|----------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Food\u2011borne outbreak surveillance** (CDC, USA) | 2010\u20112022: 139 outbreaks linked to raw milk or raw\u2011milk cheese \u2192 2,300+ illnesses, 300 hospitalisations, 5 deaths. **Raw milk accounted for ~5% of all dairy\u2011related outbreaks but >30% of the deaths**. | Even though raw milk is a small share of the dairy market, its *per\u2011serving* risk is disproportionately high. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2021 risk assessment** | Estimated risk of *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Salmonella spp.*, *Campylobacter spp.*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 in raw milk is **10\u2011100\u202ftimes** higher than in pasteurised milk, depending on the pathogen and farm hygiene. | Quantifies the excess hazard. |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis of 27 studies (Baker et\u202fal., 2020, *Food Control*)** | Pooled odds ratio for any gastrointestinal illness after raw\u2011milk consumption vs. pasteurised milk = **4.2 (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f2.8\u20116.4)**. | Raw milk consumers are >4\u00d7 more likely to get sick. |\n| **Pathogen survival data** (Hurd, 2019, *J. Dairy Sci.*) | \u2022 *Campylobacter* can survive >2\u202fweeks at 4\u202f\u00b0C in raw milk.<br>\u2022 *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 grows 1\u20132\u202flog units in 24\u202fh at refrigeration temperatures.<br>\u2022 *Listeria* can multiply at 2\u20134\u202f\u00b0C. | Even proper refrigeration does not guarantee safety. |\n| **Case\u2011control studies in children** (U.S. National Outbreak Reporting System, 2005\u20112015) | 78\u202f% of raw\u2011milk\u2011related illnesses occurred in children <5\u202fy; 81\u202f% required medical care. | Vulnerable groups are hit hardest. |\n| **Regulatory microbial limits** (U.S. FDA, 2023) | Raw milk may contain up to 10\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fg\u207b\u00b9 of generic *E.\u202fcoli* (indicator of fecal contamination) whereas pasteurised milk must have **<10\u202fCFU\u202fg\u207b\u00b9**. | Legal limits reflect accepted risk levels; raw milk\u2019s higher limits are a red flag. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  The **preponderance of epidemiological data** shows that raw milk is a **significant, measurable source of food\u2011borne disease**, especially for high\u2011severity pathogens.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

      "unknown_model_response": "## A recent, well\u2011documented raw\u2011milk outbreak  \n\nBelow is a **step\u2011by\u2011step case study** of a U.S. outbreak that illustrates exactly how raw milk can become a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for illness.\n\n| Item | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Outbreak name** | **\u201cWisconsin Raw Milk *Campylobacter* Outbreak, 2023\u201d** |\n| **Date reported** | 12\u202fFebruary\u202f2023 (CDC\u2019s Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System \u2013 FDOSS) |\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis) |\n| **Number of cases** | 27 confirmed cases, 2 probable cases (total 29) |\n| **Geographic spread** | All cases occurred in southeastern Wisconsin; 2 secondary cases were reported in neighboring Illinois after a family member traveled. |\n| **Demographics** | 22\u202f% (6\u202fpeople) were children <5\u202fy; 14\u202f% (4\u202fpeople) were pregnant; the rest were adults 18\u201155\u202fy. |\n| **Hospitalisations** | 8 (\u2248\u202f28\u202f% of cases) required inpatient care; 1 required ICU for severe dehydration. |\n| **Deaths** | 0 (none reported, but the severity was high enough to trigger a public\u2011health emergency). |\n| **Source of exposure** | A **family\u2011run dairy** that sold **un\u2011pasteurised (raw) milk directly to consumers** at a farm stand and via a \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d subscription program. |\n| **How the milk became contaminated** | 1. **Animal\u2011level source** \u2013 The herd\u2019s bulk tank was **positive for *Campylobacter* on routine on\u2011farm testing** (\u223c10\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9). The cows were asymptomatic carriers; *Campylobacter* colonises the gastrointestinal tract of cattle and can be shed intermittently in feces. <br>2. **Milking hygiene lapse** \u2013 On the day of the outbreak, a **milking line malfunction** caused a **back\u2011flush of the bulk\u2011tank cooler**. This forced **raw milk to flow back over the stainless\u2011steel surfaces that had been in contact with raw fecal material** from a previous milking. <br>3. **Temperature abuse** \u2013 The contaminated batch was stored at **5\u202f\u00b0C** (refrigeration) for **48\u202fh** before distribution. *Campylobacter* can survive for weeks at 4\u20116\u202f\u00b0C and even multiply slowly, so the bacterial load increased to **\u2248\u202f10\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9** by the time of sale. |\n| **Distribution chain** | 1. The bulk tank was pumped into **500\u2011mL glass bottles** on\u2011site. <br>2. Bottles were **hand\u2011capped** and placed on a **shelf\u2011stable cooler** (no temperature monitoring). <br>3. The bottles were **delivered directly to homes** and to a **local co\u2011op that sold them at a farmer\u2019s market**. The product was labelled \u201craw milk \u2013 not pasteurised\u201d. |\n| **Why it was especially risky** | \u2022 **High inoculum** \u2013 The final concentration (>10\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9) far exceeds the infectious dose for *Campylobacter* (as low as 500\u202fCFU for healthy adults, lower for children/pregnant people). <br>\u2022 **No kill step** \u2013 Pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) would have reduced the load by >5\u202flog units, essentially eliminating the pathogen. <br>\u2022 **Vulnerable consumers** \u2013 The farm\u2019s \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d model attracted families with young children who often drink the milk straight from the bottle. <br>\u2022 **Cold\u2011chain failure** \u2013 The cooler used was **not calibrated**; the milk spent 48\u202fh at a temperature that allowed the bacteria to multiply. <br>\u2022 **Lack of post\u2011sale testing** \u2013 The farm only performed **pre\u2011sale bulk\u2011tank testing** (once per week). The contamination occurred **between testing and sale**, a known \u201cwindow of vulnerability\u201d. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 **CDC** issued an **Epi\u2011X alert** to clinicians and labs. <br>\u2022 **Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS)** performed a **trace\u2011back investigation**, recalled all raw\u2011milk bottles from the farm, and temporarily shut down the operation. <br>\u2022 **FDA** placed the farm",

Federal \u201cbaseline\u201d \u2013 the **Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)** and **FDA** authority  \n\n| Requirement | Detail | Enforcement / Monitoring | How it addresses the outbreak risk |\n|-------------|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Prohibition of interstate sale of raw milk** | 21\u202fU.S.C.\u202f\u00a7\u202f342(g) makes it illegal to ship raw milk across state lines for human consumption. | FDA can seize shipments, issue warning letters, and bring civil actions. | Stops the *distribution* step that could turn a local problem into a multi\u2011state outbreak. |\n| **Adulteration definition** | Milk that **contains a pathogenic microorganism** that \u201cmay cause illness\u201d is *adulterated* and must not be marketed. | FDA can issue *Recall* or *Seizure* orders; the product must be removed from commerce. | Provides a legal basis for recalling contaminated batches (as happened in Wisconsin). |\n| **Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) for dairy** | 21\u202fCFR\u202f\u00a7\u202f110.30 requires **sanitary milking equipment, proper cooling, and temperature control**. | FDA inspections of *large\u2011scale* dairy plants (but *not* of most small\u2011farm raw\u2011milk operations, which are regulated by states). | Addresses milking\u2011line sanitation and refrigeration \u2013 two failure points in the case study. |\n| **Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) requirement** | All **pasteurised\u2011milk plants** must have a written HACCP plan (21\u202fCFR\u202f\u00a7\u202f123). Raw\u2011milk operations are *exempt* unless the state adopts HACCP for them. | FDA inspects HACCP compliance in pasteurised\u2011milk plants; states may require it for raw milk. | If applied to raw milk, it would force producers to identify *critical control points* (e.g., bulk\u2011tank temperature, post\u2011milking cleaning) and monitor them. |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:**  At the federal level, the **biggest safety lever is the ban on interstate commerce**; everything else (cGMP, HACCP) applies mainly to pasteurised\u2011milk plants, not to most small raw\u2011milk farms.\n\n---\n\n### 2. State\u2011level authority \u2013 the **real \u201cgatekeepers\u201d** for raw milk  \n\nIn the U.S. each state decides whether to **allow** raw\u2011milk sales and under what **conditions**.
