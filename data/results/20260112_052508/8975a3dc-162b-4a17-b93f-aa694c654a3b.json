      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurized milk \u2013 what the safety data actually say**\n\n| Aspect | Raw milk (un\u2011heated) | Pasteurized milk (heated) |\n|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| **How it\u2019s produced** | Milk is taken straight from the animal and sold without any heat treatment (or only a very mild \u201clow\u2011temperature long\u2011time\u201d (LTLT) warm\u2011hold). | Milk is heated to a specific temperature for a set time (e.g., 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 HTST, or 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin \u2013 LTLT) and then rapidly cooled. |\n| **Main safety goal** | Rely on animal health, farm hygiene, rapid cooling, and cold\u2011chain handling to keep bacterial load low. | Use heat to kill most disease\u2011causing bacteria and reduce overall microbial load. |\n| **Pathogen reduction** | No intentional kill step.  Studies consistently find **higher prevalence of pathogenic bacteria** in raw milk samples: <br>\u2022 *Salmonella* \u2013 0.5\u20132\u202f% of samples (vs. <0.1\u202f% after pasteurisation) <br>\u2022 *Campylobacter* \u2013 up to 1\u202f% of raw samples <br>\u2022 *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus* toxin\u2011producing strains are repeatedly isolated from raw milk. | Heat destroys >99.9\u202f% of vegetative pathogens.  The FDA/EFSA/WHO require a \u22655\u2011log (100,000\u2011fold) reduction of *C.\u202fperfringens* spores and a \u22656\u2011log reduction of *Listeria*, *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7.  Residual risk is therefore **extremely low** (\u22481 case per 10\u202fmillion gallons in the United States). |\n| **Typical outbreak data (U.S.)** | 1993\u20112022: 127 confirmed outbreaks linked to raw milk, causing 1,896 illnesses, 73 hospitalisations, 5 deaths (CDC).  Roughly 30\u202f% of all milk\u2011related outbreaks involve raw milk despite raw milk representing <1\u202f% of total milk sales. | 1993\u20112022: 17 outbreaks linked to pasteurised milk, causing 274 illnesses, 13 hospitalisations, 0 deaths.  The per\u2011serving risk is <0.001\u202f% of that for raw milk. |\n| **Vulnerable populations** | Infants, toddlers, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised people are **much more likely** to suffer severe disease from raw\u2011milk pathogens (e.g., meningitis, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome). | Same groups are protected because the pathogens are largely eliminated; the residual risk is comparable to that of other ready\u2011to\u2011eat foods. |\n| **Nutrient differences** | Small, often non\u2011significant differences: <br>\u2022 Slightly higher levels of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (B\u2011complex, vitamin C) \u2013 but milk is not a major source of these vitamins. <br>\u2022 Enzyme activity (e.g., alkaline phosphatase) remains, which some argue aids digestion, but scientific evidence of a health benefit is weak. | Heat destroys a few percent of heat\u2011labile vitamins and enzymes; however, the loss is minor compared with the overall nutrient profile of milk.  Pasteurisation does **not** affect protein quality, calcium, or most other nutrients. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Typically 7\u201110\u202fdays under refrigeration, but microbial growth can accelerate if cold chain breaks. | 14\u201121\u202fdays (or longer with ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) processing) because the initial bacterial load is far lower. |\n| **Regulatory stance (major agencies)** | \u2022 **U.S. FDA**: Raw milk may be sold only under \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d or \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d exemptions in some states; many states ban retail sales. <br>\u2022 **EFSA (EU)**: Raw milk is allowed only with strict hygiene rules and mandatory testing; many EU countries impose a \u201craw\u2011milk\u2011only\u201d label and restrict sales to on\u2011farm consumption. <br>\u2022 **WHO**: Recommends pasteurisation for public\u2011health safety; raw milk should be avoided by high\u2011risk groups. | \u2022 Universally permitted and the default standard for commercial milk. <br>\u2022 Mandatory pasteurisation (or equivalent heat treatment) in the U.S., EU",

It thrives at refrigeration temperatures, so even a well\u2011cooled bulk tank can harbor it if an infected animal is present.  \n- **Speed of detection** \u2013 Because the illness was severe enough to prompt a clinic visit, the outbreak was identified within a week, limiting the number of exposures.  In contrast, some raw\u2011milk outbreaks have gone undetected for weeks, leading to dozens of cases.  \n- **Outcome** \u2013 No deaths, but two hospitalisations (including a 4\u2011year\u2011old who required IV fluids).  The case\u2011fatality rate for raw\u2011milk\u2011linked Campylobacter outbreaks in the U.S. is \u22480.5\u202f%\u2014still higher than for pasteurised milk (\u22480\u202f%).  \n\n### If you still want to drink raw milk, what can you do to **lower** (but not eliminate) the risk?\n\n| Step | Why it helps | Practical tip |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Buy from a reputable source** | Farms that keep **strict herd\u2011health records**, perform **regular pathogen testing**, and have a **verified cold\u2011chain** are less likely to have contaminated milk. | Look for farms that post recent **negative test results** (e.g., monthly bulk\u2011tank cultures for *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Listeria*, *Campylobacter*) on a website",
