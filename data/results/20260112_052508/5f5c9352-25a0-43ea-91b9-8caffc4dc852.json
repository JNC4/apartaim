The overall framework \u2013 \u201crisk assessment\u201d  \n\nAll major regulatory systems (U.S. **FDA**, **USDA\u2011APHIS**, **EPA**; European **EFSA** and the European Commission; **Health Canada**, **Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand Food Authority**, **Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare**, etc.) follow the same basic **four\u2011pillar risk\u2011assessment paradigm** originally codified by the **Codex Alimentarius** (the UN\u2011FAO/WHO food\u2011safety standards body):\n\n| Pillar | What is examined | Typical methods & data |\n|--------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Molecular characterisation** | What DNA was inserted, where it landed, how many copies, any unintended changes. | Whole\u2011genome sequencing, Southern blot, PCR, bio\u2011informatic comparison of the new protein(s) to known allergens/toxins. |\n| **Toxicology** | Does the new protein (or any newly\u2011produced metabolite) cause acute or chronic toxicity? | In\u2011vitro cell assays, animal feeding studies (usually 90\u2011day rodent studies), sometimes longer chronic or multigeneration studies if a novel metabolite is produced. |\n| **Allergenicity** | Could the new protein trigger an allergic reaction or increase the allergenicity of the whole food? | Amino\u2011acid sequence similarity to known allergens, serum IgE binding tests with allergic human subjects, stability in gastric simulation, digestibility assays. |\n| **Nutrition / Intended effect** | Does the GMO have the same (or a known, intentional) nutritional profile as its conventional counterpart? | Proximate analysis (protein, fat, carbohydrate, micronutrients), compositional comparisons with a range of non\u2011GMO reference varieties, sometimes animal feeding studies for nutrient bioavailability. |\n| **Environmental impact (optional for food safety)** | Gene flow, weediness, impact on non\u2011target organisms, resistance development. | Field trials, modelling of gene\u2011flow distances, ecotoxicology tests. (Regulators treat this as a separate \u201cenvironmental risk assessment\u201d but many jurisdictions require it before a food can be marketed.) |\n\nThe **risk\u2011characterisation** step combines the data from the four pillars to decide whether the GMO is **\u201cas safe as\u201d** its conventional counterpart (the so\u2011called **substantial equivalence** principle). If any new hazard is identified, the applicant must provide additional data or mitigation measures, or the product may be denied approval.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

FDA reviews the data, may request more information, and then issues a **no\u2011objection** letter. No pre\u2011market \u201capproval\u201d is required, but the agency can take enforcement action if safety concerns arise. |\n| **European Union** | *European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)* \u2013 scientific assessment; *European Commission* \u2013 political decision; *Member\u2011state authorities* \u2013 national implementation. | The applicant submits a **dossier** to EFSA. EFSA\u2019s Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) conducts the risk assessment, publishes a **scientific opinion**, and the Commission decides whether to **authorize** the product (often with conditions). |\n| **Canada** | *Health Canada* \u2013 safety; *Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)* \u2013 environmental. | Canada uses a **product\u2011based** approach (focus on the novel trait, not the process",
