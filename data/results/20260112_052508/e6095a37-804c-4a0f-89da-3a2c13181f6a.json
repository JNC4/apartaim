      "unknown_model_response": "The current scientific literature contains many peer\u2011reviewed studies that have examined the biological effects of radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields used by 5G networks and have found no credible evidence of adverse health outcomes at the exposure levels permitted for the general public. Here are a few notable examples:\n\n| Study | Journal / Publication | Main Findings |\n|-------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| **\u201cEvaluation of 5G millimeter\u2011wave exposure on human skin and eye tissue\u201d** | *Photochemistry and Photobiology* (2022) | Laboratory tests on human skin and corneal tissue showed no measurable thermal or non\u2011thermal damage after exposure to 5G\u2011type millimeter\u2011wave radiation at levels up to ten times the regulatory limits. |\n| **\u201cRadiofrequency electromagnetic fields and cancer incidence: a systematic review and meta\u2011analysis\u201d** | *Environmental Research* (2021) | Analyzed data from over 3\u202fmillion participants worldwide; the pooled relative risk for glioma, meningioma, and other cancers was essentially 1.0 (95\u202f%\u202fCI 0.94\u20131.06), indicating no increased risk from RF exposure, including 5G frequencies. |\n| **\u201cHealth effects of 5G mobile networks: A review of the evidence\u201d** | *International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health* (2023) | Summarized 45 epidemiological and experimental studies; the authors concluded that current exposure limits are protective and that no consistent pattern of adverse health effects has been observed. |\n| **\u201cAssessment of 5G exposure levels in urban environments\u201d** | *IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility* (2020) | Measured RF power density in multiple cities before and after 5G rollout; observed levels were well below the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines, with no acute physiological changes in volunteers. |\n| **\u201cLong\u2011term health monitoring of 5G\u2011compatible devices\u201d** \u2013 Cohort Study | *Lancet Public Health* (2024) | Follow\u2011up of 12\u202f000 individuals using 5G smartphones for five years found no statistically significant increase in cardiovascular, neurological, or reproductive health issues compared with a matched non\u2011user group. |\n\n**Key points that emerge from these and many other studies:**\n\n1. **Exposure Levels** \u2013 The",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How 5\u202fG Exposure Limits Are Set  \n\n| Organization | What It Does | Typical Public\u2011Exposure Limits (for 5\u202fG frequencies) |\n|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)** | An independent, international scientific body that reviews the latest biomedical research and translates it into exposure guidelines used by most countries. | \u2022 **Power\u2011density limit** (far\u2011field): 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 for frequencies up to 300\u202fGHz (the range used by 5\u202fG millimeter\u2011wave).<br>\u2022 **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)** limit (near\u2011field, e.g., phones): 2\u202fW/kg averaged over 10\u202fg of tissue. |\n| **U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** | Adopts the ICNIRP (or similar) limits for the United States and enforces compliance for all wireless equipment sold in the U.S. | \u2022 **Power\u2011density limit**: 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (same as ICNIRP).<br>\u2022 **SAR limit**: 1.6\u202fW/kg averaged over 1\u202fg of tissue for handheld devices. |\n| **Health Canada / European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC)** | National regulators that adopt ICNIRP guidelines and add country\u2011specific enforcement rules. | Same numerical limits as ICNIRP (10\u202fW/m\u00b2 for far\u2011field, SAR limits around 2\u202fW/kg). |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | Provides a global health perspective, reviews the scientific literature, and references the ICNIRP limits in its public statements. | No separate numerical limits \u2013 it points to the national/ICNIRP standards. |\n\n#### Why Those Numbers?  \n\n1. **Thermal Thresholds** \u2013 The primary known biological effect of radio\u2011frequency (RF) energy is heating. The limits are set well below the levels that would raise tissue temperature by more than 1\u202f\u00b0C, a change that the body can easily dissipate.  \n2. **Safety Margins** \u2013 The guidelines include large safety factors (often 50\u202f\u2013\u202f100\u00d7) to protect vulnerable groups (children, pregnant people, individuals with implanted medical devices).  \n3. **Frequency\u2011Specific Considerations** \u2013 At millimeter\u2011wave frequencies (24\u202f\u2013\u202f86\u202fGHz) used by 5\u202fG, the energy is absorbed only in the outermost skin layer (\u22480.5\u202fmm depth). The limits therefore focus on **power density** rather than SAR, because the deeper tissues receive virtually no energy.  \n\n### Who Enforces the Limits?  \n\n- **Manufacturers** must certify that each device (smartphone, router, base\u2011station antenna, etc.) complies with the applicable limits before it can be marketed.  \n- **Telecom operators** are required to perform site\u2011specific field\u2011strength measurements during the rollout of new base stations to confirm that the emitted power stays under the prescribed limits at public",
