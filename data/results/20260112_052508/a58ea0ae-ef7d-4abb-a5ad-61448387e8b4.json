What QE actually does \u2013 the \u201cmechanical\u201d channels\n\n| Channel | What the central bank does | How it can affect different groups |\n|---------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Asset\u2011price channel** | Purchases large amounts of government bonds (and sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities). This pushes up the price of those securities and lowers their yields. | \u2022 **Asset owners** (high\u2011net\u2011worth households, pension funds, insurance companies) see the market value of their portfolios rise.<br>\u2022 **Non\u2011owners** (low\u2011income renters) receive little or no direct benefit. |\n| **Interest\u2011rate / credit\u2011cost channel** | By lowering yields on safe assets, QE drags down market interest rates (mortgages, auto loans, business borrowing). | \u2022 **Borrowers** (most middle\u2011class families with mortgages, small\u2011business owners) enjoy cheaper financing.<br>\u2022 **Savers** (especially older retirees who rely on interest income) earn less on bank deposits and low\u2011risk bonds. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Large purchases of domestic bonds increase the supply of the domestic currency in foreign\u2011exchange markets, often depreciating the currency. | \u2022 **Export\u2011oriented firms and workers** gain from a weaker currency that makes their goods cheaper abroad.<br>\u2022 **Import\u2011dependent consumers** (especially low\u2011income households that spend a larger share of income on food and energy) face higher import\u2011price inflation. |\n| **Expectations / \u201crisk\u2011taking\u201d channel** | QE signals that the central bank will keep policy accommodative for an extended period, which can lift risk appetite and encourage banks to lend to riskier borrowers. | \u2022 **Credit\u2011constrained households** (often low\u2011income) may gain access to new loans (e.g., for home purchase or small business).<br>\u2022 **Speculative investors** may channel the extra liquidity into higher\u2011risk assets, potentially inflating asset bubbles that later hurt the broad public. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011interaction channel** | By keeping borrowing costs low, QE reduces the government\u2019s interest\u2011payment burden, freeing fiscal space for spending or tax cuts. | \u2022 **All households** can benefit from any expansionary fiscal policy that follows (e.g., unemployment benefits, infrastructure jobs).<br>\u2022 The distributional impact depends on how the fiscal \u201cspace\u201d is used\u2014targeted transfers vs. tax cuts for the wealthy. |\n\n> **Key point:** QE does **not** directly hand money to households; its effects are mediated through markets, prices, and expectations.

The overall fall from 5.0\u202f% (pre\u2011QE) to 3.8\u202f% (post\u2011QE3) was 1.2\u202fpp; many borrowers who refinanced after QE3 captured the full 1.2\u202fpp.  The 0.5\u202fpp number is the *average* effect that can be cleanly isolated in a regression controlling for other macro variables (see Fed 2012 paper).  I present both the \u201cconservative\u201d 0.5\u202fpp case and the \u201cfull\u2011fall\u201d 1.2\u202fpp case later in the table.\n\n### 1.2  Mortgage\u2011payment formula  \n\nThe standard amortizing\u2011loan payment is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly payment } P = \\frac{r\\,L}{1-(1+r)^{-N}}\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(L\\) = loan principal ($300,000)  \n* \\(r\\) = monthly interest rate (annual rate \u00f7 12)  \n* \\(N\\) = total number of payments (360 for a 30\u2011yr loan).\n\n### 1.3  Compute the two payments  \n\n| Scenario | Annual rate | Monthly rate \\(r\\) | Monthly payment \\(P\\) | Annual debt\u2011service cost (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\(P\\)) |\n|----------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Before QE\u2011rate cut** | 4.5\u202f% | 0.045\u202f/\u202f12 = **0.00375** | \\(P = \\frac{0.00375 \\times 300{,}000}{1-(1+0.00375)^{-360}} = **\\$1,520.06**\\) | **$18,240.72** |\n| **After QE\u2011rate cut (\u20110.5\u202fpp)** | 4.0\u202f% | 0.040\u202f/\u202f12 = **0.0033333** | \\(P = \\frac{0.0033333 \\times 300{,}000}{1-(1+0.0033333)^{-360}} = **\\$1,432.25**\\) | **$17,187.00** |\n| **After full QE\u2011fall (\u20111.2\u202fpp)** | 3.3\u202f% | 0.033\u202f/\u202f12 = **0.00275** | \\(P = \\frac{0.00275 \\times 300{,}000}{1-(1+0.00275)^{-360}} = **$1,298.45**\\) | **$15,581.40** |\n\n#### 1.3.1  Monthly savings  \n\n| Reduction | Monthly saving | Percent of",
