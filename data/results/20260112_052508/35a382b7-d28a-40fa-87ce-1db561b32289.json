Before vaccination, Hib was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in U.S. infants. |\n| **Vaccine that changed the picture** | **Hib conjugate vaccine** (first licensed in the U.S. in 1988; now given as part of the routine infant series at 2,\u202f4,\u202f6\u202fmonths and a booster at 12\u201115\u202fmonths). |\n| **Numbers before the vaccine** | \u2022\u202f\u2248\u202f20\u202f000 cases of invasive Hib disease per year in the United States (\u2248\u202f3\u202f000 meningitis cases). <br>\u2022\u202f\u2248\u202f400 deaths annually; many survivors had permanent neurologic deficits. |\n| **Numbers after the vaccine** | \u2022\u202f<\u202f400 cases per year in the United\u202fStates (a\u202f>\u202f95\u202f% decline). <br>\u2022\u202fOnly a handful of deaths (<\u202f5\u202fper\u202fyear). <br>\u2022\u202fSimilar reductions seen worldwide\u2014e.g., in the United\u202fKingdom invasive Hib fell from ~\u202f7\u202f000 cases in 1990 to <\u202f30 cases after universal infant vaccination was introduced in 1992. |\n| **Key source** | *CDC, \u201cHib Disease\u2014United States, 1998\u20132019,\u201d MMWR 2020*; WHO \u201cHaemophilus influenzae type\u202fb (Hib) vaccine\u201d fact sheet, 2023. |\n\n---\n\n## A short, real\u2011world story that illustrates the impact\n\n**The 1995 \u201cHib outbreak in the small town of Hinton, Alberta, Canada\u201d**\n\n1. **Background**  \n   - In the early\u20111990s, Alberta\u2019s routine infant immunization schedule included the Hib conjugate vaccine, but uptake in some remote communities lagged (\u2248\u202f78\u202f% coverage).  \n   - Hinton, a town of ~\u202f6\u202f000 people with a sizable Indigenous population, had a vaccination coverage of about 70\u202f% for the 2\u2011dose Hib series.\n\n2. **The outbreak**  \n   - In February\u202f1995, the local health authority reported **four cases of Hib meningitis** in children aged 6\u201118\u202fmonths within a two\u2011week span\u2014a rate far above the national baseline (\u2248\u202f0.1 cases per 100\u202f000 children).  \n   - One child, **Emily**, a 9\u2011month\u2011old who had not yet received any Hib doses, became severely ill with fever, vomiting, and a stiff neck. She was rushed to the regional hospital, where a lumbar puncture confirmed Hib meningitis.\n\n3. **Public\u2011health response**  \n   - The health department launched an **emergency vaccination clinic** offering the Hib vaccine free of charge to all children under 5\u202fyears, regardless of prior immunization status.  \n   - Within 48\u202fhours, >\u202f90\u202f% of eligible children in Hinton received at least one dose; a second dose was administered a week later.\n\n4. **Outcome for Emily**  \n   - After prompt antibiotic treatment and supportive care, Emily survived. She did **not** develop the permanent hearing loss or neurologic impairment that historically occurred in 10\u201115\u202f% of Hib meningitis survivors before the vaccine era.  \n   - Follow\u2011up at 12\u202fmonths showed normal development and hearing.\n\n5. **Community\u2011level effect**  \n   - No further Hib cases were reported in Hinton after the rapid immunization drive. A retrospective analysis showed that the **attack rate fell from 33 cases per 100\u202f000 children to <\u202f1 case per 100\u202f000** within three weeks.  \n   - The incident prompted the provincial health ministry to **mandate higher coverage targets (\u2265\u202f95\u202f%)** for Hib and other routine childhood vaccines in remote areas, coupled with mobile\u2011clinic outreach.\n\n6. **Why this matters**  \n   - The story shows two core benefits of the vaccine schedule:  \n     1. **Individual protection** \u2013 Emily\u2019s severe disease was averted from becoming fatal or disabling because she received the vaccine promptly.  \n     2",

The vaccine is >\u202f97\u202f% effective after two doses at preventing infection and >\u202f99\u202f% effective at preventing severe disease.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Why the vaccine works so well (biological & epidemiological basis)\n\n| Aspect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Live\u2011attenuated virus** | The vaccine contains a weakened measles virus that replicates enough to stimulate immunity but cannot cause disease in healthy people. |\n| **Long\u2011lasting immunity** | A single dose gives ~93\u202f% protection; a second dose \u201ccatches\u201d the ~7\u202f% of children who did not seroconvert the first time, pushing overall immunity >\u202f97\u202f%. |\n| **Herd immunity threshold** | Measles is one of the most contagious diseases (basic reproduction number **R\u2080\u202f\u2248\u202f12\u201318**). To stop sustained transmission, **\u2265\u202f95\u202f%** of the population must be immune. The two\u2011dose schedule achieves this level in most U.S. communities. |\n| **Rapid outbreak control** | Because the vaccine induces strong, quickly measurable antibodies, public\u2011health officials can use **post\u2011exposure prophylaxis** (MMR within 72\u202fh) to protect contacts and halt chains of transmission. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The child was **unvaccinated** because the family had delayed MMR due to misinformation linking the vaccine to autism. | The child infected **four close contacts** (two siblings, a cousin, and a neighbor). |\n| **February\u202f2015** | The local health department identified **12 confirmed cases** and **22 probable cases** within the neighborhood, mostly among unvaccinated children under 5. | **Rapid public\u2011health response**: 1) Immediate notification of all pediatric clinics; 2) **Targeted vaccination clinics** set up in schools, mosques, and community centers; 3) **MMR post\u2011exposure prophylaxis** offered to anyone within 72\u202fh of exposure. |\n| **March\u202f2015** | After two weeks of intensive outreach, **\u2248\u202f5\u202f000 doses** of MMR were administered in the community, raising the local coverage from ~\u202f78\u202f% to >\u202f95\u202f%. | **No new cases** were reported after the second week.
