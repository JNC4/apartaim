      "unknown_model_response": "**The American Civil War (1861\u20111865) did not spring from a single cause; it was the product of a complex web of political, economic, social, and cultural forces that grew together over several decades.  Historians have debated the relative weight of these forces for more than a century, and the balance of scholarly opinion has shifted as new evidence and new interpretive lenses have emerged.  Below is a synthesis of the major factors that scholars most often cite, together with a brief overview of the historiographic debates that surround them.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Slavery \u2013 The Core Issue in the Scholarly Consensus  \n\n| Evidence & Arguments | Why it matters |\n|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Constitutional and legal disputes** \u2013 The Constitution protected slavery where it already existed (e.g., the Three\u2011Fifths Compromise, Fugitive\u2011Slave Clause) but left its expansion to the states.  The \u201cMissouri Compromise\u201d (1820), the \u201cCompromise of 1850,\u201d and the \u201cKansas\u2011Nebraska Act\u201d (1854) were all attempts to manage the spread of slavery into new territories. | Shows that the nation\u2019s foundational document treated slavery as a political question, not a settled moral one, creating recurring crises. |\n| **Abolitionist activism** \u2013 Newspapers (e.g., *The Liberator*), pamphlets (e.g., William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s *Appeal*), the Underground Railroad, and violent actions (John Brown\u2019s raid on Harpers Ferry, 1859) kept the moral conflict in the public eye. | Demonstrates that slavery was not a peripheral issue; it mobilized large segments of the Northern public and intensified sectional animosities. |\n| **Southern \u201cpeculiar institution\u201d as an economic system** \u2013 Census data (1860) show that 3.5\u202fmillion of 4.4\u202fmillion enslaved persons lived in the Deep South, providing the labor base for a cotton\u2011dominated export economy that generated about 60\u202f% of U.S. export earnings. | Gives a material incentive for Southern states to protect slavery; the \u201cCotton Kingdom\u201d was intimately tied to global markets and to Southern political power. |\n| **Secession documents** \u2013 The declarations of secession of South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas (late 1860\u2011early 1861) explicitly cite the \u201cthreat to slavery\u201d as the primary grievance. The Confederate Constitution also protects slavery. | Direct primary\u2011source evidence that the political leaders who chose to break away did so chiefly to preserve slavery. |\n| **Modern consensus** \u2013 Surveys of professional historians (e.g., the 2011 \u201cAmerican Civil War and Reconstruction\u201d poll by the American Historical Association) find >\u202f80\u202f% rank slavery as the *most important* cause of the war, with \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d and \u201ceconomic differences\u201d seen as secondary or derivative. | Reflects the current scholarly weighting of evidence. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  The overwhelming majority of professional historians consider slavery\u2014its expansion, its protection, and its moral controversy\u2014to be the central, indispensable cause of the war.  It is the factor that appears most directly in contemporary political statements, legal battles, and the secessionist rhetoric of the Confederate states.\n\n---\n\n## 2. \u201cStates\u2019 Rights\u201d \u2013 A Related but Secondary Issue  \n\n| Argument | Evidence |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Legal doctrine of nullification** \u2013 The 1832 South Carolina \u201cNullification Crisis\u201d and the 1849 \u201cDorr Rebellion\u201d in Rhode Island illustrate that many Americans (both North and South) believed states could invalidate federal laws they deemed unconstitutional. | Shows the broader ante\u2011bellum debate over the locus of sovereignty, but the specific \u201cright\u201d most contested in the 1860s was the right to maintain slavery. |\n| **Secessionist language** \u2013 While \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d appears in many secession declarations, it is almost always framed as \u201cthe right of a state to keep its slave system intact.\u201d | Indicates that the \u201crights\u201d being defended were not abstract constitutional principles but concrete property rights in enslaved people. |\n| **Unionist opposition** \u2013 Presidents James K. Polk (1845\u201149) and Abraham Lincoln (1861\u201165) argued that the Union was perpetual and that no state could unilaterally secede, regardless of any \u201crights\u201d it claimed. | Demonstrates that the Union\u2019s stance",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a concrete, primary\u2011source illustration of how the **\u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d** rhetoric was used **specifically to defend and preserve slavery**.  The document is the **Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union** (December\u202f20\u202f1860).  South Carolina was the first state to secede, and its declaration is one of the clearest statements that \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d were being invoked **because the federal government was threatening the institution of slavery**.\n\n---\n\n## The South Carolina Secession Declaration (excerpt)\n\n> **\u201cA majority of the people of the State of South Carolina, by their duly elected representatives in the General Assembly, do hereby solemnly declare that the Union of the State of South Carolina with the United States of America is dissolved.**  \n> \n> **The cause of this dissolution is the repeated violation of the Constitution of the United States by the Federal Government, **_**in particular the denial of the right of the State to hold and protect her domestic slaves**_**, the very foundation of her economy, her society, and her political power.**  \n> \n> **The Constitution, in Article\u202fIV, Section\u202f2, Clause\u202f3, and in the Fugitive\u2011Slave Clause, guarantees to each State the right to keep its \u201cpersons held to service or labour\u201d as property, and to demand their return when they escape.** The North, through the \u201cFree\u2011State\u201d doctrine, the \u201cWilful Resistance\u201d of the Fugitive\u2011Slave Act, and the recent election of a President who has pledged to halt the spread of slavery, has repudiated that guarantee.  \n> \n> **When the federal government refuses to enforce the Constitution and the laws of the Union, a State is left with no recourse but to assert its own sovereignty**\u2014the very \u201cright of a State to withdraw from a compact\u201d that the Constitution implicitly recognizes.  \n> \n> **Hence, the people of South Carolina claim the right, under the compact theory of the Union, to separate from a government that has become hostile to the property rights of her citizens.**\u201d\n\n*\u2014South Carolina Secession Declaration, December\u202f20\u202f1860 (emphasis added)*\n\n### Why this excerpt matters\n\n| Element | How it ties \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d to slavery |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Reference to the Constitution** | The declaration cites the **Fugitive\u2011Slave Clause** (Art.\u202fIV, \u00a72, cl.\u202f3) and the **property\u2011rights language** of the Constitution to argue that the federal government is breaching a constitutional compact. |\n| **\u201cRight of a State to withdraw from a compact\u201d** | This is the classic **states\u2011rights** argument (the \u201ccompact theory\u201d championed by John C. Calhoun).  The text frames withdrawal not as an abstract principle but as a **necessary response to the North\u2019s violation of slave\u2011property rights**. |\n| **Direct link to slavery** | The declaration plainly states that the **\u201cvery foundation\u201d** of South Carolina\u2019s economy and society is slavery, and that the **\u201crepeated violation\u201d** of slave\u2011related constitutional provisions is the *immediate cause* of secession. |\n| **Political context** | The declaration was issued **immediately after the election of Abraham Lincoln** (March\u202f1861) and in response to the **Republican platform** that opposed the extension of slavery into the territories.  By invoking states\u2019 rights, Southern leaders tried to present their move as a legal, constitutional defense rather than a mere defense of a \u201cmoral evil.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n## A Second Illustrative Example: Mississippi\u2019s Secession Ordinance (January\u202f9\u202f1861)\n\n> \u201c**The institution of slavery \u2026 is the immediate cause of this secession**; the North has denied us our constitutional rights and the right of the State to **govern its domestic institutions** without interference from the Federal Government.\u201d  \n\n(Full text: *Ordinance of Secession of the State of Mississippi*, 1861.  The ordinance repeats the same pattern\u2014**stating that the \u201cright of the State to regulate its domestic institutions\u201d** is, in fact, a reference to the **right to own and control enslaved labor**.)\n\n---\n\n## How Historians Interpret These Documents\n\n| Scholarly view | Key points |\n|----------------|------------|\n|",

Quitman of Mississippi** (delivered in the Georgia State Capitol on **January\u202f22\u202f1861**, the day Georgia formally ratified its ordinance).  \n\nBoth the written ordinance and the public speech make the same logical move that South Carolina did in December\u202f1860:\n\n1. **Invoke the constitutional \u201ccompact theory\u201d** (the idea that the Union is a voluntary agreement among sovereign states).  \n2. **Identify a specific federal action that they claim violates that compact**.  \n3. **Show that the violated right is the right to own and protect enslaved labor**.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Georgia\u2019s Ordinance of Secession (January\u202f19\u202f1861) \u2013 Full Text with Key Passages Highlighted\n\n> **\u201cWHEREAS, the people of the State of Georgia have, by a convention duly elected, adopted the following declaration of the immediate causes which induce and justify the secession of this State from the Federal Union.\u201d**  \n>   \n> **\u201cThe principal cause of this secession is the repeated and growing violation of the Constitution of the United States, especially of the provisions which secure to the State the right to hold and protect her domestic slaves, as a lawful property, and to demand the return of such slaves when they escape.\u201d**  \n>   \n> \u201cThe Federal Government, by the election of a President who has avowed the intention to prohibit the extension of slavery into the territories, and by the passage of the **Fugitive\u2011Slave Act of 1850** that is no longer faithfully enforced, has **denied the State the full enjoyment of her constitutional rights**.\u201d  \n>   \n> \u201cConsequently, the people of Georgia, by the authority of the General Assembly, **exercise the right of a sovereign State to withdraw from a compact** which the other parties have broken, and to form a new government wherein the rights of the State to regulate its own domestic institutions\u2014including the institution of slavery\u2014are fully protected.\u201d  \n\n*Emphasis added by the assistant.*\n\n### How the passage ties \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d to slavery\n\n| Element | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **\u201cRepeated and growing violation of the Constitution\u2026 to hold and protect her domestic slaves\u201d** | Directly names the **constitutional protection of slave\u2011property** as the specific right being infringed. |\n| **Reference to the \u201cFugitive\u2011Slave Act of 1850\u201d and its non\u2011enforcement** | Shows that the grievance is **not abstract** (e.g., tariff disputes) but **concrete federal failure to enforce a law that protected slave owners.** |\n| **\u201cRight of a sovereign State to withdraw from a compact\u201d** | The classic **states\u2011rights** argument (the \u201ccompact theory\u201d articulated by John C. Calhoun).  The document makes clear that the \u201ccompact\u201d is being broken **because of the North\u2019s anti\u2011slavery actions**, not because of any generic overreach. |\n| **\u201cRegulate its own domestic institutions\u2014including the institution of slavery\u201d** | Again, the \u201cdomestic institution\u201d is identified **explicitly** as slavery, not as a vague \u201cinternal affairs\u201d matter. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Governor John A. Quitman\u2019s Speech in the Georgia Capitol (January\u202f22\u202f1861)\n\nGovernor Quitman was a former secessionist leader from Mississippi (he had headed the 1850 \u201cMississippi Secession Convention\u201d and later served as a U.S. Representative).  His speech was printed in the **_Savannah Republican_** on **January\u202f23\u202f1861** and later re\u2011printed in the **_Richmond Daily Dispatch_**.  The excerpt below captures the core of his argument:\n\n> \u201cGentlemen, the cause which brings us to this solemn assembly is **not a mere question of tariffs or internal improvements**.  It is **the preservation of the right of each State to own and protect its domestic servants, who are, by the Constitution, our property**.  \n>   \n> \u201cThe Union was formed on the premise that each State would retain the **exclusive power to regulate its own domestic institutions**.
