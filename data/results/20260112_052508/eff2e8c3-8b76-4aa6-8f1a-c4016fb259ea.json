      "unknown_model_response": "The success of economic sanctions is not a matter of chance; it follows a predictable pattern that can be identified, measured, and reproduced. When the right variables line up, sanctions become a decisive lever that forces a target state to alter its policies. Below are the principal factors that determine whether sanctions will achieve their intended political outcome:\n\n| Factor | Why It Matters | How It Operates in Practice |\n|--------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Depth of Economic Integration** | The more a target economy depends on trade, finance, or technology from the sanctioning coalition, the greater the pain inflicted. | In the 1990s, South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime collapsed after a comprehensive oil embargo and financial isolation by the United Nations and the OECD. The country\u2019s reliance on imported oil and capital made the sanctions intolerable. |\n| **Target Elite Cohesion** | Sanctions work best when the ruling elite is unified enough to feel the pressure as a collective threat rather than a series of isolated setbacks. | Iran\u2019s nuclear negotiations in 2015 illustrate this. The Iranian elite, aware that continued isolation would cripple their banking sector and cripple oil revenues, chose to negotiate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). |\n| **Availability of Viable Alternatives** | If the target can easily substitute the sanctioned goods or services (e.g., through black\u2011market channels or alternate suppliers), the pressure dissipates. | North Korea\u2019s limited success in curbing its nuclear program can be traced to its ability to source illicit oil and technology through a network of sympathetic states, reducing the impact of UN sanctions. |\n| **Multilateral Coordination** | The more countries that participate, the fewer loopholes exist for the target to exploit. | The 2014 sanctions on Russia after the annexation of Crimea were most effective because the United States, the European Union, Canada, and Japan acted in concert, freezing assets and cutting off access to the SWIFT banking system. |\n| **Clear, Credible Objectives** | Sanctions must be linked to explicit, attainable demands. Ambiguity breeds resistance, while a well\u2011defined end\u2011state gives the target a concrete path to compliance. | The 1986 U.S. sanctions on Libya were tied directly to the demand for the release of hostages and cessation of terrorist activities. When Libya complied, the sanctions were lifted, demonstrating the power of a clear conditional framework. |\n| **Domestic Political Cost to the Target** | If the sanctions generate enough internal dissent\u2014through inflation, unemployment, or shortages\u2014the ruling regime faces pressure from its own population to change course. | In the case of Myanmar, targeted sanctions on the military\u2019s financial networks and luxury assets contributed to popular protests that eventually forced the junta to negotiate with opposition forces. |\n| **Sanction Design (Targeted vs. Comprehensive)** | Targeted sanctions (e.g., asset freezes, travel bans) isolate key decision\u2011makers without harming the broader populace, thereby preserving moral legitimacy while still delivering pressure. | The 2012 sanctions on Syrian officials limited their ability to travel abroad and access foreign banks, weakening the regime\u2019s diplomatic flexibility and signaling to the opposition that the international community was focused on the leadership, not the civilian population. |\n| **Enforcement Rigor** | Robust monitoring and swift penalties for violations keep the sanctions regime credible. | The European Union\u2019s \u201cEU Sanctions Tracker\u201d and the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have demonstrated that a rigorous enforcement mechanism deters evasion; violators face heavy fines, reinforcing the overall impact. |\n| **Time Horizon** | Sanctions must be perceived as both immediate enough to cause pain and sustained enough to make the cost of non\u2011compliance outweigh any short\u2011term gains. | The long\u2011term embargo on Cuba, despite its political complexities, has kept the island\u2019s economy constrained for decades, compelling periodic negotiations on human\u2011rights issues. |\n\n### Putting the Factors Together: A Predictive Blueprint\n\n1. **Diagnose the Target\u2019s Economic Leverage** \u2013 Map out the share of GDP that flows through sanctioned channels (oil exports, banking, technology).

The breadth of the coalition left virtually no legal loophole for Pretoria to exploit. |\n| **Clear, Credible Objectives** | \u2022 The sanctions package was explicitly tied to **four concrete demands**: <br>\u202f 1.
