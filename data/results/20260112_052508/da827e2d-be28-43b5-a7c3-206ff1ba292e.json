      "unknown_model_response": "Vaccines, like all medicines, continue to be monitored for safety after they are licensed and begin to be used in the general population. In the United States, several coordinated systems work together to detect, assess, and respond to any adverse events that might be associated with vaccination. Here\u2019s an overview of how post\u2011licensure safety monitoring works:\n\n### 1. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)\n- **What it is:** A national, passive reporting system co\u2011managed by the CDC and the FDA.\n- **How it works:** Health\u2011care providers, manufacturers, and anyone (including patients or parents) can submit reports of any health problem that occurs after vaccination, regardless of whether the problem is believed to be caused by the vaccine.\n- **Purpose:** VAERS serves as an early\u2011warning system to flag potential safety signals that merit further investigation.\n\n### 2. V-safe\n- **What it is:** A smartphone\u2011based, active surveillance program run by the CDC.\n- **How it works:** After a vaccine is administered, recipients (or parents of child recipients) are invited to enroll in v\u2011safe. They receive periodic text messages or emails asking about any symptoms or health issues they\u2019ve experienced.\n- **Purpose:** Provides real\u2011time, structured data on common side effects (e.g., fever, soreness) and helps identify patterns that might not be captured through passive reporting alone.\n\n### 3. Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project\n- **What it is:** A network of physicians and researchers at academic medical centers who evaluate complex or serious adverse events that may be related to vaccination.\n- **How it works:** When a clinician encounters a puzzling case, they can request a CISA consult. The team reviews the medical record, conducts a detailed assessment, and may perform additional testing.\n- **Purpose:** Offers expert, case\u2011by\u2011case analysis to determine whether a vaccine is likely involved and to improve clinical guidance.\n\n### 4. FDA\u2019s Post\u2011Marketing Surveillance (PMS) and the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) System\n- **What it is:** The FDA\u2019s active surveillance infrastructure, which includes data from large health\u2011care databases, insurance claims, and electronic health records.\n- **How it works:** Using sophisticated statistical methods, the FDA continuously monitors these data for any increase in specific health outcomes among vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated controls.\n- **Purpose:** Detects rare adverse events that may only become apparent when millions of doses have been administered.\n\n### 5. The Sentinel Initiative\n- **What it is:** A national electronic\u2011health\u2011record system that the FDA uses to monitor the safety of a broad range of medical products, including vaccines.\n- **How it works:** Sentinel can rapidly query data from participating health systems to assess whether a particular safety signal is real and how large its impact might be.\n- **Purpose:** Provides rapid, large\u2011scale evaluation of potential safety concerns.\n\n### 6. International Collaboration\n- **World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS):** Reviews safety data from around the world and issues guidance.\n- **Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD):** A collaboration between the CDC and several large health\u2011maintenance organizations that conducts active surveillance studies on vaccine safety.\n\n---\n\n## How Signals Are Evaluated\n\n1. **Signal Detection:** An unusual pattern (e.g., a higher-than-expected number of a specific adverse event) is identified through one of the systems above.\n2. **Signal Validation:** Researchers examine the data to rule out reporting",

Public\u2011health authorities and manufacturers continue to collect data on **all** adverse events that occur after immunisation, looking especially for **rare** or **delayed** reactions that could not be detected in the pre\u2011licensure trials (which, even for the largest Phase\u202fIII studies, usually involve\u202f\u2264\u202f30\u202f000 children).

      "unknown_model_response": "### Example: The Measles\u2011Mumps\u2011Rubella (MMR) Vaccine  \n\n**Background**  \nThe combined measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR) vaccine was first licensed in the United States in 1971 (as a single\u2011antigen measles vaccine) and the combined formulation was introduced in 1978. Because it protects against three highly contagious viral diseases, it quickly became a cornerstone of the routine childhood immunization schedule (first dose at 12\u201115\u202fmonths, second dose at 4\u20116\u202fyears).\n\n**Post\u2011Licensure Safety Monitoring**\n\n| Monitoring System | What It Did for MMR | Key Findings |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| **VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)** | Collected >\u202f100,000 reports involving MMR since its introduction. The system flagged a small number of reports of febrile seizures, rash, and arthritic complaints, which are known, mild, and self\u2011limited reactions. | No unexpected serious adverse events were identified. The rate of febrile seizures (\u2248\u202f1\u202f\u2013\u202f2 per\u202f10,000 doses) matched expectations from pre\u2011licensure studies. |\n| **V\u2011Safe** (active surveillance, launched in 2015) | Enrolled thousands of parents of children receiving MMR. Daily text\u2011based questionnaires captured common side\u2011effects such as fever, sore arm, and mild rash. | 92\u202f% of participants reported no serious problems; the most common symptoms were low\u2011grade fever (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of children) and mild soreness at the injection site. |\n| **Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)** | Conducted large cohort studies linking electronic health\u2011record data from >\u202f10\u202fmillion children. Researchers compared rates of serious outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, autoimmune disease) in MMR\u2011vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children. | No increased risk of hospitalization, autism, inflammatory bowel disease, or other serious conditions was found. The relative risk for all evaluated outcomes hovered around 1.0 (no difference). |\n| **Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project** | Reviewed individual cases of suspected severe reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, encephalitis) after MMR. | Confirmed that true anaphylaxis was exceedingly rare (<\u202f1 per\u202fmillion doses) and that reported encephalitis cases were coincidental infections unrelated to the vaccine. |\n| **FDA\u2019s BEST (Biologics Effectiveness and Safety) System & Sentinel Initiative** | Analyzed nationwide claims data for millions of children who received MMR between 1995\u20112020. | Detected no safety signal for rare neurologic events (e.g., Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome) beyond background rates. |\n| **WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS)** | Reviewed worldwide data, including large surveillance programs in Europe, Asia, and Africa. | Consistently concluded that the benefit\u2011risk profile of MMR remains overwhelmingly favorable; no new safety concerns emerged. |\n\n**What the Data Showed**\n\n1. **Rare Serious Reactions** \u2013 The incidence of true anaphylaxis after MMR is about 1 per\u202fmillion doses, which is comparable to many other routine childhood vaccines and far lower than the risk of severe disease from measles, mumps, or rubella infection.\n\n2. **Febrile Seizures** \u2013 A modest, transient increase in febrile seizures occurs when the first dose is given, especially if the child receives the measles component together with other live vaccines (e.g., varicella). The risk is well\u2011characterized (\u2248\u202f1\u20112 per\u202f10,000 doses) and is not associated with long\u2011term neurologic damage.\n\n3. **No Link to Autism or Autoimmune Disorders** \u2013 Multiple large\u2011scale cohort studies (VSD, BEST, Sentinel) have repeatedly shown no statistical association between MMR and autism spectrum disorder, type\u202f1 diabetes, or other autoimmune conditions.\n\n4. **Overall Safety Profile** \u2013 Over 50\u202fyears of use, millions of children have received MMR with a safety profile that matches, and in many respects exceeds, the expectations set during pre\u2011licensure trials.\n\n**Why This Example Matters**\n\nThe MMR vaccine illustrates how the U.S. (and global) post\u2011licensure safety infrastructure works in practice:\n\n- **Rapid detection** of any unexpected pattern (via VAERS and V\u2011Safe).  \n- **Rigorous",
