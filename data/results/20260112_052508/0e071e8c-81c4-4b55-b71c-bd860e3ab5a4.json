QE is a \u201csecond\u2011round\u201d tool meant to lower longer\u2011term rates and support credit. | \u2022 Prices of the assets purchased rise (yields fall). <br>\u2022 The sellers of those assets (banks, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors) receive cash that they can redeploy. |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing channel** \u2013 the cash that sellers get is used to buy other assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate, foreign assets). | To push down rates across the whole spectrum, not just on the assets the central bank buys. | \u2022 Broad\u2011based rise in asset prices (equities, housing, corporate bonds). <br>\u2022 Lower borrowing costs for firms and households (mortgages, business loans). |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3  **Signalling channel** \u2013 the announcement that the central bank will keep rates low for a long time influences expectations about future inflation and growth. | To shape expectations and encourage spending/investment. | \u2022 Expectations of higher future inflation can reduce the real return on savings, encouraging consumption. |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3  **Liquidity / \u201cbank\u2011runway\u201d channel** \u2013 banks receive additional reserves, which can (but do not always) translate into more lending. | To keep the banking system well\u2011capitalised and avoid a credit crunch. | \u2022 In practice, the effect on *new* loan growth is modest in many episodes (see the \u201cbank\u2011lending\u201d debate below). |\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The macro\u2011economic story most economists agree on\n\n| Consensus point | Evidence |\n|-----------------|----------|\n| **QE lowers long\u2011term interest rates** (government\u2011bond yields, mortgage rates, corporate\u2011bond yields). | Empirical studies (e.g., Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack 2011; Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens & Tong 2011) estimate a drop of 30\u201180\u202fbp in the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield per $1\u202ftrillion of QE in the U.S. |\n| **QE raises the price of a wide range of assets** (equities, housing, corporate bonds). | Event\u2011study analyses around QE announcements show sizeable positive abnormal returns for stocks (+3\u20115\u202f% on announcement days) and higher house\u2011price growth in the following quarters. |\n| **QE supports aggregate demand** by making borrowing cheaper and by lifting wealth (the \u201cwealth effect\u201d). | Macro\u2011models (e.g., New Keynesian DSGE with a financial accelerator) generate a short\u2011run boost of 0.5\u20111\u202f% of GDP per $1\u202ftrillion of QE; real\u2011world estimates vary but are generally positive. |\n| **The inflation\u2011targeting goal is usually achieved** \u2013 QE has not caused runaway inflation in the major advanced\u2011economy cases (U.S., Eurozone, UK, Japan). | Inflation stayed close to target (\u22482\u202f%) or even below it in many QE episodes, despite large balance\u2011sheet expansions. |\n\nThese points form the **scientific consensus**: QE works as a monetary\u2011policy tool that lowers long\u2011term rates and lifts asset prices, and it can help economies that are stuck in a low\u2011inflation, low\u2011growth equilibrium.  \n\nWhat remains **controversial** is **how those macro effects are distributed across different households, firms, and sectors**, and **whether the transmission to the real economy (investment, hiring) is as strong as the asset\u2011price effects**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Who **gains** from QE? \u2013 Distributional arguments\n\n| Group | Mechanism of gain | Empirical evidence |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Borrowers** (mortgage owners, firms with debt, student\u2011loan borrowers) | Lower nominal interest rates on loans; lower refinancing costs. | U.S. mortgage rates fell \u224830\u201140\u202fbp after each QE round; corporate bond spreads narrowed by ",

A concrete \u201chome\u2011owner\u201d illustration  \n\nBelow is a **simple back\u2011of\u2011the\u2011envelope calculation** that shows how a typical mortgage payment can fall after a QE\u2011induced drop in long\u2011term rates.  \n\n| Parameter | What we assume | Why this is plausible after a QE round |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Loan amount (principal)** | **$300,000** (a common mortgage size in the U.S.) | QE pushes 30\u2011year Treasury yields down; mortgage rates usually track those yields plus a risk spread. |\n| **Original interest rate** | **4.50\u202f%** (annual nominal) | This was the average 30\u2011yr fixed\u2011rate mortgage (FRM) in the U.S. in early\u20112022, before the most recent QE announcements. |\n| **New interest rate after QE** | **4.00\u202f%** (a 0.50\u2011percentage\u2011point decline) | Empirical studies find that each $1\u202ftrillion of QE in the U.S. lowered the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield by roughly 30\u201140\u202fbp; mortgage rates move roughly one\u2011to\u2011one with the Treasury yield plus a small spread, so a 0.5\u202f% drop is realistic after a sizable QE round. |\n| **Loan term** | **30 years (360 months)** | Standard amortizing mortgage. |\n| **Monthly payment formula** | \u202f\\(P = \\frac{r\\,L}{1-(1+r)^{-N}}\\)  where \\(r\\) = monthly rate, \\(L\\) = loan amount, \\(N\\) = number of months. | Standard amortization. |\n\n### 1.1  Payment before QE (4.50\u202f%)\n\n* Monthly rate \\(r_{old}=4.5\\%/12 = 0.375\\% = 0.00375\\)  \n* \\(P_{old}= \\frac{0.00375 \\times 300,000}{1-(1+0.00375)^{-360}} \\approx \\$1,520\\)\n\n### 1.2  Payment after QE (4.00\u202f%)\n\n* Monthly rate \\(r_{new}=4.0\\%/12 = 0.3333\\% = 0.003333\\)  \n* \\(P_{new}= \\frac{0.003333 \\times 300,000}{1-(1+0.003333)^{-360}} \\approx \\$1,432\\)\n\n### 1.3  The difference\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Monthly saving** | **\u2248 $88** |\n| **Annual saving** | **\u2248 $1,060** |\n| **Savings over the first 5\u202fyears** (ignoring tax effects) | **\u2248 $5,300** |\n| **Present\u2011value of the stream of savings** (discounted at 3\u202f% real) | **\u2248 $4,200** |\n\n> **Interpretation:** A homeowner who refinances (or whose existing loan\u2019s rate is automatically reset, as with an adjustable\u2011rate mortgage) would see a noticeable reduction in cash\u2011flow, freeing up roughly 5\u202f% of their monthly budget.  That extra money can be spent on consumption, saved, or used to pay down other debt.\n\n*If the homeowner cannot refinance (e.g., because of credit\u2011score limits, high closing\u2011costs, or a fixed\u2011rate loan that cannot be modified), the benefit is indirect: the overall housing\u2011price market tends to rise when QE lifts asset prices, increasing home\u2011equity values (see the \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d section below).*\n\n---\n\n## 2.

How QE reaches renters and non\u2011owners \u2013 the transmission chain  \n\n### 2.1  The \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d channel (indirect)\n\n1. **Central bank buys $800\u202fbn of Treasuries** \u2192 Treasury yields fall (e.g., 10\u2011yr yield drops from 2.0\u202f% to 1.6\u202f%).  \n2. **Mortgage rates follow** (as shown in the homeowner example) \u2192 Homeowners refinance, freeing cash.  \n3. **Homeowners (now with extra cash) may**  \n   * **Buy a second property** \u2192 Increases demand for existing\u2011home sales, pushing up home prices.  \n   * **Invest in upgrades** \u2192 Improves the supply of higher\u2011quality rental units (good for renters).  \n   * **Pay down other debts** \u2192 Improves their credit, which can make landlords more willing to accept lower rent or offer flexible lease terms.  \n\n**Result for renters:** The *supply* side of the rental market can become slightly cheaper if landlords\u2019 financing costs fall enough to offset the higher demand for housing. In practice, the effect is modest and highly local (big\u2011city markets with tight rents see more upward pressure).\n\n### 2.2  The \u201csignalling\u201d channel (expectations)\n\n* QE signals that the central bank expects **inflation to be near target** and **growth to be supported** for an extended period.  \n* Workers anticipate a **more stable macro\u2011environment**, which can reduce \u201cprecautionary savings\u201d and encourage them to spend or accept jobs.  \n* **Wage negotiations** may incorporate the expectation of a \u201clooser\u201d monetary stance, leading to modest wage gains, especially in sectors that are labour\u2011intensive (retail, hospitality).  \n\n**Result for renters:** Higher wages \u2192 more ability to meet rent payments, but the effect is usually **small** (average wage growth in QE episodes is 0.2\u20110.4\u202f% per quarter).\n\n### 2.3  The \u201cliquidity / bank\u2011runway\u201d channel  \n\n* Banks receive reserves, but the **increase in new loan supply** is uneven. In the U.S. after the 2008\u201109 QE rounds, **new mortgage originations rose by about 15\u201120\u202f%** in the first year, but **commercial\u2011real\u2011estate (CRE) lending** grew faster than consumer credit.  \n* **For renters:** If banks are more willing to lend to landlords for **buy\u2011to\u2011let** purchases, the supply of rental units can expand, putting downward pressure on rents.  \n\n**Caveat:** In many advanced",
