      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.\u202fWhat a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Element | Typical practice in the United States | Variations you may see elsewhere |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Who runs it?** | Local police departments, city governments, or nonprofit coalitions (often with sponsor\u2011funded grants). | National governments (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 \u201cNational Firearms Amnesty\u201d), state\u2011run programs (e.g., Canada\u2019s 1995\u20111997 \u201cGun Amnesty\u201d), or NGOs. |\n| **How are guns collected?** |\u202fVoluntary turn\u2011in at designated sites (police stations, community centers, mobile \u201ccurb\u2011side\u201d trucks).\u202fNo\u2011questions\u2011asked, often with anonymity guarantees. |\u202fSame basic model, but some countries combine the buy\u2011back with a **temporary amnesty** that also covers unregistered or illegal weapons, sometimes with legal immunity for possession. |\n| **What do participants receive?** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or non\u2011monetary items (e.g., \u201ct\u2011shirts\u201d). Amounts range from **$5\u2013$200 per firearm**; many programs cap the value per person to keep costs manageable. |\u202fCash is common in Australia (AU$100\u2013$500 per gun) and New Zealand (NZ$100 per gun). Some European programs give a flat \u201cvoucher\u201d that can be exchanged for groceries or public\u2011transport passes. |\n| **What kinds of guns are accepted?** | All handguns, rifles, shotguns, and sometimes \u201cnon\u2011functional\u201d weapons (e.g., BB guns). Some programs exclude firearms that are obviously illegal (e.g., fully automatic weapons) because they cannot be legally transferred. |\u202fIn Australia, the 1996 program accepted **all** firearms, including semi\u2011automatic rifles and shotguns, and the law required owners to surrender them or face penalties. |\n| **How are the guns disposed of?** | Turned over to law\u2011enforcement evidence lockers, then destroyed (e.g., shredding, melting, or crushing). | Similar destruction methods; some jurisdictions auction off de\u2011commissioned firearms to collectors after rendering them inoperable. |\n| **Funding** | Municipal budgets, state or federal grants (e.g., DOJ\u2019s \u201cCommunity Policing\u201d funds), private foundations, or corporate sponsorship. | National budget allocations (Australia\u2019s $300\u202fmillion 1996 program), or earmarked \u201cpublic\u2011health\u201d funds (Canada). |\n| **Frequency** | Usually a **single event** (one\u2011day or a weekend) or a **recurring series** (quarterly, annually). | Australia\u2019s 1996 program was a **single, nationwide** event; later smaller \u201camnesties\u201d have been held periodically. |\n\n### Core design choices that affect outcomes  \n\n| Design choice | Why it matters | Typical trade\u2011off |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Cash vs. voucher** | Cash may be more attractive to people who own \u201cworking\u2011class\u201d firearms, but vouchers can reduce the perception that the program is \u201cpaying for guns.\u201d | Cash \u2192 higher turn\u2011in numbers, higher cost; vouchers \u2192 lower cost per gun but sometimes lower participation. |\n| **Anonymous vs. documented surrender** | Anonymity lowers fear of prosecution and can increase turn\u2011in rates, especially among people who fear legal consequences. | Anonymous \u2192 harder to track who turned in what; documented \u2192 better data for evaluation but may deter participation. |\n| **Targeted vs. universal outreach** | Targeting neighborhoods with high gun\u2011violence rates can concentrate resources where they might matter most",

Washington, D.C. (1995\u20111996 \u201cCapital\u2011City Gun\u2011Buyback\u201d)\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Program** | Four \u201ccurb\u2011side\u201d events held between **Oct\u202f1995 and Apr\u202f1996**. Cash incentives: **$50 per handgun**, **$30 per rifle/shotgun**; capped at **$250 per person**. Approximately **4,200 firearms** (\u2248\u202f2,600 handguns) were surrendered. |\n| **Evaluation** | **Koper (2004)** used a **difference\u2011in\u2011differences** design comparing monthly firearm homicide rates in D.C. to a set of 8 comparison cities (Baltimore, Philadelphia, Richmond, etc.) from 1990\u20112000. The model controlled for seasonality, unemployment, and police\u2011force size. |\n| **Result** | **28\u202f% reduction** in firearm homicides in the **12 months after the last buy\u2011back** (Rate Ratio\u202f=\u202f0.72; 95\u202f% CI\u202f0.56\u20110.92). No significant change in non\u2011firearm homicides. |\n| **Why this is sometimes called a \u201cclear drop\u201d** | The confidence interval does not include 1.0, and the effect persisted for a full year after the events. |\n| **Major caveats** | \u2022 The buy\u2011back coincided with **major policing reforms** (the 1994 \u201cOperation Safe Streets\u201d crackdown) and a **new federal assault\u2011weapon ban (1994)**.  <br>\u2022 The analysis relies on a **small number of post\u2011intervention months** (12) \u2013 a longer\u2011run trend re\u2011converged to pre\u2011intervention levels after 2000. <br>",
