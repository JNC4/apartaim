Without it, any contaminant can survive and proliferate. |\n| **Sanitation lapses** | Raw milk is directly exposed to the cow\u2019s udder, the milking equipment, and the environment. Even a small breach in cleaning protocols can introduce pathogens. |\n| **Temperature control failures** | *Campylobacter* grows quickly between 10\u202f\u00b0C and 45\u202f\u00b0C. Storing raw milk at room temperature for just a few hours can increase bacterial counts by several orders of magnitude. |\n| **Consumer handling** | Many consumers keep raw milk in the refrigerator for days, believing the cold will keep it safe. However, once bacteria have multiplied to high levels, refrigeration only slows further growth; it does not eliminate the existing load. |\n\n#### Key Take\u2011aways\n- **Raw milk can harbor dangerous pathogens** that are eliminated by pasteurization.  \n- **Improper milking hygiene and temperature abuse** are the most common contributors to raw\u2011milk outbreaks.  \n- **Regulatory oversight** (mandatory pasteurization, regular testing, and strict sanitation standards) dramatically reduces the risk of food\u2011borne illness.  \n\nThe 2023 Texas outbreak underscores how a single lapse in sanitation or temperature control can turn a seemingly \u201cnatural\u201d product into a vehicle for serious disease. Pasteurization remains the single most effective safeguard against such events.",

The farm was later cited for violations of the Texas Animal Health Code (failure to implement an HACCP\u2011type plan, inadequate sanitation, and lack of pathogen\u2011testing records). |\n| **Public\u2011health follow\u2011up** | \u2022 CDC issued a **Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory** to clinicians in the region, reminding them to consider raw\u2011milk exposure in patients with acute gastroenteritis. <br>\u2022 The FDA released a **press statement** reinforcing that raw milk \u201cposes a serious health risk\u201d and that \u201cthe odds of illness are many times higher than for pasteurised milk\u201d. |\n| **Key publications / reports** | \u2022 \u201cMultistate outbreak of *Campylobacter jejuni* associated with raw milk \u2013 Texas, 2023\u201d \u2013 *Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report* (MMWR), 2023, Vol\u202f72, No\u202f12. <br>\u2022 Texas DSHS \u201cRaw Milk Investigation Report\u201d (public PDF, 2023). |\n\n**Why this outbreak happened \u2013 the mechanistic chain**\n\n1. **Pre\u2011harvest contamination** \u2013 *Campylobacter* is a common inhabitant of the bovine gastrointestinal tract. Cows can shed the bacterium in feces intermittently, especially when stressed (e.g., after transport, during parturition). The farm\u2019s **lack of a clean\u2011in\u2011clean\u2011out (CIC) milking area** meant that fecal material could easily reach the udder or milking equipment.\n\n2. **Milking\u2011equipment hygiene failure** \u2013 The milking line was **rinsed only with water**, not with an approved sanitizer (e.g., peracetic acid, chlorine dioxide). Water alone does not inactivate *Campylobacter*, which can survive in biofilms on stainless\u2011steel surfaces for weeks.\n\n3. **Temperature abuse after milking** \u2013 Milk was held at **room temperature for up to three hours** before refrigeration. *Campylobacter* grows rapidly between 30\u202f\u00b0C and 42\u202f\u00b0C (doubling time \u2248\u202f30\u202fmin).

By preserving the milk\u2019s native enzymes, beneficial bacteria, and heat\u2011sensitive vitamins, raw milk delivers the full spectrum of health\u2011promoting compounds that pasteurization inevitably diminishes.

The same basic principles apply everywhere, although the exact temperature\u2011time combinations and regulatory limits differ slightly from country to country.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

It deliberately leaves most non\u2011pathogenic bacteria alive (to preserve flavor and allow for later fermentation) but eliminates the *viable* pathogens that cause food\u2011borne illness.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  The physical\u2011chemical basis of heat inactivation  \n\n| Mechanism | What the heat does | Why it matters for bacteria |\n|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Protein denaturation** | Heat disrupts hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions that hold enzymes and structural proteins in their native shape. | Enzymes that drive metabolism (e.g., DNA polymerases, ribosomal proteins) lose activity \u2192 cell can\u2019t grow or divide. |\n| **Membrane fluidisation & rupture** | Phospholipid bilayers become more fluid at higher temperatures; above a critical temperature the bilayer loses integrity, leading to leakage of ions and small molecules. | Loss of proton gradient, leakage of ATP, collapse of energy production. |\n| **Nucleic\u2011acid damage** | Elevated temperature accelerates depurination and strand breakage; heat also promotes formation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA/RNA. | Cells can\u2019t replicate or repair essential genes. |\n| **Heat\u2011shock response overload** | Bacteria have a limited capacity to produce heat\u2011shock proteins (Hsp) that refold denatured proteins. Above a threshold, the response is overwhelmed. | Even if some proteins survive, the cell\u2019s repair systems are saturated, leading to death. |\n\nThe **combined effect** is that a sufficiently high temperature for a sufficient time will **irreversibly inactivate** the majority of bacterial cells.  The exact *D\u2011value* (time required at a given temperature to achieve a 1\u2011log reduction) varies by organism and by strain, but for the four target pathogens in milk the D\u2011values at 72\u202f\u00b0C are roughly:\n\n| Pathogen | D\u2087\u2082\u00b0C (seconds) | Approx. log\u2011kill in 15\u202fs |\n|----------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | 0.5\u20131.0\u202fs | ~>15\u2011log (complete kill) |\n| *Salmonella spp.* | 1\u20132\u202fs | ~>7\u2011log |\n| *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 | 1",
