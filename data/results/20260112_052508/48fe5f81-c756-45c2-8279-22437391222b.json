Heating** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for **15\u202fseconds** (\u00b1\u202f2\u202fs) while the milk flows through a thin\u2011walled stainless\u2011steel plate\u2011heat\u2011exchanger. | \u2022 **Protein denaturation** \u2013 enzymes that keep the cell alive (e.g., DNA\u2011polymerases, metabolic enzymes) unfold irreversibly.<br>\u2022 **Membrane disruption** \u2013 the phospholipid bilayer loses fluidity, causing leakage of cytoplasmic contents.<br>\u2022 **DNA/RNA damage** \u2013 heat accelerates depurination and strand breakage, especially in the presence of low\u2011pH micro\u2011environments inside the cell. | *C.\u202fjejuni* has a D\u2011value (time to achieve a 1\u2011log = 90\u202f% kill) of ~0.5\u20131\u202fmin at 60\u202f\u00b0C. Raising the temperature to 72\u202f\u00b0C cuts the D\u2011value to **\u2248\u202f0.02\u202fs** (the time needed to kill 90\u202f% of the cells). In 15\u202fs the theoretical log\u2011reduction is **>\u202f7\u202flog**, i.e., >99.99999\u202f% of the inoculated bacteria are destroyed. |\n| **2. Holding** (the 15\u202fs \u201chold\u201d is built into the plate\u2011heat\u2011exchanger) | The milk stays at the target temperature for the full 15\u202fs as it travels through the narrow channel (\u2248\u202f2\u202fmm gap). | Guarantees that *every* milk particle experiences the same temperature for the same time, eliminating \u201ccold spots.\u201d | Even a small clump of *C.\u202fjejuni* that might have been protected by fat globules is exposed long enough for heat to penetrate. |\n| **3. Rapid cooling** | 4\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F) within **\u2264\u202f30\u202fseconds** using a secondary heat\u2011exchanger. | Stops any further heat\u2011induced chemical changes (e.g., Maillard browning) and **prevents heat\u2011injured bacteria from repairing**. | Cold shock also *inactivates* many psychrotrophic spoilage organisms that survived the heat (they are already stressed). |\n| **4. Homogenisation (optional)** | Some plants homogenise after pasteurisation (pressure \u2248\u202f15\u202fMPa). | Breaks fat globules into smaller droplets, **reducing the surface area where bacteria could hide** and improving product stability. | Not a microbial kill step, but it helps keep the milk uniformly safe. |\n\n### Why the heat \u201cworks\u201d for *all* the usual culprits\n\n| Pathogen | Typical HTST log\u2011reduction (\u2265\u202f5\u202flog) | Reason it is reliably killed |\n|----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| *Salmonella* spp. | 5\u20136\u202flog | Heat\u2011sensitive cell wall + enzymes; D\u2011value at 72\u202f\u00b0C \u2248\u202f0.05\u202fs |\n| *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 | 5\u20136\u202flog | Similar to *Salmonella*; no heat\u2011resistant spores |\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | 5\u20136\u202flog | Even though it can grow at refrigeration temps, it is not heat\u2011resistant |\n| *Campylobacter jejuni* | >\u202f7\u202flog (practically complete) | Very low D\u2011value; cannot survive 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs |\n| *Mycobacterium avium* subsp. *paratuberculosis* (MAP) | \u2248\u202f5\u202flog (controversial) | Some studies suggest a few MAP cells may survive; however, MAP is not considered a major acute\u2011illness pathogen in humans. |\n| Bacterial spores (e.g., *Bacillus* spp.)",
