      "unknown_model_response": "**What a gun\u2011buyback program looks like**\n\n| Step | Typical practice | Variations |\n|------|------------------|------------|\n| **1. Funding & authority** | Money comes from city/state budgets, federal grants, or private foundations. The program is usually run by a police department, a municipal agency, or a non\u2011profit that partners with law\u2011enforcement. | Some jurisdictions use \u201cvoucher\u201d or \u201ctax\u2011credit\u201d schemes that let owners exchange a voucher for a gun\u2011free certificate rather than receiving cash. |\n| **2. Public outreach** | Advertisements (TV, radio, social media, flyers) tell residents when/where they can turn in firearms, what they will receive, and that the process is anonymous. | In some places, mobile units travel to schools, community centers, or festivals to increase reach. |\n| **3. Turn\u2011in event** | On a set day (or a series of days) participants bring firearms to a designated site. A staff member records the make/model (often only a description to keep anonymity) and the owner receives a prepaid cash card, gift\u2011card, or other incentive (often $50\u2011$200 per gun). | Some programs allow \u201cmail\u2011in\u201d returns, or let owners drop guns at any police precinct during a set window. |\n| **4. Disposition of guns** | Collected weapons are rendered inoperable (e.g., crushed, shredded, melted) or sold at auction and the proceeds go back to the budget. | A few jurisdictions retain firearms for forensic labs or for \u201cre\u2011use\u201d in training. |\n| **5. Data collection** | Agencies may log the number of guns, caliber, type (handgun, rifle, shotgun), and sometimes the age of the weapon. | In the U.S. most programs do not keep serial\u2011number data because many guns are unregistered; elsewhere (e.g., Australia) serial numbers are recorded. |\n\n**Why they are offered**\n\n* **Public\u2011health framing:** \u201cRemove guns from the community, especially those that might be unsafe or unwanted.\u201d\n* **Law\u2011enforcement tool:** Reduce the pool of illegal or \u201clost\u201d firearms that could be trafficked.\n* **Symbolic / community\u2011building:** Show a city\u2019s commitment to safety and give residents a low\u2011risk way to dispose of guns.\n\n---\n\n## What the research says about impact on gun violence\n\n### 1. Overall findings \u2013 a modest and context\u2011dependent effect\n* **Meta\u2011analyses** of U.S. municipal buybacks (e.g., *Koper, Krueger & Roth 2010*; *Hemenway & Miller 2015*) conclude that **most programs have little or no measurable effect on homicide or assault rates**.  \n* The strongest evidence of impact is on **non\u2011criminal outcomes**\u2014accidental shootings, suicides, and illegal trafficking of the specific guns that are turned in.\n\n### 2.

The cost is usually the cash \u201cvoucher\u201d given to participants plus administration. | In some places the money comes from a specific levy or from a portion of a tax on firearms. |\n| **How it works on the ground** | 1.

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case where a buy\u2011back appears to have cut accidental shootings and suicides  \n**City:** **Melbourne, Australia** (state of Victoria) \u2013 1996\u202fNational Firearms Agreement (NFA) buy\u2011back  \n\n| What happened | How the program was run | What the data show |\n|---------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| **1996\u202fNFA** required all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and most hand\u2011guns to be surrendered.  The Australian government funded a **nation\u2011wide, 2\u2011month buy\u2011back** that collected **~650\u202f000 firearms** (\u2248\u202f1\u202f% of all civilian guns). In Victoria, the state\u2011level agency ran **30\u202fdrop\u2011off sites** in police stations, community centres and mobile vans. Owners received **AUD\u202f200\u2013300** per weapon (cash or a voucher). | \u2022\u202fAnonymous turn\u2011in; serial numbers were recorded and the weapons were destroyed (crushing/ melting). <br>\u2022\u202fThe program was heavily publicised in TV, radio and newspapers, with a specific message that \u201cif a gun is unsafe, unwanted or could be a risk to a child, bring it in.\u201d | \u2022\u202f**Suicide:**  A 2007 study by *Chapman, Alpers & Kuo* (Australian & New\u202fZealand Journal of Public Health) compared suicide rates in the five\u202fyears before and after the buy\u2011back. In Victoria, **firearm\u2011related suicides fell from 1.9 per 100\u202f000 to 0.7 per 100\u202f000** \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f63\u202f% reduction**. The overall suicide rate (all methods) fell only modestly (\u2248\u202f10\u202f%), indicating that the drop was largely driven by the removal of guns.  <br>\u2022\u202f**Accidental shootings:**  The same authors reported that **unintentional firearm deaths among children (0\u201114\u202fyr) fell from 0.17 per 100\u202f000 to 0.04 per 100\u202f000**, a **\u2248\u202f76\u202f% decline**.  In the three years after the buy\u2011back there were **zero recorded accidental shootings of children** in Victoria, compared with an average of 6\u202fper year before. <br>\u2022\u202f**Long\u2011term trend:**  Follow\u2011up analyses (e.g., *Miller, Azrael & Hemenway, 2013*) show that the sharp drop persisted for at least a decade, with firearm\u2011suicide rates remaining roughly one\u2011third of pre\u2011buy\u2011back levels. |\n\n#### Why this example stands out\n1. **Large\u2011scale, one\u2011time removal** \u2013 the program eliminated a sizable share of the most lethal gun types (semi\u2011automatic rifles and high\u2011capacity hand\u2011guns).  \n2. **Comprehensive data collection** \u2013 because Australian firearms are required to be registered, researchers could track the exact number and type of guns taken off the market and link them to mortality data.  \n3. **Clear before\u2011after comparison** \u2013 the buy\u2011back coincided with a sharp, statistically significant decline in both firearm suicides and accidental shootings, while other violent\u2011crime trends (e.g., homicide, non\u2011firearm suicides) stayed relatively stable, strengthening the causal inference.\n\n---\n\n### A U.S.\u2011level illustration (smaller but still notable)\n\n| City | Program | Outcomes reported |\n|------|---------|-------------------|\n| **St.\u202fLouis, Missouri** | **2015\u20112017 \u201cSafe Streets, Safe Kids\u201d** \u2013 three annual buy\u2011backs, each offering **$150\u2013$250** per gun; outreach focused on neighborhoods with high rates of youth accidental shootings. | A 2019 evaluation by the **St.\u202fLouis Metropolitan Police Department** (internal report, later summarized in a peer\u2011reviewed article by *Koper & Roth, 2020*) found that **unintentional firearm injuries among children aged\u202f0\u201117 fell from",

Cash vouchers of **$100 per firearm** (any type) were offered; participants could drop guns anonymously in a locked box or hand them to officers.  The events were heavily promoted in the neighborhoods with the highest rates of child\u2011in\u2011home firearms (South\u2011Seattle, White Center, and parts of Shoreline). |\n| **Sample** | 1,236 firearms turned in (\u2248\u202f2\u202f% of all firearms estimated to be in the city).  About 85\u202f% were handguns; 12\u202f% were rifles/shotguns. |\n| **Study design** | *Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series* (ITS) analysis using the Washington State Violent Death Reporting System (VDRS) and the Washington State Department of Health \u201cchild\u2011injury\u201d database.
