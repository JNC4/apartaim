      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise overall economic efficiency, but the benefits and costs are unevenly distributed across workers, industries, and time\u2011frames.  In most studies the net effect on a country\u2019s *average* worker is modestly positive, while a sizable minority of workers\u2014especially those in import\u2011competing sectors or low\u2011skill occupations\u2014experience job loss, wage pressure, or a need to retrain.  The magnitude of these outcomes depends on the country\u2019s economic structure, the design of the agreement (e.g., labor\u2011rights clauses, \u201crules of origin,\u201d safeguards), and the strength of complementary policies such as unemployment insurance, trade\u2011adjustment assistance, and active labour\u2011market programmes.\n\nBelow is a balanced synthesis of the main strands of evidence, organized by **what tends to happen**, **who is most affected**, **why the results differ**, and **what policy levers can shape the outcomes**.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
