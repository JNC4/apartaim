A Wi\u2011Fi router, by contrast, usually radiates only a few hundred milliwatts. The difference is roughly an order of magnitude (10\u2011to\u201120\u202f\u00d7) in favor of the small cell being stronger, but the absolute power is still low compared with many everyday RF sources (e.g., a cordless phone base station, a Bluetooth headset, or a microwave oven).\n* **Frequency matters:** Higher frequencies (e.g., 28\u202fGHz mmWave) experience much greater free\u2011space path loss than lower frequencies (e.g., 3.5\u202fGHz). Consequently, a mmWave small cell must be placed closer to users to achieve the same coverage, but it also means the signal attenuates more quickly with distance.\n* **Antenna directionality:** Small\u2011cell antennas are often sectorized (covering 90\u00b0\u2013120\u00b0 slices) and may have gain that boosts the EIRP while focusing energy in a specific direction. Wi\u2011Fi antennas are usually omnidirectional or only mildly directional.\n\n---\n\n### How Close Can You Stand and Still Be Within Safety Limits?\n\nRegulatory bodies (e.g., the U.S. Federal Communications Commission \u2013 FCC, the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection \u2013 ICNIRP) set **exposure limits** based on the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and power density. For frequencies used by 5G (roughly 0.7\u202fGHz\u202f\u2013\u202f100\u202fGHz), the limits are:\n\n| Frequency | Power\u2011density limit (general public) |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------|\n| 0.7\u202f\u2013\u202f6\u202fGHz | **10\u202fW/m\u00b2** (ICNIRP) |\n| 6\u202f\u2013\u202f300\u202fGHz | **10\u202fW/m\u00b2** (ICNIRP) \u2013 same numerical value, but the biological interaction mechanisms differ at higher frequencies |\n\n**Estimating a \u201csafe distance\u201d**\n\nA quick back\u2011of\u2011the\u2011envelope calculation using the inverse\u2011square law gives a practical sense of distance.

      "unknown_model_response": "### Beamforming\u202f\u2014\u202fWhat It Is and How It Works\n\n**Beamforming** is a signal\u2011processing technique used by modern cellular base stations (including 5G small cells) and by many smartphones. Instead of radiating power uniformly in all directions, the antenna array can **steer a narrow \u201cbeam\u201d of radio\u2011frequency (RF) energy toward a specific device**. The key ideas are:\n\n| Step | What Happens | Why It Matters for Exposure |\n|------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **1. Antenna array** | A small cell has many individual antenna elements (often 8, 16, 32 or more) packed together. | Each element can be driven with a slightly different phase and amplitude. |\n| **2. Phase\u2011shifting** | The base\u2011station controller adjusts the phase of the signal fed to each element so that the emitted waves **constructively interfere** in the direction of the target device and **destructively interfere** elsewhere. | Energy is concentrated where it is needed, reducing wasted power and interference. |\n| **3. Dynamic steering** | As the phone moves, the base station continuously recalculates the optimal phase pattern and updates it many times per second (often > 100\u202fHz). | The beam \u201cfollows\u201d the phone, keeping the link strong while the average power radiated into the surrounding space stays low. |\n| **4. Narrow beamwidth** | At higher frequencies (e.g., 28\u202fGHz mmWave) the wavelength is only a few millimetres, so a modest\u2011size array can produce beams that are only a few degrees wide. | The energy is highly localized; people standing a few metres to the side receive only a fraction of the transmitted power. |\n\nIn practice, the base\u2011station software decides **how much power to put into the beam** based on the phone\u2019s signal\u2011to\u2011noise requirements. If the phone has a good line\u2011of\u2011sight and is close, the tower can use a **lower transmit power** while still maintaining a high data rate.\n\n---\n\n### Does Beamforming Change Your Exposure When You Hold a Phone Nearby?\n\n1. **Phone\u2011to\u2011tower link dominates the exposure**  \n   - When you are using a 5G phone, the **largest RF exposure for you** comes from the phone itself, not from the tower. Modern phones transmit at a few hundred milliwatts (often <\u202f200\u202fmW) and, because the antenna is right next to your head/hand, the **local SAR (Specific Absorption Rate)** is what safety standards regulate.  \n   - The tower\u2019s beam is aimed *at* the phone, not at you. By the time the beam reaches you, its power density has already dropped dramatically with distance (inverse\u2011square law) and with the intentional side\u2011lobe suppression built into the beamforming algorithm.\n\n2. **Power is \u201con\u2011demand\u201d**  \n   - Beamforming is **adaptive**: the tower only delivers the amount of power needed to maintain the link. If you move farther away or the channel becomes noisy, the tower may increase its EIRP modestly, but it will never broadcast at its maximum continuous power unless absolutely required.  \n   - This \u201con\u2011demand\u201d behavior means that the **average exposure** from a small cell is typically far below the regulatory limits, even when you are standing directly beneath it.\n\n3. **Regulatory safety limits are respected**  \n   - Both the FCC (U",

By adjusting the **phase** and **amplitude** of the signal fed to each element, the array creates constructive interference in one direction and destructive interference elsewhere. | The total radiated power is the same as the sum of the elements, but it is **concentrated** into a narrow \u201cbeam\u201d that points only where a device needs it. |\n| **Digital beam steering** | The network\u2019s base\u2011band processor calculates, every few milliseconds, where each user\u2019s handset is (using uplink pilots, timing advance, angle\u2011of\u2011arrival, etc.) and then tells the antenna array to \u201cpoint\u201d a beam at that location. | Beam width for sub\u20116\u202fGHz is typically **5\u201115\u00b0** (a few metres at 10\u202fm distance). For mm\u2011wave the beam can be **1\u20113\u00b0** (a few centimetres at the same distance). | A person standing a few metres away who is **not** the target of the beam receives only the *side\u2011lobe* or *back\u2011lobe* power, which is usually **\u201120\u202fdB** (1\u202f%) or less of the main\u2011lobe power. |\n| **Time\u2011division of the beam** | A single antenna array can serve many users by **rapidly switching** the beam from one handset to the next, often many thousands of times per second. | The dwell time on any one user is on the order of **micro\u2011 to milliseconds** per transmission burst. | The **average** exposure at a fixed point is the sum of many very short bursts, each far below the instantaneous limit. |\n| **Power control** | The network continuously measures the signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio (SNR) reported by the handset and **lowers** the transmit power if the link is good, **raises** it only enough to keep the error\u2011rate below a target (e.g., 10\u207b\u2075). | Typical downlink power for a handset 5\u202fm from the small cell may be **10\u201130\u202fmW** (\u201120\u202fdBm) per carrier; at 30\u202fm it may rise to **\u2248\u202f200\u202fmW** (\u20117\u202fdBm). | The base\u2011station never radiates the maximum allowed EIRP all the time; the **actual** radiated power is often **<\u202f1\u202f%** of the regulatory ceiling. |\n\n### Visual picture (textual)\n\n1. **Idle / idle\u2011state** \u2013 No active users \u2192 the array emits a very low \u201cbeacon\u201d signal (typically \u2264\u202f0.1\u202fW EIRP) just to let phones know the cell exists.  \n2. **User appears** \u2013 The handset sends an uplink request. The base\u2011station measures the angle and distance, then **forms** a narrow down\u2011link beam that sweeps across the handset for a few milliseconds while data is sent.  \n3. **Data burst ends** \u2013 The beam is turned off or redirected to the next user. The handset may be receiving many such bursts per second, but each burst is short and low\u2011power.  \n\nBecause the **beam is only on while data is actually being transferred**, the **time\u2011averaged** power density at a fixed spot (e.g., a person standing under the antenna) is the sum of many tiny fractions of the peak beam power.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
