Why sanctions are used \u2013 the basic logic**\n\n| Step | What the sanction\u2011imposer hopes will happen | Typical tools |\n|------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **a. Create a cost** | By cutting off trade, finance, or investment the target\u2019s economy (or a key sector of it) loses revenue, jobs, or access to needed inputs. | Export bans, asset freezes, secondary (third\u2011party) restrictions, SWIFT/financial\u2011system exclusions |\n| **b. Generate political pressure** | The economic pain is expected to translate into political pressure on the decision\u2011makers who are responsible for the objectionable behaviour. | Lobbying of elites, public\u2011opinion shocks, rival factions within the regime |\n| **c. Incentivise a policy change** | If the cost of staying the course exceeds the benefit of the behaviour, the target will alter that behaviour (e.g., stop a weapons program, release prisoners, change election rules). | Conditional \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d offers, diplomatic negotiations that tie relief to compliance |\n| **d. Signal resolve / punish** | Even when the behaviour does not change, sanctions can serve as a diplomatic signal that the international community disapproves and is willing to act. | Symbolic bans, naming\u2011and\u2011shaming, unilateral or multilateral statements |\n\nThe *theoretical* chain is therefore:\n\n**Sanctions \u2192 Economic loss \u2192 Domestic political cost \u2192 Policy change**  \n\n(Or, in a more limited version, **Sanctions \u2192 International isolation \u2192 Regime\u2019s willingness to negotiate**.)\n\n---\n\n**2. How sanctions are supposed to work \u2013 mechanisms identified by scholars**\n\n| Mechanism | How it is expected to affect the target | Key empirical indicators |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Financial\u2011access restriction** | Cuts off external financing, raises borrowing costs, limits ability to import critical technology. | Changes in sovereign bond spreads; reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI). |\n| **Trade disruption** | Reduces export revenues (especially for commodity\u2011dependent states) and deprives the regime of foreign\u2011exchange earnings. | Decline in export volumes/value; lower GDP growth. |\n| **Asset freezing / confiscation** | Directly removes wealth from elites or state institutions, creating personal stakes in compliance. | Net loss of elite\u2011controlled assets abroad; changes in elite net\u2011worth. |\n| **Secondary effects** | Third\u2011party firms avoid the target to protect their own market access, amplifying the primary sanction\u2019s reach. | Number of foreign firms exiting; \u201cde\u2011risking\u201d of correspondent banking. |\n| **Domestic political shock** | Economic pain can erode regime legitimacy, embolden opposition or intra\u2011elite rivals. | Protest frequency; elite defections; changes in public opinion polls (where available). |\n| **Signaling / reputational cost** | International isolation can reduce a regime\u2019s ability to secure diplomatic support or future aid. | Reduction in diplomatic visits, voting alignment in international bodies. |\n\n---\n\n**3. What the empirical literature says**\n\n### 3.1 Meta\u2011analyses (broad quantitative surveys)\n\n| Study | Sample & Method | Main finding | Caveats |\n|-------|----------------|--------------|---------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007) \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*** | 221 cases (1970\u20112005) coded for *type*, *unilateral vs. multilateral*, *target\u2019s political system*, *objective clarity* | **\u224834\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their *explicit* political goals; success rose to **\u224855\u202f%** when sanctions were **multilateral, targeted, and had a clear, limited objective**. | Binary \u201csuccess/failure\u201d coding oversimplifies outcomes; many \u201cpartial successes\u201d are omitted. |\n| **Drezner (2011) \u2013 *The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions*** | Event\u2011study of 96 sanction episodes (1970\u20112005) using trade\u2011flow data | **No systematic effect",
