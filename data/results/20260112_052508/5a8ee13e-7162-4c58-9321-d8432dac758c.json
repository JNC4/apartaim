      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** \u2013 the large\u2011scale purchase of government bonds (and sometimes other securities) by a central bank \u2013 is a policy tool that was used most intensively after the 2008\u201109 financial crisis and again during the COVID\u201119 pandemic.  \nIts primary macro\u2011economic goals are to:\n\n1. **Lower long\u2011term interest rates** (by pushing up the price of the assets the central bank buys).  \n2. **Raise the price of financial assets** (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate) through \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d effects.  \n3. **Support credit\u2011creation** by encouraging banks to lend to the private sector.  \n\nBecause these channels operate through the financial system, the benefits and costs are not shared evenly across households and firms. Below is a systematic overview of the **distributional pathways**, the **empirical evidence**, the **main arguments on each side**, and the **remaining uncertainties**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main Transmission Channels and Who They Reach\n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical \u201cwinners\u201d | Typical \u201closers\u201d or exposed groups |\n|---------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **1a. Lower borrowing costs** (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, business loans) | QE pushes down yields on Treasuries and other benchmark rates; banks pass part of the reduction to borrowers. | Households with variable\u2011rate debt (e.g., mortgage borrowers), small\u2011business owners needing loans, firms that refinance. | Fixed\u2011rate borrowers (who do not benefit from lower rates) and savers who earn less interest on deposits. |\n| **1b. \u201cLiquidity\u201d for banks** (bank\u2011reserve channel) | Central bank purchases increase banks\u2019 reserves; in theory this should free up capacity to lend. | Companies that obtain new loans, especially those with good credit ratings; households that get mortgages or credit\u2011cards. | Credit\u2011constrained borrowers (low\u2011income households, small firms with weak balance sheets) if banks choose to hold excess reserves rather than lend. |\n| **2. Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Central bank buys safe assets \u2192 investors sell those assets and buy riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, REITs). | Households that own equities, corporate bonds, or real\u2011estate directly or via retirement accounts; high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals whose wealth is asset\u2011heavy. | Households that hold most of their wealth in cash or low\u2011yielding safe assets (e.g., low\u2011income renters, retirees on fixed incomes). |\n| **3. \u201cWealth effect\u201d on consumption** | Higher asset prices increase perceived wealth \u2192 higher marginal propensity to consume (MPC) for those who hold the assets. | Same groups as (2); also indirect spill\u2011overs to employees of firms whose stock price rises (via higher wages or bonuses). | Those whose wealth does not rise (or falls) \u2192 consumption may not increase; may even fall if they feel \u201ccrowded out\u201d by inflation expectations. |\n| **4. Exchange\u2011rate / export channel** | QE often depresses the domestic currency, making exports cheaper. | Export\u2011oriented firms and workers in those sectors; regions with manufacturing clusters. | Import\u2011competing workers (especially in regions with \u201cdead\u2011weight\u201d industries) and consumers who face higher import prices if the currency does not depreciate enough. |\n| **5. Inflation expectations** | QE can raise expected inflation, which may erode the real value of fixed\u2011income assets. | Debtors (including mortgage borrowers with variable rates) if inflation outpaces wage growth. | Holders of cash, bonds, or pensions indexed to nominal returns; low\u2011income retirees whose consumption is tied to fixed nominal incomes. |\n| **6. Fiscal\u2011QE interaction** | Central banks sometimes purchase government debt, effectively financing fiscal stimulus. | Recipients of the fiscal spending (e.g., infrastructure projects, unemployment benefits). | Taxpayers in the long run if debt sustainability becomes a concern; future generations if inflation or higher taxes are needed to service debt. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the Empirical Literature Finds\n\n### 2.1.
