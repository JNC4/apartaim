      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nIn most empirical studies, signing a free\u2011trade agreement (FTA) tends to raise overall employment and average wages in the *long run* by expanding markets, lowering the cost of imported inputs, and encouraging investment.  However, the *distribution* of those gains is uneven: workers in industries that lose competition from imports can face job loss or wage pressure, while workers in export\u2011oriented or productivity\u2011intensive sectors tend to see better prospects.  The net effect for any particular worker therefore depends on:\n\n| Factor | How it shapes the outcome |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Industry exposure** | Jobs in sectors that face import competition (e.g., low\u2011skill manufacturing) are most at risk; jobs in sectors that gain export markets (e.g., high\u2011skill services, capital\u2011intensive manufacturing) tend to expand. |\n| **Skill level** | High\u2011skill, college\u2011educated workers usually benefit from higher wages and more jobs; low\u2011skill workers may experience stagnant or modestly lower wages unless compensating policies are in place. |\n| **Labor\u2011market institutions** | Strong unemployment insurance, active labour\u2011market programmes, and collective bargaining can smooth the transition and protect wages. |\n| **Country\u2019s development stage** | Developed\u2011economy workers often see modest wage gains; workers in developing economies can see larger wage growth but also larger displacement risk. |\n| **Speed of adjustment** | Economies with flexible labour markets and good vocational\u2011training systems adjust more quickly, limiting periods of unemployment. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that explains why these patterns appear, where the evidence is strongest, and where uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical expectations\n\n1. **Trade creation vs. trade diversion** \u2013 An FTA removes tariffs between signatories, making it cheaper to import from each other and to export to each other.  The classic \u201ccomparative\u2011advantage\u201d model predicts:\n   * **Export\u2011expanding sectors** gain market size \u2192 higher output \u2192 more labour demand \u2192 higher wages.\n   * **Import\u2011competing sectors** face tougher competition \u2192 output falls \u2192 workers may be displaced or forced to accept lower wages.\n\n2. **Factor\u2011price equalisation** \u2013 In the long run, increased factor mobility (capital, labour) tends to equalise the price of those factors across countries.  For workers, this predicts:\n   * **Skill\u2011biased gains** when the partner country is more \u201cskill\u2011intensive\u201d (high\u2011skill wages rise, low\u2011skill wages may fall).\n   * **Convergence** when a lower\u2011wage country gains access to higher\u2011productivity technology, potentially lifting its wage level.\n\n3. **Dynamic effects** \u2013 FTAs can spur:\n   * **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** \u2192 new factories, R&D centres \u2192 new jobs.\n   * **Technology diffusion** \u2192 productivity gains \u2192 higher real wages over time.\n   * **Economies of scale** \u2192 lower unit costs \u2192 higher competitiveness \u2192 more hiring.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**  \nIn the scholarly and policy literature, free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are found to **raise average national income and, on balance, raise average wages**, but the gains are **unevenly distributed**.  Jobs tend to shift **away from sectors that are protected by tariffs** and toward **export\u2011oriented or import\u2011competing sectors that can use imported inputs more cheaply**.  The net effect on any individual worker depends on (1) the worker\u2019s skill level, (2) the industry in which they are employed, (3) the strength of domestic adjustment institutions (e.g., unemployment insurance, active\u2011labour\u2011market programmes), and (4) the broader macro\u2011economic context (e.g., overall growth, exchange\u2011rate movements).\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, evidence\u2011based overview** that lays out what is well\u2011established, what remains debated, and what is often overlooked.
