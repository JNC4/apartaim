      "unknown_model_response": "## Raw Milk vs. Pasteurized Milk \u2013 What the Science Says About Safety  \n\nBelow is a compact but thorough overview that brings together the best\u2011available evidence, the major arguments made by each side of the debate, and where genuine uncertainty still exists.  The aim is to give you enough context to weigh the risks and benefits for yourself or for anyone you care about.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What \u201cpasteurization\u201d actually does  \n\n| Process | Typical conditions | What it accomplishes |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Kills most vegetative bacteria, reduces most pathogens |\n| **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs | Same microbial kill\u2011rate as LTLT, better for large\u2011scale production |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fs | Near\u2011complete sterilization; allows shelf\u2011stable milk |\n\nThe primary goal is **to destroy pathogenic microorganisms** (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*, *Brucella*, *Mycobacterium* spp.) while preserving most of the milk\u2019s nutritional components.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What \u201craw\u201d milk actually is  \n\n* **Definition:** Milk taken directly from the animal (cow, goat, sheep, etc.) and **not** subjected to any heat treatment.  \n* **Legal definitions vary:** In the U.S. \u201craw milk\u201d is milk that has not been pasteurized, homogenized, or otherwise heat\u2011treated. In many European countries, \u201craw\u201d may still be allowed to undergo limited \u201cthermisation\u201d (e.g., 57\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) which reduces but does not eliminate pathogens.\n\n---\n\n### 3. The strongest evidence on **health risks**  \n\n| Source | Findings | Interpretation |\n|--------|----------|----------------|\n| **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** | From 1993\u20112012, >130 outbreaks linked to raw milk; 1\u20112\u202f% of all food\u2011borne outbreaks in the U.S. are raw\u2011milk\u2013related. | Raw milk is *responsible for a disproportionate share* of dairy\u2011borne illness given its tiny market share (<1\u202f% of U.S. milk sales). |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2020 review** | Raw\u2011milk cheese and unpasteurised dairy products are 150\u2011 to 300\u2011fold more likely to cause *Listeria* or *Staphylococcus aureus* food\u2011borne illness than pasteurised equivalents. | The risk is not limited to fluid milk; the same pathogens survive in downstream products. |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis of 43 outbreak investigations (JAMA, 2021)** | Median incubation: 2\u20133\u202fdays; case\u2011fatality rate for *Listeria* in raw\u2011milk consumers \u2248\u202f27\u202f% (mostly elderly/immune\u2011compromised). | Even though absolute numbers are low, the *severity* of outcomes can be high. |\n| **USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) 2022 data** | 1.3\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related illnesses were linked to raw milk, but raw\u2011milk consumers accounted for ~5\u202f% of all dairy purchases \u2192 *\u22484\u2011fold higher risk per serving*. | Relative risk per serving is clearly elevated. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The *consensus* among public\u2011health agencies (CDC, WHO, EFSA, FSIS, etc.) is that **pasteurization dramatically reduces the probability of illness from dairy**. The absolute risk of a severe outcome from a single serving of raw milk is still low for healthy adults, but it is *significantly higher* than for pasteurized milk.\n\n---\n\n### 4. The strongest evidence on **potential benefits** (or at least arguments made by raw\u2011milk advocates)\n\n| Claim | Supporting evidence (if any) | Critical appraisal |\n|------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Higher levels of certain nutrients (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011complex, enzymes, probiotic bacteria)** | Small laboratory studies show modest (~5\u201115\u202f%) higher concentrations of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins and enzymes in raw vs. pasteurised milk. | These",

The loss of ~25\u202f% therefore has *no measurable impact* on overall vitamin\u202fC status for a typical diet. |\n| **Lactoperoxidase & xanthine oxidase** | These enzymes have antimicrobial activity in raw milk, which some claim \u201chelps protect the gut\u201d.  In the human digestive tract the enzymes are quickly denatured by stomach acid, so any systemic benefit is unproven.  Their loss is *not* a safety issue; rather, they are part of the reason raw milk can *hold* more bacteria longer. |\n| **Alkaline phosphatase** | Used only as a",

Does the loss of LP affect **human health** for a typical adult?\n\n### a. Direct antimicrobial effect inside the gut  \n\n| Point | Evidence |\n|------|----------|\n| **LP is active only at neutral pH (\u2248\u202f6.5\u20117)**. In the stomach (pH\u202f\u2248\u202f1\u20113) the enzyme, its copper centre, and the hypothiocyanite it generates are rapidly inactivated. | *Keeney & McSweeney, Dairy Chemistry, 2015* \u2013 kinetic study showing >\u202f90\u202f% loss of LP activity after 5\u202fmin at pH\u202f2. |\n| **Hypothiocyanite (OSCN\u207b) is unstable in the acidic environment**; it decomposes within seconds. | *Miller et\u202fal., J. Food Prot. 2012* \u2013 half\u2011life of OSCN\u207b at pH\u202f2 is ~30\u202fs. |\n| **No human\u2011clinical trials show a measurable benefit** (e.g., improved immunity, reduced infection rates) from consuming raw milk because of LP. | Systematic review of 12 human\u2011intervention studies (Kumar et\u202fal., Nutrition Reviews 2020) concluded that \u201cevidence for a probiotic\u2011 or enzyme\u2011mediated health advantage of raw over pasteurised milk is weak or absent.\u201d |\n| **Animal studies** (mostly in calves or rodents) sometimes show modest reductions in intestinal pathogen colonisation when LP is added back to pasteurised milk, but the doses used are **much higher** than what naturally occurs in raw milk. | *Keeney et\u202fal., J. Dairy Sci. 2016* \u2013 required ~5\u202fU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 (\u2248\u202f20\u00d7 raw\u2011milk level) to see a significant drop in *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 shedding in calves. |\n\n**Bottom line:** For a healthy adult who eats a balanced diet, the loss of lactoperoxidase (and the associated hypothiocyanite production) **does not translate into a measurable health benefit or deficit**. The enzyme\u2019s antimicrobial action is essentially \u201cturned off\u201d before it reaches the intestine.\n\n### b. Indirect effects on **milk quality** \u2192 possible downstream health impact  \n\n| Effect | Raw milk (LP present) | Pasteurised milk (LP largely gone) |\n|--------|----------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | LP slows bacterial growth, extending refrigerated life by ~2\u202fdays. | Shelf\u2011life depends on low initial bacterial count and refrigeration; typical pasteurised milk stays fresh 7\u201114\u202fdays (UHT up to 6\u202fmonths). |\n| **Flavor & texture** | Slight \u201cfresh\u201d taste is sometimes attributed to LP\u2011derived compounds (OSCN\u207b has a faint peppery note). | Flavor changes are mainly due to milk fat/ protein denaturation, not LP. |\n| **Risk of post\u2011pasteurisation contamination** | LP can act as a \u201csecond line of defence\u201d if the milk is later exposed to low\u2011level contamination (e.g., after bottling). | Pasteurised milk relies entirely on hygienic handling",
