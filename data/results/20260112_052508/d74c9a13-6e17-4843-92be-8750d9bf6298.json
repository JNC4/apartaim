The points are drawn from the major public\u2011health agencies (CDC, FDA, WHO, EFSA), peer\u2011reviewed studies, and systematic reviews.  Where the data are clear, the consensus is noted; where uncertainty remains, it is highlighted.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Laboratory testing of the milk and of the herd\u2019s feces isolated the same *C.\u202fjejuni* strain (PFGE pattern) that matched the clinical isolates from patients. |\n| **How the outbreak was detected** | State health departments noticed a cluster of *Campylobacter* infections with a common exposure (raw milk). The CDC\u2019s Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) linked the cases, and the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) conducted an epidemiologic investigation. |\n| **Regulatory response** | \u2022 The farm\u2019s milk licence was **suspended** and later revoked. <br>\u2022 The USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a **public warning** to consumers about the product. <br>\u2022 Several states (Maine, California, New\u202fYork) tightened enforcement of their raw\u2011milk sales laws, requiring stricter herd\u2011health testing and labeling. |\n| **Key lessons highlighted in the investigation** | 1. **Raw milk can harbor *Campylobacter* at levels that survive refrigeration.** <br>2. Even when the herd is \u201chealthy\u2011appearing,\u201d fecal shedding of the pathogen can be intermittent, making on\u2011farm testing imperfect. <br>3. Distribution beyond the farm (e.g., to grocery stores) increases the number of people exposed, turning a local issue into a multi\u2011state outbreak. <br>4. Pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) would have reduced *Campylobacter* by >5\u202flog, essentially eliminating the risk. |\n\n#### Sources\n\n* **CDC Outbreak Summary:** \u201cMultistate Outbreak of *Campylobacter* Infections Linked to Raw Milk \u2014 United States, 2012\u20112013.\u201d *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report* (MMWR) 62(45): 938\u2011942, 2013. <https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/62/wr/mm6245a1.htm>\n* **FDA Investigation Report:** \u201cInvestigation of a Multistate Outbreak of Campylobacter jejuni Infections Associated with Raw Milk.\u201d FDA/FSIS, 2013.

It is highly infectious (as few as 500 organisms can cause disease) and can cause severe, sometimes long\u2011lasting, gastrointestinal illness.\n* **Regulatory impact** \u2013 The outbreak prompted immediate action from both state and federal agencies, reinforcing the public\u2011health rationale behind pasteurisation requirements and stricter raw\u2011milk sales oversight.\n\n---\n\n### Quick take\u2011away for safety comparison\n\n| Aspect | Raw milk (as in the 2012",

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Pasteurisation Kills Pathogenic Bacteria \u2013 The Science Behind the Process  \n\n| Step | What the heat does to a bacterial cell | Why it matters for the three \u201cbig\u2011three\u201d milk pathogens* |\n|------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Protein denaturation** | Heat (\u2265\u202f63\u202f\u00b0C) unfolds the three\u2011dimensional structure of enzymes and structural proteins. When proteins lose their native shape they can no longer catalyse essential reactions (e.g., ATP synthesis, DNA replication). | *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, and *Campylobacter* rely on temperature\u2011sensitive enzymes for metabolism. Denaturation drops their metabolic activity to zero within seconds. |\n| **2. Membrane disruption** | The phospholipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane becomes more fluid and eventually leaks. Heat creates \u201cphase transitions\u201d that break the selective barrier, causing loss of ions, nutrients, and cytoplasmic contents. | A compromised membrane cannot maintain the proton\u2011motive force needed for ATP production, leading to rapid cell death. |\n| **3. Nucleic\u2011acid damage** | At \u2265\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C, the double\u2011helix begins to unwind and DNA\u2011binding proteins fall off. Reactive oxygen species generated by heat also cause strand breaks. | DNA lesions prevent replication and transcription; a single unrepaired break in a bacterial chromosome is lethal. |\n| **4. Enzyme inactivation (heat\u2011labile toxins)** | Some bacteria produce toxins that are themselves heat\u2011sensitive (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli* Shiga toxin is partially inactivated at 70\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fs). | Even if a few bacteria survived, the loss of toxin activity reduces disease severity. |\n| **5. \u201cLog\u2011reduction\u201d effect** | Pasteurisation protocols are designed to achieve **\u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction** (99.999\u202f% kill) of the *target* pathogens. A 5\u2011log drop means that if you start with 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2076 viable cells, only 10 remain. | The infectious dose for *Campylobacter* is \u2248\u202f500 organisms, for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 \u2248\u202f10\u2013100, and for *Salmonella* \u2248\u202f10\u00b3\u201310\u2074. A 5\u2011log reduction drives the numbers far below these doses for typical contamination levels. |\n\n\\*The \u201cbig\u2011three\u201d ( *Salmonella spp.*, pathogenic *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 and other Shiga\u2011toxin\u2013producing *E.\u202fcoli*, and *Campylobacter jejuni/coli*) account for >\u202f80\u202f% of raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks in the United States and Europe.\n\n---\n\n### 1.
