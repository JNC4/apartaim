      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are a coercive tool that states (or multilateral organisations) use to try to change the behaviour of another government.**  \nThey work by altering the target country\u2019s cost\u2011benefit calculations: the cost side is created by restricting trade, finance, investment or travel; the benefit side is the hoped\u2011for policy change that would lift the restrictions. Whether the \u201ccosts\u201d outweigh the \u201cbenefits\u201d for the targeted regime depends on a bundle of political, economic and strategic factors, which is why the outcomes of sanctions are so varied.\n\nBelow is a structured overview that pulls together the most widely cited evidence, the main mechanisms that drive those outcomes, and the points on which scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The basic causal chain\n\n| Step | What happens | Typical evidence |\n|------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **(a) Imposition** | A sanction\u2011issuing actor (UN, EU, US, etc.) enacts a restriction: <br>\u2022 Trade bans (e.g., oil embargoes) <br>\u2022 Financial blocks (SWIFT exclusion, asset freezes) <br>\u2022 Investment prohibitions <br>\u2022 Travel bans on officials | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f(2007) catalogue >\u202f4,000 sanctions episodes and classify them by type. |\n| **(b) Economic shock** | The target\u2019s export revenues, access to foreign capital, or supply of critical inputs fall. The shock can be **direct** (lost export sales) or **indirect** (higher borrowing costs, reduced foreign\u2011direct investment). | Empirical work on Iran\u2019s oil sanctions (Kelley\u202f2015) shows a 30\u201140\u202f% drop in oil export earnings; IMF \u201cWorld Economic Outlook\u201d estimates for Russia after 2014 sanctions show a 2\u20113\u202f% GDP hit. |\n| **(c) Political pressure** | The regime must decide whether to absorb the costs, re\u2011allocate resources, or change policy to lift the sanctions. The decision is mediated by: <br>\u2022 **Regime type** (authoritarian vs. democratic) <br>\u2022 **Elite cohesion** (how many elites are directly affected) <br>\u2022 **Public opinion & elite dissent** <br>\u2022 **Availability of alternatives** (e.g., pivot to China, illicit networks) | Drezner\u202f(2011) finds democracies are slightly more responsive because public opinion can punish leaders; however, authoritarian regimes can survive if elites are insulated (e.g., North Korea). |\n| **(d) Outcome** | \u2013 **Policy change / compliance** (partial or full) <br>\u2013 **Negotiated settlement** (e.g., Iran nuclear deal) <br>\u2013 **Regime resilience** (policy unchanged) <br>\u2013 **Unintended consequences** (humanitarian hardship, \u201crally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag\u201d effect) | Peksen\u202f(2019) meta\u2011analysis: only ~30\u202f% of sanctions achieve their stated political objectives; ~70\u202f% produce limited or ambiguous outcomes. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the empirical literature tells us\n\n| Finding | Representative studies | Core takeaway |\n|---------|------------------------|---------------|\n| **Sanctions are more likely to work when they are multilateral and tightly enforced.** | Hufbauer et\u202fal.\u202f2007; Kaempfer & Lowenberg\u202f2016 (UN\u2011security\u2011council sanctions) | Coordination reduces \u201cleakage\u201d (target can shift trade to a non\u2011sanctioning partner). |\n| **Financial sanctions (asset freezes, SWIFT bans) have a higher success rate than trade bans alone.** | Drezner\u202f2011; Early\u202f2020 (U.S. secondary sanctions on Iran) | Cutting off the ability to move money directly threatens elite wealth and government financing. |\n| **Target country\u2019s economic openness matters.** | Peksen\u202f2019; Pape\u202f1997 (classic \u201csanctions paradox\u201d) | Open economies that depend on external markets feel the pain more acutely; closed economies can insulate themselves (e.g., Cuba pre\u20111990s). |\n| **Regime type matters, but not",

The **1994 democratic elections** and the adoption of a new constitution formally ended apartheid. |\n| **Economic impact** | \u2022 **Export collapse:** South African gold exports fell from ~350\u202f000\u202ft (1984) to ~200\u202f000\u202ft (1991); diamond exports lost ~30\u202f% of value. <br>\u2022 **Capital flight:** Foreign direct investment (FDI) fell from US$\u202f5\u202fbn/yr (early\u201180s) to <US$\u202f1\u202fbn/yr (late\u201180s). <br>\u2022 **Currency pressure:** The rand depreciated >\u202f50\u202f% against the dollar between 1985 and 1991, inflating import costs. | \u2022 **No viable alternative market:** The arms embargo was especially potent because the major arms producers (US, UK, France, Germany, USSR) were all UN members; South Africa could not purchase modern weaponry without violating UN rules. <br>\u2022 **Financial isolation:** International banks, following UN guidance, refused to process South\u2011African sovereign or corporate transactions, raising the cost of borrowing to double\u2011digit spreads. | \u2022 **Domestic political calculus:** The ruling National Party elite, whose personal wealth was increasingly tied to the global financial system, calculated that incremental reforms (limited liberalisation, 1990\u20131992 \u201creforms\u201d) would be cheaper than continued isolation. <br>\u2022 **Elite defections:** High\u2011profile businessmen and military officers publicly called for negotiations once sanctions made the cost of maintaining the status quo untenable. |\n| **Key scholarly assessments** | \u2022 **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007)** list this as the **\u201cmost successful\u201d** UN sanctions episode in their database of >\u202f4\u202f000 cases. <br>\u2022 **Mack (1998)** argues that the *collective* nature of the sanctions amplified their *credibility* and *durability*, preventing the regime from exploiting \u201csanctions\u2011shopping.\u201d <br>\u2022 **Mohan & Vashist (2015)** estimate that the sanctions contributed **\u2248\u202f2\u20133\u202f% of South Africa\u2019s annual GDP loss**\u2014enough to tip the cost\u2011benefit balance toward negotiation. | \u2022 **Outcome:** The sanctions helped create a *strategic* environment in which the apartheid government perceived that **only a negotiated transition could restore economic normalcy**. The 1994 democratic elections and the dismantling of apartheid laws are widely cited as the **direct political payoff** of the multilateral sanctions regime. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Reducing its **enriched\u2011uranium stockpile** from ~10\u202f000\u202fkg to 370\u202fkg. <br>2. Limiting uranium enrichment to **3.67\u202f%** (commercial power\u2011reactor level). <br>3. Cutting the number of **centrifuges** in operation from ~19\u202f000 to **5\u202f000**. <br>4. Allowing **extensive IAEA inspections** of its nuclear facilities for 15\u201125\u202fyears. <br>5. Accepting a **phased lifting** of UN, EU, and U.S. sanctions in exchange for compliance. |\n| **Economic shock** | \u2022 **Oil\u2011export revenue** fell from **\u2248\u202fUS$\u202f70\u202fbn/yr (2005)** to **\u2248\u202fUS$\u202f15\u202fbn/yr (2012)** \u2013 a **~80\u202f% drop**. <br>\u2022 **Currency collapse:** The rial depreciated from **\u2248\u202f8\u202f000\u202fIRR/USD (2005)** to **\u2248\u202f33\u202f000\u202fIRR/USD (2012)**, sparking inflation that peaked at **\u2248\u202f40\u202f%** in 2012. <br>\u2022 **FDI & banking:** Foreign investment stalled; Iranian banks were cut off from the global payment system, forcing the government to rely on **informal \u201chawala\u201d channels**. <br>\u2022 **Government budget squeeze:** Oil\u2011related revenues, which funded ~\u202f50\u202f% of the state budget, fell dramatically, forcing cuts in public spending and increasing the fiscal deficit. | \u2022 **Broad,",
