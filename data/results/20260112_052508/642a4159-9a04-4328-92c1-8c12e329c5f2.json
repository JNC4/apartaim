Passive (spontaneous\u2011report) systems\n\n| System | Who can report? | What it captures | Strengths | Limitations |\n|--------|----------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| **VAERS (U.S.)** | Health\u2011care providers, manufacturers, patients, parents | Any adverse event that occurs after vaccination, regardless of causality | Very broad, real\u2011time, easy to use; useful for early \u201csignal generation.\u201d | Under\u2011reporting (many events never get reported); over\u2011reporting (events unrelated to the vaccine are included); no denominator (cannot calculate incidence directly). |\n| **Yellow Card (UK)** | Same as VAERS, plus a dedicated website and 24\u2011h hotline | Similar breadth; also collects batch numbers for lot\u2011tracking. | Good linkage to NHS electronic records for follow\u2011up. | Same under/over\u2011reporting issues. |\n| **EudraVigilance (EU)** | Professionals & patients across EU/EEA | Centralised European database; integrates with WHO\u2011VigiBase. | Facilitates cross\u2011country signal detection. | Variable reporting rates between countries. |\n| **VigiBase (WHO)** | Over 130 national centres worldwide | Global pool of >30\u202fmillion reports. | Allows detection of signals that are too rare in any single country. | Heterogeneity in data quality, coding, and completeness. |\n\n**How signals are spotted in passive data**\n\n1. **Disproportionality analysis** \u2013 statistical \u201cratio\u201d tests (e.g., Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio, Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean). If a specific event is reported **more often** with a vaccine than would be expected based on all other vaccine\u2011event pairs, it raises a flag.  \n2. **Temporal clustering** \u2013 looking for spikes in reports shortly after a new vaccine rollout.  \n3. **Lot\u2011specific clustering** \u2013 if many reports involve the same batch number, it may point to a manufacturing issue.\n\n*Example*: In 1999, an unexpected surge of **intussusception** reports after the first licensed rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield) was detected through VAERS. The signal prompted a rapid epidemiologic investigation, confirming a causal link (\u22481 case per\u202f10\u202f000 doses). The vaccine was voluntarily withdrawn, and newer rotavirus vaccines were reformulated with a much lower risk (<1 case per\u202f100\u202f000 doses).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Active (sentinel\u2011cohort) surveillance\n\nPassive systems are essential for hypothesis generation, but they cannot **measure incidence** or **prove causality**.
