The USPHS/CDC \u201coptimal\u201d level is the concentration that public\u2011health officials aim for when they deliberately add fluoride (community water fluoridation).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the numbers are derived\n\n### 2.1. Dental\u2011caries evidence\n* **Epidemiology:** Large, decades\u2011long U.S. and international studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the \u201cCommunity Dental Health Project\u201d) show that communities with water fluoride \u22480.7\u202fmg/L have **15\u201325\u202f% fewer caries** in children and adults compared with non\u2011fluoridated communities.\n* **Mechanism:** Fluoride ions incorporated into developing enamel crystals (hydroxy\u2011apatite \u2192 fluorapatite) make the enamel **more resistant to acid dissolution**. In older teeth, low\u2011level fluoride in saliva provides a **topical, remineralizing effect**.\n\n### 2.2. Toxicology & safety margins\n* **Acute toxicity:** The oral LD\u2085\u2080 (dose that kills 50\u202f% of test animals) for fluoride is >5\u202fg/kg\u2014far above any realistic human exposure from drinking water.\n* **Chronic toxicity:** The **U.S. EPA\u2019s Reference Dose (RfD)** for fluoride is **0.04\u202fmg/kg\u2011day** (based on the no\u2011observable\u2011effect level for skeletal fluorosis in dogs, with a 10\u2011fold safety factor). For a 70\u2011kg adult, that equals 2.8\u202fmg/day.\n* **Daily intake at 0.7\u202fmg/L:** A person drinking 2\u202fL of water gets **\u22481.4\u202fmg fluoride/day**, well below the RfD, leaving a large margin of safety even when fluoride from food, tea, and dental products is added.\n\n### 2.3. Upper health\u2011based limits\n* **Skeletal fluorosis** (painful joint stiffness, bone changes) has been documented in populations exposed to **>4\u202fmg/L** for many years, often in areas with naturally high fluoride.\n* **Dental fluorosis** (mottling of tooth enamel) appears when **intake exceeds about 2\u202fmg/L** during tooth development.",
