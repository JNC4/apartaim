For unprocessed red meat, the increase is smaller (\u2248\u202f5\u201110\u202f% per 100\u202fg/day) but still statistically significant in many analyses. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses (e.g., Aune et\u202fal., 2013; Larsson & Wolk, 2020)** | Pooled data from dozens of studies | Consistently find a modest but measurable rise in colorectal cancer risk with higher red meat intake.
