      "unknown_model_response": "**How scientists decide if a genetically\u2011modified (GM) food is safe for people**\n\nThe safety assessment of a GM food is a step\u2011by\u2011step, evidence\u2011based process that is carried out before the product can be marketed.  The same basic framework is used in the United States, the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia, Brazil and many other countries, and it is endorsed by international bodies such as the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, and the **Codex Alimentarius Commission**.  Below is the typical workflow, together with the kinds of data that are generated at each stage and what they are meant to show.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Molecular and Genetic Characterisation  \n\n| What is done | Why it matters |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| **Insert description** \u2013 exact DNA sequence of the transgene(s), the promoter, terminator, and any selectable marker. | Allows comparison with known genes and proteins; forms the basis for all downstream tests. |\n| **Copy\u2011number and insertion site analysis** (e.g., Southern blot, qPCR, whole\u2011genome sequencing). | Shows how many copies are present and whether the insertion disrupted any native gene that could affect metabolism or allergenicity. |\n| **Stability testing** (segregation over several generations). | Confirms that the inserted trait does not change unexpectedly during breeding. |\n\n*Key reference*: OECD Consensus Document on the Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Plants (2009).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Comparative (Substantial\u2011Equivalence) Assessment  \n\nThe GM plant is grown side\u2011by\u2011side with a **non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic comparator** under the same agronomic conditions. Scientists then compare:\n\n1. **Composition** \u2013 levels of macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, antinutrients, and known natural toxins (e.g., glycoalkaloids in potatoes).  \n2. **Agronomic traits** \u2013 yield, phenology, pest pressure, etc.  \n\nStatistical analysis looks for **significant differences** that fall outside the range of natural variation observed in conventional varieties.  \n\n*If a difference is found*, a targeted safety evaluation (e.g., toxicology) is performed for that component.\n\n*Key consensus*: The concept of substantial equivalence is endorsed by WHO/FAO (2004) and EFSA (2012). It is a **starting point**, not a final verdict.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Allergenicity Assessment  \n\n1. **In\u2011silico protein similarity** \u2013 compare the new protein(s) to known food allergens using databases such as AllergenOnline.  \n2. **Pepsin resistance test** \u2013 evaluates whether the protein is rapidly degraded in simulated gastric fluid (most allergens are stable).  \n3. **Serum IgE binding** \u2013 if a close match to a known allergen is found, sera from allergic individuals may be tested.  \n4. **Source organism history** \u2013 if the gene comes from a plant or microbe that is already part of the human diet and not allergenic, the risk is considered low.\n\n*Outcome*: The protein must not be substantially similar to a known allergen, and it must not exhibit properties typical of allergens.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Toxicology Assessment  \n\n### a. Acute and Sub\u2011chronic Animal Feeding Studies  \n* Commonly 90\u2011day rodent studies (e.g., OECD TG 408) where the GM food replaces a portion of the diet at several dosage levels (often 100\u202f% of the diet).  \n* Endpoints: body\u2011weight gain, clinical chemistry, organ weights, histopathology, and any adverse clinical signs.  \n\n### b. Specific Toxicity Tests (if needed)  \n* **In vitro genotoxicity** (Ames test, mouse lymphoma assay) for the newly expressed protein.  \n* **N\u2011acetyl",
