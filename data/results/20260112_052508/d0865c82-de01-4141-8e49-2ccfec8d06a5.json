      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 was the result of a complex web of political, economic, social, and cultural forces that had been building for decades.  Historians agree that **the institution of slavery\u2014and the disputes over its expansion and ultimate fate\u2014was the central, underlying cause**, but they also point to a set of inter\u2011related factors that made war increasingly likely: sectional economic divergence, competing visions of federal versus state authority, a series of political crises over the status of new territories, the rise of an abolitionist public sphere, and the failure of compromise mechanisms within the nation\u2019s political system.\n\nBelow is a structured overview that presents the major factors, the evidence that supports each, and the scholarly debates that surround them.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Slavery as the Core Issue  \n\n| Aspect | Evidence & Key Events | Why it mattered |\n|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| **Moral and political conflict over slavery** | \u2022 1830s\u20131850s abolitionist literature (e.g., William Lloyd\u202fGarrison\u2019s *The Liberator*, Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s *Uncle\u202fTom\u2019s Cabin*).<br>\u2022 1850\u20111851 \u201cFree\u2011State\u201d vs. \u201cSlave\u2011State\u201d conventions in the North and South.<br>\u2022 1854 Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act and \u201cBleeding Kansas\u201d (violent clashes over whether the territory would be free or slave). | The growing moral opposition in the North and the determination of Southern elites to protect a labor system they saw as essential to their economy and social order created an irreconcilable ideological divide. |\n| **Economic dependence on slave labor** | \u2022 Census data (1860): 3.9\u202fmillion enslaved people\u2014\u2248\u202f12\u202f% of the total U.S. population, 1/4 of the Southern labor force.<br>\u2022 1850\u20111860 cotton production: 4.5\u202fbillion pounds, 60\u202f% of world supply; 80\u202f% of Southern export value. | The Southern planter class argued that any restriction on slavery threatened the region\u2019s wealth, political power, and way of life. |\n| **Legal and constitutional battles** | \u2022 1803 *Marbury v. Madison* (judicial review) set the stage for later court disputes.<br>\u2022 1857 *Dred Scott v. Sandford*: Supreme Court ruled that African Americans could not be citizens and that Congress lacked power to prohibit slavery in territories. | The decision intensified Northern outrage, validated Southern claims of \u201cproperty rights,\u201d and demonstrated that the existing constitutional framework could not settle the dispute. |\n| **Political parties split over slavery** | \u2022 1854 formation of the Republican Party on a platform opposing the expansion of slavery.<br>\u2022 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, without any Southern electoral votes. | The emergence of a national party explicitly hostile to slavery\u2019s spread convinced many Southerners that they could no longer protect their interests within the Union. |\n\n**Scholarly consensus:** Most modern historians (e.g., James McPherson, Eric Foner, David Blight) place slavery at the heart of the conflict. The \u201cLost Cause\u201d narrative that emphasizes \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d without mentioning slavery is now regarded as a post\u2011war revisionist myth.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Economic and Social Divergence Between North and South  \n\n| Factor | Evidence | How it fed the crisis |\n|--------|----------|-----------------------|\n| **Industrial vs. agricultural economies** | \u2022 1860 Census: North held 90\u202f% of all manufacturing establishments and 76\u202f% of railroad mileage.<br>\u2022 Southern economy: 77\u202f% of value added came from agriculture, especially cotton. | Different economic interests produced conflicting tariff preferences (North favored protective tariffs; South favored free trade) and divergent visions of national development. |\n| **Tariff debates** | \u2022 Tariff of 1828 (\u201cTariff of Abominations\u201d) sparked a nullification crisis in South Carolina (1832).<br>\u2022 1857 *Dred Scott* decision coincided with the Panic of 1857, which hit the agrarian South harder. | The South viewed high tariffs as an unfair transfer of wealth to Northern manufacturers, reinforcing the perception that the federal government served Northern interests. |\n| **Labor systems** | \u2022 Slave labor vs. wage labor; the North\u2019s growing immigrant workforce contrasted sharply with the South\u2019s reliance on enslaved labor. | The differing labor",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is one of the most frequently\u2011cited, concrete moments in which Southern leaders invoked **\u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d**\u202f\u2014\u202fnot as an abstract principle of limited government, but as a legal\u2011political shield for the protection of slavery.  The example combines a **primary\u2011source declaration (the South\u2011Carolina Ordinance of Secession, December\u202f20\u202f1859/1860)** with the **theoretical justification offered earlier by John\u202fC.\u202fCalhoun** and the **later \u201cCornerstone\u201d speech of Alexander\u202fH.\u202fStephens**.
