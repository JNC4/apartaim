Where the scientific community has reached a strong consensus, that is highlighted; where questions remain or where public controversy exists, those points are noted together with the current state of the evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How vaccines \u201cteach\u201d the immune system\n\n| Vaccine type | What the child receives | How it stimulates immunity | Typical examples in the U.S. schedule |\n|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Live\u2011attenuated** | A weakened form of the whole pathogen that can still replicate a little but cannot cause disease in healthy people. | Replicates enough to expose the immune system to many of the organism\u2019s proteins \u2192 robust antibody\u202f+\u202fcell\u2011mediated response; often yields long\u2011lasting immunity after one dose. | Measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR), varicella (chickenpox), rotavirus (some formulations), oral polio vaccine (used in many low\u2011income countries). |\n| **Inactivated (killed)** | Whole pathogen that has been chemically or heat\u2011inactivated. | Provides many antigens but cannot replicate, so the immune response is mainly antibody\u2011mediated and usually requires \u22652 doses (prime\u2011boost) and sometimes adjuvants. | Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), hepatitis\u202fA, rabies (post\u2011exposure). |\n| **Subunit / protein / conjugate** | Only specific proteins, polysaccharides, or fragments of the pathogen (e.g., surface proteins). | Focuses the immune system on the most protective parts; often combined with an **adjuvant** (e.g., aluminum salts) to strengthen the response. | DTaP (diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb), hepatitis\u202fB, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13). |\n| **mRNA** | Messenger\u2011RNA that encodes a viral protein (most famously the spike protein of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112). The mRNA is delivered in a lipid nanoparticle. | Host cells translate the mRNA \u2192 produce the viral protein \u2192 immune system sees it as foreign \u2192 generates both antibodies and T\u2011cell responses. The mRNA itself degrades quickly, leaving no permanent genetic material. | COVID\u201119 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer\u2011BioNTech, Moderna) \u2013 now being evaluated",

      "unknown_model_response": "## Safety Monitoring of Childhood Vaccines \u2013 How the System Works  \n\n| **Stage** | **What happens** | **Key U.S. agencies / programs** | **What the data look like** |\n|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **1. Pre\u2011licensure clinical trials** | \u2022 Phase\u202fI \u2013 small groups (tens) to look for obvious safety problems and to find the right dose.<br>\u2022 Phase\u202fII \u2013 hundreds, more detailed safety and immune\u2011response data.<br>\u2022 Phase\u202fIII \u2013 thousands (often 5\u202f000\u201330\u202f000) to detect less\u2011common adverse events and confirm efficacy. | FDA\u202fCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) reviews the full dossier before granting a **Biologics License Application (BLA)**. | The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) in trial participants is usually <1\u202fper\u202f10\u202f000 doses. The trials are designed to have enough power to detect events that occur at a rate of ~1 in 1\u202f000\u201310\u202f000. |\n| **2. Regulatory approval** | The FDA decides whether the vaccine\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks. The label includes the known side\u2011effect profile and any contraindications. | FDA, CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) \u2013 makes the schedule recommendation. | All vaccines on the U.S. schedule have been approved after meeting the same rigorous standards that apply to drugs. |\n| **3. Post\u2011licensure (after a vaccine is in use)** | \u2022 **Passive surveillance** \u2013 anyone can report an event; signals are screened for patterns.<br>\u2022 **Active surveillance** \u2013 defined populations are followed prospectively to capture events that might be missed in passive systems.<br>\u2022 **Special studies** \u2013 e.g., case\u2011control or cohort studies for rare outcomes. | **VAERS** (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) \u2013 national, run by CDC\u202f&\u202fFDA (passive).<br>**VSD** (Vaccine Safety Datalink) \u2013 >\u202f25 health\u2011care organizations, >\u202f12\u202fmillion people (active).<br>**CISA** (Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment) \u2013 physician\u2011expert network for complex cases.<br>**PRISM** (Post\u2011licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring) \u2013 uses large insurance\u2011claims databases.<br>**FDA\u2019s Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative** \u2013 links multiple data sources. | \u2022 VAERS receives >\u202f1\u202fmillion reports since 1990, but >\u202f99\u202f% are **non\u2011serious** (e.g., fever, soreness).<br>\u2022 VSD has identified a handful of very rare risks (e.g., febrile seizures after whole\u2011cell pertussis vaccine, which led to the shift to acellular pertussis).<br>\u2022 For the COVID\u201119 mRNA vaccines, VSD and other active systems confirmed a risk of **myocarditis** of \u2248\u202f4\u20135 cases per 1\u202fmillion second doses in 12\u2011 to\u201129\u2011year\u2011olds\u2014still far lower than the risk of myocarditis after SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection. |\n| **4. Global monitoring** | The WHO\u2019s **Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS)** reviews data from dozens of countries; the **Vaccine Safety Net** provides vetted information to the public. | WHO, UNICEF, national regulatory agencies (e.g., EMA, MHRA). | International data confirm that the safety profile observed in the U.S. is replicated worldwide, even in low\u2011resource settings where the disease burden is highest. |\n\n*Take\u2011away:*  A vaccine\u2019s safety is examined **before** it is ever given to a child **and** continuously after it is on the market.  The systems are designed to detect both common, mild reactions and very rare, serious events.\n\n---\n\n## Common (Expected) Side Effects \u2013 What most parents see\n\n| **Vaccine (or group)** | **Typical local reaction** | **Typical systemic reaction** | **Incidence (approx.)** |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **DTaP (diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis)** | Redness, swelling, tenderness",
