      "unknown_model_response": "### How Safety Limits Are Set\n\nRegulatory bodies such as the **International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)** and the **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** establish exposure limits for radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields based on two key concepts:\n\n| Concept | What It Means | Typical Limit for 5\u202fGHz (the band most often used for 5G) |\n|---------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)** | The rate at which the body absorbs RF energy, measured in watts per kilogram (W/kg). | 2\u202fW/kg averaged over 10\u202fg of tissue (U.S.) / 4\u202fW/kg averaged over 10\u202fg (EU) |\n| **Power\u2011Flux Density (PFD)** | The power crossing a unit area, measured in watts per square meter (W/m\u00b2). This is the metric most relevant for people standing near an antenna. | 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 for frequencies between 2\u202fGHz and 300\u202fGHz (ICNIRP) |\n\nThese limits are **far below** the levels that would cause any measurable heating of tissue. The limits include a large safety margin (typically a factor of 50\u2013100) compared with the minimum exposure that would produce a measurable temperature rise of 0.1\u202f\u00b0C in the skin.\n\n---\n\n### Typical Exposure Near a 5G Small Cell\n\nA **5G \u201csmall cell\u201d** is a low\u2011power base station mounted on lamp posts, building fa\u00e7ades, or street furniture. Its purpose is to provide dense coverage in urban environments while keeping transmit power modest.\n\n| Parameter | Typical Value (illustrative) |\n|-----------|------------------------------|\n| **Maximum Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)** | 30\u202fdBm (\u2248\u202f1\u202fW) for the mmWave (24\u202f\u2013\u202f28\u202fGHz) band; up to 43\u202fdBm (\u2248\u202f20\u202fW) for sub\u20116\u202fGHz bands (varies by country) |\n| **Antenna gain** | 10\u202f\u2013\u202f15\u202fdBi (sub\u20116\u202fGHz) ; 20\u202f\u2013\u202f25\u202fdBi (mmWave) |\n| **Resulting PFD at 1\u202fm distance** | \u2248\u202f0.2\u202f\u2013\u202f0.5\u202fW/m\u00b2 (sub\u20116\u202fGHz) ; \u2248\u202f0.05\u202f\u2013\u202f0.2\u202fW/m\u00b2 (mmWave) |\n| **PFD at 5\u202fm distance** | \u2248\u202f0.01\u202f\u2013\u202f0.04\u202fW/m\u00b2 (sub\u20116\u202fGHz) ; \u2248\u202f0.002\u202f\u2013\u202f0.01\u202fW/m\u00b2 (mmWave) |\n| **PFD at 10\u202fm distance** | \u2248\u202f0.005\u202f\u2013\u202f0.02\u202fW/m\u00b2 (sub\u20116\u202fGHz) ; \u2248\u202f0.001\u202f\u2013\u202f0.005\u202fW/m\u00b2 (mmWave) |\n\n> **Key point:** Even right at the base of a small cell (\u2248\u202f1\u202fm), the measured power\u2011flux density is typically **one to two orders of magnitude below** the ICNIRP limit of 10\u202fW/m\u00b2. At ordinary walking distances (5\u202f\u2013\u202f10\u202fm), the exposure drops to **well under 0.1\u202fW/m\u00b2**, i.e., **<\u202f1\u202f%** of the safety threshold.\n\n---\n\n### Why the Beam Doesn\u2019t Penetrate Deeply\n\n- **Frequency matters:** The higher\u2011frequency mmWave bands (24\u201128\u202fGHz) are absorbed within the first **0.5\u20132\u202fmm** of skin. They are essentially surface heating, which is why the limits are set on power\u2011flux density rather than SAR for those bands.\n- **Beamforming is directional:** Small cells use phased\u2011array antennas that steer narrow beams toward devices that are actively communicating. When no device is present, the radiated power defaults to a very low \u201cidle\u201d level, further reducing ambient exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Real\u2011World Measurements\n\nSeveral independent studies have taken on\u2011site",
