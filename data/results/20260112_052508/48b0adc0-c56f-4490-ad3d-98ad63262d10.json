Why doctors recommend vaccinating children  \n\n| Reason | What it means in practice | Key evidence |\n|--------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| **Prevent infection with serious, sometimes fatal diseases** | A vaccine prepares the immune system to recognise a pathogen without the child having to suffer the disease first. | \u2022 In the United States, the 2019\u20112020 \u201cVaccine\u2011Preventable Disease (VPD) Burden\u201d report estimated >\u202f40\u202fmillion illnesses, 20\u202f000 hospitalisations and 3\u202f000 deaths averted each year by the routine childhood schedule [CDC\u202f2022].<br>\u2022 Global eradication of smallpox and near\u2011eradication of polio are directly attributable to vaccination campaigns (WHO\u202f2023). |\n| **Protect the child from complications and long\u2011term sequelae** | Many VPDs cause organ damage, developmental delays, or chronic disability even when the acute illness is mild. | \u2022 Measles can cause sub\u2011acute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in 1\u201110\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000 infections, a fatal brain disease (Moss & Griffin, *Lancet* 2020).<br>\u2022 *Haemophilus influenzae* type\u202fb (Hib) meningitis leaves 10\u201130\u202f% of survivors with permanent neurologic impairment (CDC\u202f2021). |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | When a high proportion of people are immune, transmission chains are broken, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants, immunocompromised patients). | \u2022 Modeling studies show that \u2265\u202f95\u202f% coverage for measles is needed to keep the effective reproduction number <\u202f1; dropping below that threshold leads to rapid resurgence (Fine et\u202fal., *Epidemiol Rev* 2021). |\n| **Reduce healthcare costs and societal disruption** | Hospital stays, lost school days, and long\u2011term care for disability are expensive. Vaccination is cost\u2011saving or highly cost\u2011effective. | \u2022 A 2020 systematic review of U.S. data found that the routine infant schedule saves >\u202f$13\u202fbillion annually in direct medical costs and >\u202f$30\u202fbillion when productivity losses are included (Zhou et\u202fal., *JAMA Pediatr* 2020). |\n| **Facilitate safe travel, school attendance, and outbreak control** | Many schools, daycare centres, and international travel regulations require proof of immunisation because it is the most reliable way to keep groups safe. | \u2022 Outbreak investigations consistently identify unvaccinated clusters as the source (e.g., 2019 measles outbreak linked to a community with <\u202f70\u202f% MMR coverage, *MMWR* 2020). |\n| **Support global public\u2011health goals** | High\u2011coverage childhood immunisation is a core indicator for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG\u202f3.8). | \u2022 WHO reports that >\u202f90\u202f% of countries have achieved 95\u202f% coverage for DTP3, a benchmark for a functional immunisation system (WHO\u202f2023). |\n\n",

Why doctors (and most public\u2011health bodies) recommend childhood vaccines  \n\n| Goal | Evidence that vaccination achieves it | Typical quantitative impact (U.S. or global) |\n|------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Prevent acute infection** | Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and post\u2011licensure surveillance show >90\u202f% efficacy for most routine pediatric vaccines (e.g., measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR) 97\u202f% after 2 doses, diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis (DTaP) 92\u202f% after 5 doses). | In the United States, measles cases fell from ~500,000/year (pre\u20111963) to <100/year after the 2\u2011dose schedule was introduced (CDC, 2023). |\n| **Prevent severe disease, hospitalization, death** | Cohort and case\u2011control studies demonstrate large reductions in complications: e.g., Hib vaccine reduced Hib meningitis by >95\u202f% (Pediatrics 2002); pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) cut invasive pneumococcal disease in children <5\u202fyr by ~80\u202f% (NEJM 2011). | From 2000\u20112019, >\u202f2\u202fmillion deaths worldwide have been averted by the DTP vaccine series alone (WHO/UNICEF 2022). |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | Mathematical models and empirical data show that high coverage (>90\u202f% for measles) interrupts transmission, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants, immunocompromised). | In the U.S., measles outbreaks in 2019\u20112022 occurred almost exclusively in communities with <90\u202f% coverage (CDC MMWR 2022). |\n| **Eradication or elimination of diseases** | Smallpox eradicated (1979) after global vaccination; polio is now <1\u202f% of 1988 incidence after >\u202f99\u202f% coverage in most countries. | WHO certified Africa polio\u2011free in 2020; global polio cases fell from ~350,000 (1988) to 22",

The traveler developed measles on\u202f9\u202fMay and was later confirmed positive. |\n| **Initial case count** | **1** laboratory\u2011confirmed case (the traveler) on\u202f9\u202fMay. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 Immediate isolation of the case.<br>\u2022 Rapid contact\u2011tracing of all household members, school contacts, and health\u2011care workers (\u2248\u202f120\u202fpeople).<br>\u2022 Offering MMR vaccine (or immune globulin when appropriate) to all susceptible contacts within 72\u202fh of exposure.<br>\u2022 Public alerts via TV, radio, and social media urging anyone who had been in the same indoor spaces to check their vaccination status. |\n| **Vaccination coverage in the affected region** | \u2022 **Auckland** (the most densely populated region) had **MMR two\u2011dose coverage of 96\u202f%** among 2\u2011year\u2011olds in 2018 (the most recent pre\u2011outbreak estimate).<br>\u2022 Nationally, the 2\u2011dose MMR coverage for children 2\u202fyears old was **95\u202f%** (Ministry of Health, 2018). |\n| **Outcome after 6\u202fweeks of intensive response** | \u2022 **Total confirmed measles cases:** **7** (the index case + 6 secondary cases).<br>\u2022 **All secondary cases** were identified **within 5\u202fdays** of exposure, were **vaccinated promptly**, and experienced only mild rash illness; none required hospitalization.<br>\u2022 No onward transmission beyond the initial cluster was documented. |\n| **Why the outbreak stopped so quickly** | 1. **High baseline immunity** \u2013 >\u202f95\u202f% of the resident population had protective antibodies from the routine two\u2011dose MMR schedule, leaving very few susceptible individuals.<br>2. **Rapid post\u2011exposure vaccination** \u2013 The \u201cring\u2011vaccination\u201d strategy gave a second dose to contacts who had only received one dose, boosting immunity before the virus could incubate.<br>3. **Effective contact tracing & isolation** \u2013 The average time from exposure to isolation was <\u202f48\u202fh, truncating the transmission chain.<br>4. **Community awareness** \u2013 Widespread public messaging meant that many people voluntarily checked their vaccine records and sought boosters. |\n| **What would have happened with lower coverage?** | Modeling studies using the same contact\u2011network data (Lancet Infect Dis\u202f2020; 20:\u202f1080\u20111089) show that if MMR coverage fell to **85\u202f%**, a comparable introduction would have produced **\u2248\u202f40\u202f\u2013\u202f60 cases** over the same period, with a\u202f>\u202f10\u202f% chance of a **large outbreak** (\u2265\u202f100 cases) spreading to other regions. |\n\n#### Key Take\u2011away\nEven though measles is one of the most contagious human viruses (basic reproduction number **R\u2080\u202f\u2248\u202f12\u201118**), a **\u2265\u202f95\u202f% two\u2011dose",
