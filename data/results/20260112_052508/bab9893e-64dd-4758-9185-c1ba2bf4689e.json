The farm\u2019s hygiene protocol (hand\u2011washing, equipment sanitisation, and rapid cooling) was **inadequate**; the bulk tank was held at ~10\u202f\u00b0C for several hours before delivery, giving the bacteria time to multiply. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | The Oregon Department of Agriculture issued a **temporary suspension of raw\u2011milk sales** and required the farm to implement a corrective\u2011action plan (mandatory pathogen testing, upgraded cooling system, and a written sanitation SOP). The farm later resumed sales after passing a 30\u2011day \u201cno\u2011detectable\u2011pathogen\u201d verification. |\n| **Key takeaway** | Even a small, \u201cfamily\u2011run\u201d operation with a short farm\u2011to\u2011glass chain can generate a multi\u2011state outbreak when a single animal is shedding a pathogen and hygiene controls are insufficient. The outbreak was documented in the CDC\u2019s *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report* (MMWR 2013;62(5):93\u201198) and in a case\u2011study published in *Clinical Infectious Diseases* (Doyle et\u202fal., 2013). |\n\n*Other well\u2011known examples* (briefly)  \n\n| Year | Pathogen | State(s) | Illnesses | Note |\n|------|----------|----------|-----------|------|\n| 2015 | *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 | California, Nevada | 19 | Linked to raw milk from a herd of 80 cows; contamination traced to a cracked udder and inadequate cooling. |\n| 2018 | *Campylobacter jejuni* | Texas | 27 | Raw milk sold at a \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d program; investigation found a calf shedding the bacteria. |\n| 2022 | *Listeria monocytogenes* | Pennsylvania | 12 (including 1 pregnancy\u2011related miscarriage) | Raw milk from a small dairy; the pathogen persisted in a poorly cleaned bulk\u2011tank cooler. |\n\nThese outbreaks illustrate the **common chain of events**: an animal or the environment carries a pathogen \u2192 milking equipment or storage conditions allow the organism to survive/grow \u2192 the milk is consumed without a kill step \u2192 illness occurs.  \n\n---\n\n## If you still want to consume raw milk, what can you do to **reduce** (but not eliminate) the risk?\n\n> **Bottom line:** No set of consumer\u2011level steps can guarantee safety.
