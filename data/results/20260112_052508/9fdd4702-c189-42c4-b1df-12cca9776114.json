The basic economic mechanism\n\n1. **Comparative advantage & specialization** \u2013 An FTA removes tariffs and other trade\u2011restrictive measures, making it cheaper for firms in each country to sell to the partner market.  By the Heckscher\u2011Ohlin/\u201cnew trade theory\u201d logic, each country tends to expand production in industries where it has a relative cost advantage and contract in those where it does not.\n\n2. **Factor\u2011price effects** \u2013 When a country moves toward sectors that are more **skill\u2011intensive**, the demand for skilled labor rises relative to unskilled labor, pushing up the skill premium (the wage gap between high\u2011 and low\u2011skill workers). The opposite can happen when a country\u2019s comparative advantage lies in low\u2011skill, labor\u2011intensive manufacturing.\n\n3. **Dynamic gains** \u2013 Openness can raise total factor productivity (TFP) through technology diffusion, economies of scale, and more intense competition. Over the long run, higher productivity can raise wages across the board, but the timing and distribution of those gains are highly uneven.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) and workers \u2013 an evidence\u2011based overview**\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the strongest empirical findings, expert\u2011panel judgments, and scholarly debates about how FTAs tend to affect workers in the signatory countries.  The material is organized by the type of impact, with clear markers of where scholarly consensus exists, where the evidence is mixed, and where major uncertainties remain.  Wherever possible, I note studies that are frequently cited but also highlight research that is less visible yet important for a full picture.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Quick take\u2011away (for orientation)\n\n| Outcome | What the bulk of the evidence says | Where disagreement/uncertainty remains |\n|---------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Overall economic welfare** | FTAs raise aggregate GDP modestly (\u22480.1\u20110.5\u202f% of GDP per year) by lowering tariffs and expanding market size. | Magnitude varies by country, design of the agreement, and complementary policies. |\n| **Employment (total jobs)** | Net\u2011job effects are usually small at the national level; gains in export\u2011oriented sectors are often offset by job losses in import\u2011competing sectors. | Size of sector\u2011specific gains/losses, especially in the short\u2011run, is contested. |\n| **Wages** | In high\u2011wage, high\u2011skill economies, low\u2011skill wages tend to stagnate or fall slightly; in many developing countries, wages rise in export\u2011oriented industries. | Long\u2011run wage trajectories, the role of labor\u2011market institutions, and distribution across gender/ethnicity are debated. |\n| **Job quality & labor standards** | FTAs that contain enforceable labor\u2011rights chapters can improve workplace safety and collective\u2011bargaining coverage, but enforcement is uneven. | Effectiveness of \u201csoft\u2011law\u201d labor clauses vs. binding enforcement mechanisms is unsettled. |\n| **Inequality** | FTAs tend to increase skill\u2011biased wage differentials, raising within\u2011country inequality in most advanced economies. | The extent to which complementary redistributive policies can offset this is an open policy question. |\n| **Adjustment & mobility** | Workers displaced from shrinking sectors can re\u2011skill and move to expanding sectors, but the speed of adjustment matters. | Evidence on the adequacy of retraining programs and geographic mobility is mixed. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
