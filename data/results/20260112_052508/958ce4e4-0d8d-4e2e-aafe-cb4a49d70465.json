Base\u2011station licences are granted only if the operator can **demonstrate** that the predicted field at any publicly accessible location is **\u2264\u202fthe limit**. | This makes non\u2011compliance a rare, enforceable event; the limits are therefore *de\u2011facto* ceilings for real\u2011world exposure. |\n\n> **Bottom\u2011line:** The limits are **engineered conservatively**\u2014they are set far below the level that could cause any measurable heating, and they incorporate huge safety factors.
