The goal is to give you a \u201cmenu\u2011of\u2011effects\u201d that you can weigh against one another, not to argue for or against any particular policy.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works (theory) | Typical long\u2011term outcome (if the mechanism dominates) |\n|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Supply\u2011side constraint** | A price ceiling reduces the expected return on existing rental units and on new construction. Developers and landlords may build fewer units, convert rentals to condos or hotel rooms, or exit the market altogether. | Fewer rental units \u2192 higher market rents for the *uncontrolled* stock; the overall rental market becomes tighter, hurting affordability for new entrants. |\n| **Maintenance & quality** | With lower cash flow, landlords have less budget (and sometimes less incentive) to keep units in good repair or to invest in upgrades. | Deterioration of the controlled stock, higher \u201chousing quality gap\u201d between controlled and uncontrolled units. |\n| **Turnover & \u201chousing mismatch\u201d** | Rent caps make it cheap for tenants to stay long\u2011term, reducing vacancy turnover. | Low\u2011income households may occupy units that are \u201ctoo large\u201d for their needs, while higher\u2011income renters are squeezed out of the limited supply. |\n| **Rent\u2011price spillovers** | When a share of the market is capped, landlords of uncontrolled units may raise rents to capture excess demand (a \u201cprice\u2011raising externality\u201d). | The net effect on city\u2011wide affordability can be neutral or even negative, especially where the uncontrolled share is large. |\n| **Informal markets & \u201cshadow rents\u201d** | If legal rents are far below market willingness to pay, landlords may resort to under\u2011the\u2011table payments, key\u2011money, or selective tenant screening. | Affordability improves only on paper; low\u2011income renters still face high effective costs. |\n| **Political & regulatory feedback loops** | Rent control often creates a constituency of long\u2011term tenants who lobby for extensions, exemptions, or stricter controls. | Policies become harder to roll back even when evidence of harm accumulates, locking in the supply\u2011side effects. |\n| **Revenue effects for municipalities** | Lower rents can reduce property\u2011tax assessments (especially in jurisdictions that tax based on rental income) and cut \u201chousing\u2011related\u201d fees. | Municipal budgets may shrink, limiting funds for affordable\u2011housing programs, infrastructure, or services that indirectly affect affordability. |\n\n",

The basic definition  \n\n| Term | Plain\u2011language meaning | Typical statutory wording |\n|------|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Rent control (or \u201crent stabilization\u201d)** | A law that caps the amount a landlord can charge a **current** tenant and usually limits how fast the rent can be raised each year. | \u201cThe rent for a dwelling unit may not exceed the base rent plus the annual allowable increase.\u201d |\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol (or \u201cturnover decontrol\u201d)** | A provision that **removes the rent\u2011control ceiling** on a unit **once the tenant moves out** (i.e., when the unit becomes vacant). The landlord can then set a **new market rent** for the next tenant, and the unit stays \u201cuncontrolled\u201d for the rest of its life unless a new law re\u2011imposes control. | \u201cWhen a rent\u2011controlled unit becomes vacant, the unit shall be exempt from rent\u2011control provisions and may be rented at any rate the landlord deems appropriate.\u201d |\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol repeal (or \u201celimination\u201d)** | A policy change that **keeps the rent\u2011control ceiling in place even after a tenant leaves**, so the landlord can only raise the rent by the legally allowed amount (often a small percentage) each year, regardless of turnover. | \u201cUnits shall remain subject to rent\u2011control provisions notwithstanding a change in tenancy.\u201d |\n\nIn short, **vacancy\u2011decontrol** lets landlords \u201creset\u201d the rent to market levels every time a tenant vacates, while **no\u2011vacancy\u2011decontrol** (the version adopted in 1994 San\u202fFrancisco) forces the rent to stay under the ceiling forever.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Why vacancy\u2011decontrol matters to landlords (and to the market)\n\n| Economic incentive | How vacancy\u2011decontrol changes it |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Potential upside on turnover** | With vacancy\u2011decontrol, a landlord can capture the full market rent the moment a unit turns over, often a large jump (e.g., from $1,500 to $2,400). This creates a strong incentive to **keep turnover low** (by offering modest rent increases, better lease terms, etc.) because each vacancy is an opportunity to \u201ccash in.\u201d |\n| **Capital\u2011budgeting for new construction** | Developers calculate the *expected* long\u2011run cash flow of a building. If they know that **every unit will eventually be \u201creset\u201d to market rent**, the projected net present value (NPV) of the project is higher, making it more attractive to build. |\n| **Risk management** | Without vacancy\u2011decontrol, a landlord faces **price\u2011risk**: if the market goes down, they could be forced to lower rents dramatically after a turnover. Vacancy\u2011decontrol eliminates that risk because the rent ceiling stays forever. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011level decisions** | Investors compare rent\u2011controlled assets to other asset classes. The **ability to \u201cunlock\u201d higher rents at each turnover** boosts the expected return, influencing whether they buy, hold, or sell rental properties. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. The 1994 San\u202fFrancisco change \u2013 what the law actually did  \n\n| Before 1994 (pre\u2011Costa\u2011Hawkins) | After 1994 (post\u2011Costa\u2011Hawkins repeal) |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Rent control** applied to pre\u20111979 units **and** **new\u2011construction** units built after 1979, **but** when a tenant left, the unit **became market\u2011rate** (vacancy\u2011decontrol). | **Rent control** continued to apply to **all pre\u20111994 units** *including* those built after 1979, **and** the rent ceiling **stayed in place after turnover** (no vacancy\u2011decontrol). |\n| Landlords could **reset rents** at each vacancy, often raising them by 30\u201150\u202f% in a single move. | Landlords could only raise rents **by the annual allowable increase** (initially 5\u202f% plus CPI, later capped at ~7\u202f%). A unit that was $1,200 in 1993 could be $1,250 in 1995, even if the market was $2,200. |\n| The law **exempted** \u201cluxury\u201d units (rent >\u202f$2,500) and **new\u2011construction** (post\u20111995) from control. | The same exemptions remained, but **the",

The basic rule\u2011book\n\n| Term | Legal definition (San\u202fFrancisco example) | What a landlord can do when a tenant leaves |\n|------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Rent\u2011control ceiling** | A maximum rent that a landlord may charge a *continuing* tenant. In SF (pre\u20111994) the ceiling was **10\u202f%\u202f+\u202fCPI** (capped at 7\u202f% for \u201cuncontrolled\u201d units). | The landlord **must** keep the rent at or below the ceiling **as long as the same tenant stays**. |\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol** | A \u201crelease clause\u201d that says **once a unit becomes vacant, the rent\u2011control status is terminated** and the landlord may set a *new* market rent for the next tenant. | The landlord can **reset the rent to whatever the market will bear**, after which the unit is again subject to the ceiling (if it is still covered by the original rent\u2011control ordinance). |\n| **Rent\u2011stabilization (post\u20111994)** | The same ceiling (10\u202f%\u202f+\u202fCPI) **but no de\u2011control**; a unit that ever entered the rent\u2011control roster stays on it forever, even after every turnover. | The landlord **cannot reset** the rent to market; every new tenant inherits the same ceiling\u2011adjusted rent that the previous tenant paid (plus the allowed annual increase). |\n\n### 2. Why vacancy\u2011decontrol mattered to landlords (economic intuition)\n\n| Step | Before 1994 (with vacancy\u2011decontrol) | After 1994 (without vacancy\u2011decontrol) |\n|------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **1. Revenue expectation** | A landlord could *periodically* capture the market rent by waiting for a vacancy. The \u201cpotential upside\u201d was the difference between the capped rent and the market rent at the next turnover. | The landlord loses that periodic upside; the only way to raise revenue is the modest annual ceiling increase (10\u202f%\u202f+\u202fCPI). |\n| **2. Investment calculus** | When deciding whether to build a new rental building, developers compare **expected net operating income (NOI)** to construction cost. The de\u2011control provision adds a *future* \u201cwindfall\u201d to the NOI stream, making the project more attractive. | Without de\u2011control, the projected NOI is lower and more predictable (no windfall). The **internal rate of return (IRR)** falls, sometimes below the hurdle rate that private developers require. |\n| **3. Risk and financing** | Lenders view a rent\u2011controlled asset with vacancy\u2011decontrol as **less risky** because there is a built\u2011in \u201cescape valve\u201d that can restore market rents if the market turns upward. | Lenders see a higher risk of long\u2011run cash\u2011flow suppression, which can raise financing costs (higher interest rates, larger equity required). |\n| **4.
