      "unknown_model_response": "## Overview  \n\nThe American Civil War (1861\u20111865) did not erupt because of a single cause; it was the result of a complex web of political, economic, social, and ideological forces that grew together over decades.  Historians have debated the relative weight of these forces since the war ended, and the balance of the scholarly consensus has shifted as new evidence and new interpretive frameworks have emerged.  Below is a synthesis of the most widely\u2011cited factors, the strongest arguments that scholars on different \u201csides\u201d have made, where the academic community now largely agrees, and where genuine uncertainty or disagreement remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Slavery \u2013 The Central, Irreconcilable Conflict  \n\n### Evidence & Arguments  \n\n| Perspective | Core claim | Supporting evidence |\n|------------|------------|----------------------|\n| **Traditional (and present\u2011day consensus) view** | Slavery was the primary cause; the war was fought over the existence and expansion of the institution of chattel slavery. | \u2022 The *Declarations of Causes* of seceding states (e.g., South Carolina, Mississippi, Texas) explicitly cite \u201cthe non\u2011intervention of the Federal Government in the protection of slavery\u201d and \u201cthe threat to the institution of slavery.\u201d<br>\u2022 The 1860 Republican platform demanded \u201cno extension of slavery\u201d and called the spread of slavery \u201cthe most dangerous threat to the Union.\u201d<br>\u2022 The *Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act* (1854), *Dred Scott* decision (1857), and the *Lincoln\u2011Douglas debates* show slavery\u2019s centrality in national politics.<br>\u2022 Economic data show that the Southern economy was overwhelmingly dependent on slave\u2011produced cotton (\u2248 45\u202f% of U.S. exports by 1860). |\n| **Economic\u2011determinist revisionists (late 19th\u2013early 20th\u202fc.)** | Slavery was a \u201csecondary\u201d factor; the war was primarily a clash of two different economic systems (industrial North vs. agrarian South). | \u2022 Comparative statistics on manufacturing output, railroad mileage, and banking concentration illustrate a widening North\u2011South economic divergence.<br>\u2022 Tariff debates (e.g., the Tariff of 1828 \u201cTariff of Abominations\u201d) reveal deep sectional resentment over protectionist policies that benefited Northern manufacturers at Southern expense. |\n| **\u201cStates\u2019 Rights\u201d proponents (often political\u2011conservative interpretation)** | The war was fought over the constitutional principle that states could nullify federal law and secede; slavery was only a symptom. | \u2022 Southern political rhetoric (e.g., John C. Calhoun\u2019s \u201cnullification\u201d theory, the \u201cDoctrine of Secession\u201d) framed the conflict as a defense of state sovereignty.<br>\u2022 The Confederacy\u2019s constitution explicitly protected state sovereignty and limited central power. |\n| **Cultural\u2011identity scholars (late 20th\u202fc.)** | The war reflected a clash of distinct regional cultures\u2014Southern \u201chonor\u201d and \u201cpatriarchal\u201d society versus Northern \u201cprogressive\u201d individualism. | \u2022 Literary and social\u2011history evidence (e.g., Southern planter memoirs, Northern abolitionist press) shows divergent world\u2011views that hardened over time. |\n\n### Scholarly Consensus  \n\n- **Virtually all professional historians today place slavery at the heart of the conflict**.  The *American Historical Association*, the *Organization of American Historians*, and major textbooks (e.g., *The Civil War: A Narrative* by Shelby Foote; *Battle Cry of Freedom* by James McPherson) identify slavery\u2014its moral, economic, and political dimensions\u2014as the \u201cprimary cause.\u201d  \n- The \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d narrative is recognized as **a rhetorical reframing** that emerged after the war (especially during the Lost\u2011Cause movement of the 1890s) to soften the moral stigma of slavery.  While constitutional disputes were real, they were **inextricably linked to the defense of slavery**; the right to secede was asserted precisely to protect the slave system.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Economic Divergence & Tariff Policy  \n\n### Evidence & Arguments  \n\n| Perspective | Core claim | Supporting evidence |\n|------------|------------|----------------------|\n| **Tariff\u2011conflict thesis** | The North\u2019s protectionist tariffs (e.g., 1828, 1832, 1857) harmed the Southern export\u2011oriented economy, fueling sectional antagonism. | \u2022 Congressional voting records show a consistent North\u2011South split on tariff bills.<br>\u2022 Southern",
