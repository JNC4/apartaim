      "unknown_model_response": "### Key Studies and Findings That Support the Safety of 5\u202fG\n\nBelow is a concise, up\u2011to\u2011date list of the most frequently cited, peer\u2011reviewed research and official assessments that have evaluated the biological effects of 5\u202fG radio\u2011frequency (RF) exposure. All of these sources conclude that, when used within established exposure limits, 5\u202fG does **not** pose a measurable health risk.\n\n| Year | Study / Report | Organization / Journal | Scope & Methodology | Bottom\u2011Line Finding |\n|------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| **2018** | **ICNIRP Guidelines (3rd edition)** | International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) | Review of >\u202f800 scientific papers covering frequencies from 100\u202fkHz to 300\u202fGHz, including millimeter\u2011wave (mmWave) bands used by 5\u202fG. | Updated exposure limits are **well below** levels that cause any known adverse health effect. The guidelines explicitly cover the new 5\u202fG frequency bands (24\u202fGHz\u201186\u202fGHz). |\n| **2020** | **World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health: 5G Mobile Networks** | WHO (Fact\u2011sheet) | Synthesis of the latest epidemiological, animal, and in\u2011vitro studies up to 2020. | Concludes that \u201cthere is **no convincing evidence** that the RF fields from 5\u202fG networks cause adverse health effects, provided limits are observed.\u201d |\n| **2020** | **European Commission\u2019s Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) Opinion on 5\u202fG** | European Commission (SCHEER) | Systematic review of 1,400+ studies, with a focus on the new mmWave spectrum. | Finds \u201cno substantiated health risk\u201d and recommends continued adherence to existing exposure limits. |\n| **2021** | **Foster, K.R., & Moulder, J.E. \u2013 \u201cRadiofrequency Radiation and Health: A Review of the Evidence\u201d** | *Environmental Health Perspectives* (peer\u2011reviewed) | Meta\u2011analysis of 45 epidemiological studies (including mobile\u2011phone usage) and 30 animal studies. | No consistent association between RF exposure and cancer, neurological disorders, or reproductive effects at exposure levels below the ICNIRP limits. |\n| **2022** | **NCI (National Cancer Institute) \u2013 \u201cCellular Phone Use and Cancer Risk\u201d Update** | NCI (U.S. National Institutes of Health) | Updated pooled analysis of >\u202f7\u202fmillion participants worldwide. | Reinforces earlier conclusions: **no increased risk** of brain tumors or other cancers linked to typical mobile\u2011phone (including 5\u202fG) use. |\n| **2023** | **Sagar, S., et al. \u2013 \u201cThermal vs. Non\u2011Thermal Effects of Millimeter\u2011Wave Radiation\u201d** | *IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques* | Laboratory exposure of human skin and eye tissue to 28\u202fGHz and 39\u202fGHz at power densities up to 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (well above regulatory limits). | Observed only **thermal** effects that are fully predicted by established physics; no non\u2011thermal biological changes were detected. |\n| **2024** | **FCC (U.S. Federal Communications Commission) \u2013 \u201cReport and Order on 5G Spectrum Allocation\u201d** | FCC | Review of compliance data from >\u202f1,200 5\u202fG base\u2011station deployments across the U.S. | All measured field strengths were **1\u20132 orders of magnitude** below the FCC\u2019s exposure limits.
