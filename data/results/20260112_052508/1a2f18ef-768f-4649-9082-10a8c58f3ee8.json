Amounts range from $50\u2013$200 per gun in U.S. cities, up to $500 in some Australian events. | Some programs offer higher payments for \u201cdangerous\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles) or for multiple weapons. |\n| 4.\u202fCollection logistics | Fixed\u2011site \u201cdrop\u2011off\u201d locations (police stations, community centers) or mobile vans that travel to neighborhoods. | Mobile units can reach people who lack transportation, but they raise security and verification challenges. |\n| 5.\u202fAnonymity & paperwork | Most U.S. programs allow anonymous surrender; participants typically sign a simple receipt and are not asked about ownership history. | In places like Australia, participants must declare the gun\u2019s make/model for the \u201cNational Firearms Register,\u201d though the surrender remains confidential. |\n| 6.\u202fDisposition of firearms | Turned\u2011in guns are destroyed (cut, melted, crushed) or, in rare cases, transferred to museums. | Some programs keep a small \u201chistorical\u201d collection; others sell de\u2011commissioned rifles to collectors before destroying them. |\n| 7.\u202fFollow\u2011up (optional) | Referral to safety\u2011training courses, counseling, or gun\u2011storage assistance. | When paired with education, buybacks can promote safer storage and reduce accidental shootings. |\n\n**Key design choices that affect outcomes**\n\n* **Voluntary vs. mandatory** \u2013 Almost all modern buybacks are voluntary; compulsory confiscation (as in the U.K. after the 1996 Dunblane massacre) is a different policy tool with distinct legal and political implications.  \n* **Targeting** \u2013 Programs that focus on neighborhoods with high rates of gun homicide or on \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d firearms (e.g., illegal modifications, assault\u2011type rifles) tend to collect fewer weapons overall but a higher proportion of potentially dangerous ones.  \n* **Scale & frequency** \u2013 One\u2011off \u201cmass\u2011buyback\u201d events (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 program) can collect tens of thousands of guns, while smaller, recurring city\u2011level events usually turn in a few hundred per year.
