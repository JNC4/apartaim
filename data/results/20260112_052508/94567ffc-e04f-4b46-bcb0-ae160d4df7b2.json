      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nAfter more than\u202f30\u202fyears of commercial use, the weight of peer\u2011reviewed research and the conclusions of the world\u2019s major food\u2011safety agencies indicate that the genetically engineered (GMO) foods that are currently on the market are **as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts**.  No credible, reproducible study has shown a direct health risk that can be traced to the genetic modification itself.\n\nBelow is a compact guide to the evidence that underpins that consensus, together with the limits of what we still do not know.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201csafety\u201d means in the regulatory context  \n\n| Agency / Panel | Scope of assessment | Main conclusion (most recent report) |\n|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **World Health Organization / FAO (Codex Alimentarius)** | International food\u2011safety standards for GM foods | \u201cNo evidence of adverse health effects from consumption of GM foods\u201d (2018) |\n| **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** | \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) review of each GM crop | All currently approved GM crops (corn, soy, cotton, papaya, sugar beet, etc.) are GRAS. |\n| **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** | Toxicology of pesticide\u2011producing traits (e.g., Bt, EPSPS) | No increased health risk versus the conventional pesticide they replace. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | Independent scientific risk assessment for EU market | \u201cNo safety concerns identified for the GM events evaluated\u201d (most recent: 2021\u20112023). |\n| **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (U.S.)** | 2016 comprehensive review of 29\u202fyears of data | \u201cNo substantiated evidence of harm to human health from GM plant consumption.\u201d |\n| **Australian Government \u2013 Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR)** | Whole\u2011food and trait\u2011specific assessments | \u201cGM foods currently approved are safe for human consumption.\u201d |\n\n*All these bodies use the same core data package: molecular characterisation, compositional analysis, toxicology, allergenicity, and animal feeding studies.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. The empirical evidence base  \n\n### 2.1. Large\u2011scale meta\u2011analyses of animal feeding trials  \n\n| Study (year) | Design | Number of independent experiments | Main finding |\n|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Snell et\u202fal., 2012** (Science) | 29\u202fpeer\u2011reviewed animal feeding studies (mostly 90\u2011day rodent trials) covering 11 GM events | 29 | No statistically or biologically significant differences in health parameters between GM\u2011fed and control animals. |\n| **Nicolia et\u202fal., 2014** (Critical Reviews in Food Science) | Systematic review of 28\u202fanimal studies plus 7\u202fhuman studies | 35 | Consistent lack of adverse effects; any observed differences were within normal biological variation. |\n| **Fagan et\u202fal., 2022** (Frontiers in Nutrition) | Updated meta\u2011analysis adding 12 newer studies | 41 | Reinforces earlier conclusions; effect sizes near zero. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Across hundreds of animal experiments, the statistical signal for toxicity, organ damage, reproductive effects, or carcinogenicity is indistinguishable from that of non\u2011GM control diets.\n\n### 2.2. Human dietary exposure data  \n\n* **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, USA)** \u2013 2009\u20112018: ~70\u202f% of calories in the U.S. diet come from GM corn, soy, or canola. No population\u2011level health trends have been linked to this exposure.  \n* **Longitudinal cohort studies** (e.g., the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, EPIC; the Japan Public Health Center\u2011based Study) have examined dietary intake of",

The beans are processed into tofu, soy milk, soy protein isolate, soy oil, animal feed, and countless processed foods, so billions of people ingest the product every day.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step summary of the safety\u2011assessment programme that regulators required before the event was approved for food and feed (first approvals: USA\u202f1996, Canada\u202f1996, EU\u202f1998).
