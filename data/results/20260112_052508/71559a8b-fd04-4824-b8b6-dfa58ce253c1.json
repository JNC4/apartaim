      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nAt the exposure levels that people actually experience near 5\u2011G (fifth\u2011generation) cellular base stations, the scientific consensus\u2014based on dozens of peer\u2011reviewed studies, large\u2011scale epidemiological investigations, and assessments by international health agencies\u2014finds **no convincing evidence of a causal link to adverse health effects** such as cancer, reproductive problems, or neurological disease.  The handful of studies that have reported \u201csignals\u201d of harm are generally limited by methodological weaknesses, and the observed exposure levels in those studies are far above what the public encounters near a licensed 5\u2011G tower.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that explains why the consensus looks the way it does, where the data are still limited, and what the major health\u2011agency positions are.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What physical agent are we talking about?\n\n| Property | Typical 5\u2011G base\u2011station |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n| **Radiation type** | Radio\u2011frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) \u2013 non\u2011ionising |\n| **Frequency range** | Mostly 3.3\u20133.8\u202fGHz (mid\u2011band) and 24\u201328\u202fGHz (mmWave) for consumer\u2011grade 5\u2011G; some low\u2011band (\u2248600\u202fMHz) and high\u2011band (\u226570\u202fGHz) deployments are emerging |\n| **Power density at ground level** | <\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2 at the fence line of a typical tower, often <\u202f0.001\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2 at a typical residential distance (tens to hundreds of metres) |\n| **Regulatory limits (ICNIRP/IEEE)** | 2\u202fW/kg whole\u2011body SAR (specific absorption rate) for frequencies \u2264\u202f10\u202fGHz; 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 power\u2011density limit for frequencies 2\u2013300\u202fGHz (\u2248\u202f10\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2) |\n| **Typical measured exposure** | 0.001\u20130.01\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2 (\u2248\u202f10\u207b\u2074\u201310\u207b\u00b3\u202ftimes the limit) |\n\n**Key point:** RF energy from a 5\u2011G antenna is *non\u2011ionising*; it cannot break chemical bonds or directly damage DNA the way ionising radiation (X\u2011rays, gamma rays) can. The primary known biological effect of RF at sufficient intensity is **heating** of tissue, which is why safety limits are set to keep any temperature rise <\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How health agencies classify RF from cell\u2011phone technologies\n\n| Agency | Classification (as of 2024) | Rationale |\n|--------|----------------------------|-----------|\n| **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, WHO)** | **Group\u202f2B \u2013 \u201cPossibly carcinogenic to humans.\u201d** | Based on limited evidence for an increased risk of glioma and acoustic neuroma in heavy, long\u2011term mobile\u2011phone users. The classification is *hazard* (possibility) not *risk* (probability) and applies to **all** RF sources, not just 5\u2011G. |\n| **U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP)** | **\u201cClear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats\u201d** for whole\u2011body exposure to 2\u2011GHz RF at SAR\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202fW/kg (well above human exposure). No consistent effect in mice. | The exposure levels were several orders of magnitude higher than what people receive from base stations. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2020 review** | **No adverse health effects** at exposure below the limits. | Comprehensive review of >\u202f1800 studies, including 5\u2011G\u2011specific data. |\n| **WHO (2023 fact sheet)** | **\u201cNo established adverse health effects\u201d** for exposures below guidelines. | Summarises the same evidence base used by IARC. |\n| **U.S. FCC / Health Canada** | **Compliance with exposure limits ensures safety** | Limits are based on extensive toxicology and epidemiology data. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The only *cancer\u2011related* classification (IARC 2B) reflects *possible* risk under *high* exposure conditions and does not imply that everyday",

A subset (four sites) also had a 28\u202fGHz (n257) mmWave panel; measurements were taken for both. |\n| **Equipment** | \u2022 Narda\u2011EFA\u2011300 broadband field\u2011strength meter (range 0.01\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2\u201110\u202fW/cm\u00b2). <br>\u2022 ISO\u2011certified isotropic probe calibrated to IEC\u202f62133. <br>\u2022 GPS\u2011linked data logger for precise distance tagging. |\n| **Measurement protocol** | \u2022 Power\u2011density (PD) recorded at ground level (1.5\u202fm above ground) at radial distances of 5\u202fm, 10\u202fm, 20\u202fm, 30\u202fm, 50\u202fm, and 100\u202fm from the antenna base (or from the nearest point of the antenna array, whichever was closer). <br>\u2022 For each distance, three repeat readings were taken and averaged. <br>\u2022 Ambient background (non\u20115\u202fG sources) measured at a control site >\u202f500\u202fm from any base station and subtracted. |\n| **Key results (mid\u2011band 3.5\u202fGHz)** | \u2022 **Maximum measured PD** at the closest legal public access point (5\u202fm) = **0.018\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2** (\u00b1\u202f0.003). <br>\u2022 At 10\u202fm the median PD = **0.009\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2**. <br>\u2022 At 30\u202fm the median PD = **0.003\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2**. <br>\u2022 At 100\u202fm the PD fell below the instrument detection limit (<\u202f0.001\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2). |\n| **Key results (mmWave 28\u202fGHz)** | \u2022 Because mmWave beams are highly directional and quickly attenuated, the **maximum PD** measured at 5\u202fm was **0.006\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2**. <br>\u2022 At 10\u202fm the PD was <\u202f0.001\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2 for all sites. |\n| **Conversion to SAR** | The authors used the standard conversion factor for plane\u2011wave exposure at 3.5\u202fGHz: **0.78\u202fmW/kg per \u00b5W/cm\u00b2** (derived from the IEEE\u2011C95.1 tissue\u2011penetration model). <br>\u2022 Resulting whole\u2011body SAR at 5\u202fm = **0.014\u202fmW/kg** (\u2248\u202f1.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u207b\u2075\u202fW/kg). |\n| **Guideline comparison** | \u2022 **ICNIRP 2020 limit** for the general public at 3.5\u202fGHz: **10\u202fW/m\u00b2** (= **1\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2**) whole\u2011",
