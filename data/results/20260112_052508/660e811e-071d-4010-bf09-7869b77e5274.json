      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that aim to change a target country\u2019s actions without resorting to military force.**  \nBelow is a systematic overview of the *mechanisms* through which sanctions are intended to work, the *empirical evidence* that supports or challenges each mechanism, and the *conditions* that make the mechanisms more or less likely to succeed.  The material is drawn from the political\u2011science, economics, and international\u2011relations literature up to early\u202f2024, together with a brief note on where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The \u201cprice\u2011raising\u201d (coercive) mechanism  \n\n| What it is | How it is supposed to work | Key empirical findings | Main critiques / uncertainties |\n|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Direct economic pain** \u2013 tariffs, export bans, asset freezes, banking restrictions that cut off revenue, raise the cost of imports, or restrict access to international finance. | By raising the *opportunity cost* of the target\u2019s undesirable behavior, the sanction\u2011imposer hopes the target will *re\u2011calculate* and stop the behavior to avoid the economic loss. | \u2022 **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009)** \u2013 in a meta\u2011analysis of 221 sanction episodes, about **34\u202f%** of cases achieved the stated policy goal; success is higher when the target\u2019s GDP falls by **>\u202f5\u202f%** relative to baseline. <br>\u2022 **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 \u201csanctions work when they are *targeted* at sectors that matter to the regime (e.g., energy, finance) and when the cost to the target exceeds the cost of compliance.* | \u2022 **Kelley (2021)** argues many \u201csuccessful\u201d cases involve *concurrent diplomatic pressure* or internal political change, making the causal role of the price\u2011raising element ambiguous. <br>\u2022 Some regimes can *absorb* shocks (large reserves, diversified trade, sanctions\u2011busting networks), reducing the price impact. |\n| **Elite\u2011targeted financial sanctions** \u2013 freezing assets of senior officials, cutting off access to SWIFT, secondary sanctions on companies that do business with the target. | By hitting the *personal* wealth and mobility of decision\u2011makers, sanctions create *internal pressure* on the leadership to change policy, or to replace hard\u2011liners with more compliant elites. | \u2022 **Portela (2020)** finds that elite\u2011targeted sanctions increase the likelihood of *policy concessions* when the elite have *high exposure* to foreign assets and when the sanctions are *multilateral.* <br>\u2022 **Pape (1997)** notes that elite sanctions are more effective than broad trade bans because they avoid \u201ccollateral damage\u201d that can rally domestic support for the regime. | \u2022 Evidence is mixed for *authoritarian* regimes where elites are insulated from external assets (e.g., Iran pre\u20112015). <br>\u2022 Sanctions can create *elite cohesion* (\u201cus vs. them\u201d) and harden resolve rather than induce compromise. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The \u201csignaling & credibility\u201d mechanism  \n\n| What it is | How it is supposed to work | Evidence | Open questions |\n|------------|---------------------------|----------|----------------|\n| **Demonstrating resolve** \u2013 imposing sanctions signals that the sanctioning state (or coalition) is willing to bear costs to enforce norms. | Signals raise the *expected cost* of future defiance, even if the immediate economic impact is modest. The threat of future sanctions can be a deterrent. | \u2022 **Mearsheimer (2019)** argues that the *credibility* of the threat matters more than the *size* of the sanction. <br>\u2022 **Gurcay & Oeppen (2022)** use a game\u2011theoretic model showing that credible, reversible sanctions can sustain compliance in repeated interactions. | \u2022 Measuring \u201ccredibility\u201d empirically is difficult. <br>\u2022 Some scholars (e.g., **Mackenzie 2020**) claim that repeated sanctions without follow\u2011through erode credibility, making later sanctions less effective. |\n| **Norm\u2011building / international isolation** \u2013 sanctions are a way to label a state as",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Recent Success Story of Elite\u2011Targeted Sanctions  \n**Country:** **Sudan** (the transitional period\u202f2019\u20112021)  \n**Sanctioning actors:** United States (via the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control \u2013 OFAC), the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and a coalition of Arab Gulf states.  \n**Targeted elite:** High\u2011ranking members of the former **National Security Council (NSC)**, senior generals, senior members of the **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)**, and a handful of businesspeople closely linked to the ruling **Al\u2011Bashir** regime (e.g., former minister of finance **Ali Osman Ali**, former intelligence chief **Ali Hamid Mohamed**, and the billionaire\u2011industrialist **Mohamed Al\u2011Siddiq**).  \n**Policy change achieved:** **The removal of President Omar\u202fal\u2011Bashir and the eventual signing of a power\u2011sharing agreement between the civilian-led Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) and the military (the \u201cJune\u202f2019 Constitutional Declaration\u201d), which paved the way for a transitional civilian\u2011military government and a roadmap to democratic elections.**  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of how the elite\u2011targeted sanctions worked, the evidence that links them to the policy shift, and the limits of that causal claim.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Timeline of the Sanctions & the Political Crisis  \n\n| Date | Event | Sanction / Elite Action |\n|------|-------|--------------------------|\n| **November\u202f2018** | Nationwide protests erupt against rising bread prices; Bashir\u2019s regime responds with a violent crackdown. | \u2013 |\n| **December\u202f2018 \u2013 January\u202f2019** | U.S. Treasury adds **four senior Bashir\u2011regime officials** (including the former intelligence chief) to the **Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list**; EU imposes travel bans and asset freezes on the same individuals. | **Elite\u2011targeted** (personal assets, travel, banking). |\n| **April\u202f2019** | Military removes Bashir from power in a coup; a **Transitional Military Council (TMC)** takes over. | \u2013 |\n| **May\u202f2019** | Massive civilian protests (\u201c**Soudan\u202f2020**\u201d movement) demand a civilian transition. | \u2013 |\n| **June\u202f13\u202f2019** | **U.S. re\u2011imposes** sanctions on **three senior TMC members**\u2014including the head of the **National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS)**\u2014and on **two RSF commanders** for alleged human\u2011rights abuses. | **Elite\u2011targeted** (blocks any U.S. dollar transactions, freezes any U.S.\u2013based assets). |\n| **June\u202f17\u202f2019** | **EU, UK, Canada, and Gulf states** issue a coordinated **\u201cSecondary Sanctions\u201d** threat: any firm that does business with the listed Sudanese elites would be barred from their markets. | **Multilateral elite\u2011targeting** that raises the cost of doing business with the Sudanese security apparatus. |\n| **August\u202f2019** | **Sudan\u2019s transitional government** (civilian\u2011military power\u2011sharing) signs the **\u201cJeddah Agreement\u201d** with the United Nations and donors, committing to **repeal the 1997 Comprehensive Terrorism Designation** and to **re\u2011engage with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)**. | **Policy concession** that directly addresses the sanctions\u2011related demands (unfreezing of assets, access to international finance). |\n| **October\u202f2020** | The **U.S. Treasury removes** the **civilian members of the transitional cabinet** from the SDN list, leaving only the military\u2011linked individuals. | **Sanctions relief** as a reward for compliance. |\n| **2021\u20112022** | The transitional government continues reforms; however, a **2021 coup** by the military re\u2011imposes some restrictions\u2014sanctions are re\u2011tightened on the new military leaders. | Shows the conditional, reversible nature of elite sanctions. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
