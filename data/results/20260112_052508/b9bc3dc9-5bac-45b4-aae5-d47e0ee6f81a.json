      "unknown_model_response": "Vaccines are biological preparations that train the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causing the disease itself. Here\u2019s a brief overview of how they work and what the scientific evidence says about their safety and benefits for children:\n\n### How Childhood Vaccines Work\n1. **Antigen Introduction**: Vaccines contain harmless pieces of a pathogen (such as proteins, sugars, or inactivated/killed organisms) or a blueprint (mRNA or viral vector) that instructs cells to produce a specific antigen.\n2. **Immune Activation**: When the antigen is introduced, the immune system responds by:\n   - Producing **antibodies** that can neutralize the pathogen.\n   - Activating **T\u2011cells**, which help coordinate the immune response and destroy infected cells.\n3. **Memory Formation**: After the initial response, the immune system creates memory B\u2011cells and T\u2011cells. If the child later encounters the real pathogen, these memory cells enable a rapid and robust response, often preventing illness altogether.\n\n### Evidence on Safety\n- **Rigorous Testing**: Every vaccine undergoes pre\u2011clinical studies, multiple phases of clinical trials, and continuous post\u2011licensure monitoring (e.g., VAERS, VSD, and international pharmacovigilance systems) to detect rare adverse events.\n- **Large\u2011Scale Studies**: Meta\u2011analyses involving millions of children have shown that serious adverse events from vaccines are exceedingly rare. For example:\n  - The risk of anaphylaxis after routine childhood vaccines is about 1 case per million doses.\n  - The incidence of severe neurological complications (e.g., encephalitis) is far lower than the risk of the same complications from the natural diseases they prevent.\n- **Transparency and Oversight**: Independent bodies such as the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, and national regulatory agencies continuously review safety data.\n\n### Proven Benefits\n- **Disease Prevention**: Vaccines have dramatically reduced or eradicated many childhood diseases:\n  - **Polio**: Cases dropped from hundreds of thousands annually to fewer than 200 worldwide.\n  - **Measles**: Global deaths decreased by over 80% since the introduction of the measles vaccine.\n  - **Whooping Cough (pertussis)**, **tetanus**, **diphtheria**, **haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb**, and **rotavirus** infections have all seen steep declines in incidence and mortality.\n- **Herd Immunity**: High vaccination coverage protects those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants too young for certain vaccines, immunocompromised individuals) by interrupting transmission chains.\n- **Economic Impact**: Preventing disease reduces healthcare costs, parental work loss, and long\u2011term disability expenses. The CDC estimates that every dollar spent on childhood vaccination saves about $3 in direct medical costs and $10",
