      "unknown_model_response": "**Why pediatricians (and most public\u2011health authorities) recommend vaccines**\n\n| Reason | What it means for a child and for society |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Prevention of serious disease** | Vaccines stop infections that can cause meningitis, pneumonia, paralysis, encephalitis, permanent organ damage, disability, or death. For example, before the measles vaccine was widely used, the U.S. saw ~500\u202fdeaths and >\u202f100\u202f000 hospitalizations each year; today those numbers are in the low\u2011double\u2011digits. |\n| **Protection of the whole community (herd immunity)** | When enough people are immune, the pathogen cannot spread easily, protecting babies too young to be vaccinated, children with immune\u2011system problems, and adults with chronic illnesses. The thresholds differ by disease (\u2248\u202f95\u202f% for measles, \u2248\u202f80\u202f% for pertussis). |\n| **Avoiding complications and long\u2011term sequelae** | Many vaccine\u2011preventable infections have hidden costs: hearing loss from meningitis, learning disabilities after encephalitis, chronic lung disease after severe RSV\u2011like bronchiolitis, or infertility myths that have no scientific basis. |\n| **Economic and social benefits** | A single dose of DTaP (diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis) costs a few dollars, while a hospital stay for severe pertussis can exceed\u202f$30\u202f000. Vaccinated children miss fewer school days, and families avoid costly medical bills and lost work. |\n| **Historical success and eradication goals** | Smallpox has been eradicated worldwide; polio is on the brink of global eradication. These achievements are only possible because vaccines are used consistently. |\n| **Regulatory and professional guidelines** | The CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the World Health Organization (WHO), and national pediatric societies base their schedules on a systematic review of the best available data. Doctors follow these guidelines to give patients the most effective, evidence\u2011based protection. |\n\n---\n\n**How safe are vaccines? \u2013 The evidence in a nutshell**\n\n| Safety aspect | What the data show |\n|---------------|--------------------|\n| **Pre\u2011licensure testing** | Every vaccine must pass three phases of clinical trials (Phase\u202fI\u2013III) that involve\u202f>\u202f10\u202f000 participants total, looking for common side\u2011effects and any signals of rare serious events. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and equivalent agencies worldwide review the data before a vaccine can be approved. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure surveillance** | After a vaccine is in use, millions of doses are monitored through systems such as: <br>\u2022 **VAERS** (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) \u2013 a national passive reporting system. <br>\u2022 **VSD** (Vaccine Safety Datalink) \u2013 active electronic\u2011health\u2011record monitoring of >\u202f12\u202fmillion people. <br>\u2022 **WHO\u2011GACVS** and **EU\u2011EudraVigilance** \u2013 international safety networks. These programs continually assess risk and can trigger investigations or changes in recommendations if a problem emerges. |\n| **Common (mild) reactions** | Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site; low\u2011grade fever; fussiness or mild rash. These usually resolve within 1\u20133\u202fdays and are a sign that the immune system is responding. |\n| **Serious adverse events** | Events such as anaphylaxis, seizures, or Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) are **extremely rare**. For example: <br>\u2022 Anaphylaxis after any childhood vaccine \u2248\u202f1\u202fcase per\u202f1\u202fmillion doses. <br>\u2022 Febrile seizures after the combined measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR) vaccine \u2248\u202f1\u202fcase per\u202f20\u202f000\u201130\u202f000 doses, and most children have no lasting effects. <br>\u2022 The risk of severe complications from the diseases themselves (e.g., measles encephalitis \u2248\u202f1\u202fcase per\u202f1\u202f000\u202f000 infections) is orders of magnitude higher than the vaccine\u2011related risk. |\n| **Long\u2011term safety** | Large cohort studies (e.g., the Danish National Birth Cohort, the U.S. Vaccine Safety Datalink",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Polio \u2013 How a childhood\u2011vaccination program turned a feared epidemic into a near\u2011global eradication\n\n| **Aspect** | **What the world looked like *before* the polio vaccine** | **What happened *after* routine childhood vaccination** |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Annual cases (global)** | 350\u202f000\u202f\u2013\u202f500\u202f000 paralytic cases per year in the 1950s (the \u201cpolio pandemics\u201d). In the United States alone, the peak year 1952 saw **57\u202f618** cases, 21\u202f000 of them in children under 5. | 2023: **22** confirmed cases worldwide (all in a handful of countries where vaccination coverage is still low). The United States reported **0** cases for the first time since the 1970s. |\n| **Deaths & permanent disability** | Mortality 5\u201110\u202f% of paralytic cases; many survivors left with permanent limb weakness, spinal\u2011muscle atrophy, or \u201cpost\u2011polio syndrome\u201d that appears decades later. In the U.S., the 1952 peak produced **\u2248\u202f3\u202f000 deaths** and **\u2248\u202f30\u202f000 children** with lasting paralysis. | In the post\u2011vaccine era, paralysis is now a rarity. The few recent cases have occurred in areas with <\u202f80\u202f% vaccine coverage; most patients recover fully because the virus is caught early and treated with modern intensive\u2011care support. |\n| **Public fear & social impact** | Polio was the most feared infectious disease of the 20th\u202fcentury. Summer \u201cpolio parties\u201d (parents deliberately exposing kids to the virus) were common, and schools, swimming pools, and public water supplies were closed during outbreaks. | The disease is no longer part of everyday conversation in most countries. The \u201cpolio\u2011free\u201d status of a nation is now a marker of a robust public\u2011health system. |\n| **Economic cost** | In the U.S., the 1952 epidemic cost **\u2248\u202f$500\u202fmillion** (\u2248\u202f$5\u202fbillion\u202ftoday) in hospital care, lost productivity, and long\u2011term disability support. Worldwide, the economic burden was in the tens of billions of dollars annually. | The annual cost of the global eradication effort (vaccines, surveillance, campaign logistics) is **\u2248\u202f$1\u202fbillion**\u2014far less than the cost of treating thousands of paralytic cases each year. |\n| **Vaccine(s) introduced** | \u2022 **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)** \u2013 developed by Jonas Salk, licensed in the U.S. in 1955.<br>\u2022 **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)** \u2013 live\u2011attenuated, introduced by Albert Sabin in 1961; easier to give and provides intestinal immunity, which is crucial for stopping transmission. | Most high\u2011income countries now use a **4\u2011dose IPV schedule** (at 2, 4, 6\u201318\u202fmonths, and a booster at 4\u20136\u202fyears). Many low\u2011 and middle\u2011income countries still use OPV in mass\u2011campaign rounds because it can stop virus spread in the community more quickly, but they have switched to the **bivalent OPV** (types\u202f1 &\u202f3) and are now introducing IPV to eliminate the rare risk of vaccine\u2011derived poliovirus. |\n| **Current status (2024)** | - Endemic transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) still occurs in **Afghanistan** and **Pakistan** (\u2248\u202f1\u202f000\u202fcases in the last 5\u202fyears). <br>- **Vaccine\u2011derived poliovirus** (cVDPV) outbreaks have appeared in places where OPV coverage dropped below the herd\u2011immunity threshold (\u2248\u202f80\u201185\u202f%). | - The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) aims for **complete eradication by 2030**. <br>- In the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and most of Asia, polio is declared *eliminated* (no endemic transmission for >\u202f3\u202fyears). <br>- Surveillance (environmental sampling of sewage, acute flaccid paralysis reporting) continues to ensure any re\u2011introduction is caught early. |\n\n---\n\n#### How the vaccine made the difference\n\n1. **Mass immunisation campaigns** \u2013 Within a decade of IPV\u2019s introduction, U.S.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) vs. Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)\n\n| Feature | **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)** | **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)** |\n|---------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Formulation** | Live\u2011attenuated (weakened) poliovirus strains (usually types\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3) suspended in a liquid that is taken by mouth. | Killed (formalin\u2011inactivated) whole\u2011virus particles grown in cell culture, packaged in a sterile injection. |\n| **How it \u201cteaches\u201d the immune system** | 1. The attenuated virus replicates in the **intestinal mucosa** (the natural site where wild poliovirus multiplies). <br>2. This stimulates **local (IgA) immunity** in the gut, which blocks the virus from being shed in stool and from spreading to others. <br>3. The virus also enters the bloodstream, provoking a systemic antibody response (IgG) that protects the nervous system from paralysis. | 1. The killed virus is taken up by immune cells at the injection site. <br>2. It triggers a **systemic (IgG) antibody response** that prevents the virus from reaching the central nervous system if a person is later infected. <br>3. Because the virus does **not** replicate in the gut, it does **not** induce strong intestinal (IgA) immunity. |\n| **Dosing schedule** | Usually 2\u20133 doses given at 6\u2011week intervals (historically \u201ctriple\u2011dose\u201d schedule). In many eradication campaigns a **single\u2011dose** mass\u2011vaccination round is given, followed by routine doses later. | 4\u2011dose schedule in the United States (2\u202fmo, 4\u202fmo, 6\u201118\u202fmo, booster at 4\u20136\u202fyr). Other countries may use 3\u2011dose schedules (0, 1\u20132, 6\u202fmo) plus a booster. |\n| **Cold\u2011chain & administration** | Very easy to give: a few drops on a sugar\u2011cube, a piece of bread, or directly onto the tongue. The vaccine is **stable at relatively high temperatures** for short periods, which eases logistics in remote areas. | Requires a sterile syringe and trained health\u2011care worker, and the product must stay refrigerated (2\u20118\u202f\u00b0C) from manufacture to injection. |\n| **Cost** | Roughly **$0.10\u2013$0.15 per dose** (bulk price). | About **$1\u2013$2 per dose** in low\u2011income\u2011country procurement, higher in high\u2011income markets. |\n| **Safety profile** | \u2022 Very safe for the vast majority of children.<br>\u2022 **Rare adverse event:** vaccine\u2011derived poliovirus (VDPV). In <\u202f1\u202fin\u202f2.5\u202fmillion doses the attenuated virus can mutate and regain neurovirulence, causing paralysis in unvaccinated or under\u2011vaccinated contacts.<br>\u2022 Extremely low risk of allergic reaction. | \u2022 No risk of VDPV because the virus is dead.<br>\u2022 Small risk of **anaphylaxis** (\u2248\u202f1\u202fcase per\u202f1\u202fmillion doses).<br>\u2022 No live virus, so it is safe for immunocompromised children. |\n| **Impact on transmission** | Because it creates strong gut immunity, OPV can **interrupt person\u2011to\u2011person spread** in a community after just one dose. This property made it the work\u2011horse of the global eradication effort. | Provides excellent protection against paralytic disease but **does not stop intestinal replication** as well; a vaccinated person could still shed wild virus if exposed, although the amount is much lower than in an unvaccinated person. |\n| **Current global use (2024)** | \u2022 **bivalent OPV (bOPV)** \u2013 contains only types\u202f1 and\u202f3 (type\u202f2 was removed in 2016 because wild type\u202f2 was declared eradicated and the type\u202f2 component was the main source of VDPV). <br>\u2022 Used in **mass\u2011campaign rounds** in countries where wild poliovirus still circulates or where cVDPV outbreaks occur. <br>\u2022 Some countries (e.g., India, Pakistan, Afghanistan) still give OPV as part of routine immunisation, often **combined with at least one dose of IPV** to give both gut and systemic immunity. | \u2022 Used universally in **high\u2011income countries** (U.S., Canada, EU, Australia, Japan, etc.) and increasingly",
