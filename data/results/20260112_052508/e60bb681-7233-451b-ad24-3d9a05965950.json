The macro\u2011step: QE lowers long\u2011term interest rates  \n\n| Event | What the central bank does | Immediate market effect |\n|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **QE round** (e.g., \u201cQE\u20113\u201d in the U.S., March\u202f2019) | The Federal Reserve announces it will buy **$600\u202fbillion** of 10\u2011year Treasury bonds and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS) each month for 6\u202fmonths. | \u2022 The extra demand pushes up bond prices \u2192 yields fall.<br>\u2022 The 10\u2011year Treasury yield drops from about **2.8\u202f%** to **2.3\u202f%**.<br>\u2022 The average yield on newly\u2011issued agency MBS (the benchmark for most mortgages) falls from **3.2\u202f%** to **2.7\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f50\u202fbasis\u2011points). |\n\n*Why does this matter?*  \nCommercial banks and mortgage lenders fund a large part of their loan books by borrowing in the wholesale market (e.g., issuing their own bonds, borrowing from the Fed\u2019s discount window, or taking on deposits). When the **cost of those funds falls**, they can afford to extend new loans at lower rates while still protecting their profit margin.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The banking\u2011side transmission  \n\n1. **Bank balance\u2011sheet impact**  \n   * A midsize regional bank holds $10\u202fbn of Treasury securities. After QE, the market price of those securities rises, giving the bank a **$200\u202fmillion unrealized gain** (\u2248\u202f2\u202f%).  \n   * The gain raises the bank\u2019s capital ratio, making regulators more comfortable with additional lending.  \n\n2. **Funding cost falls**  \n   * The bank\u2019s cost of raising funds in the wholesale market (e.g., issuing a 10\u2011year bond) falls by roughly the same amount as Treasury yields \u2013 **\u2248\u202f45\u202fbp**.  \n\n3. **Risk\u2011adjusted pricing decision**  \n   * The bank uses a simple pricing formula:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Mortgage rate} = \\text{Funding cost} + \\text{Credit spread} + \\text{Administrative margin}\n\\]\n\n   * Before QE: Funding cost = 2.8\u202f% (10\u2011yr Treasury), Credit spread (for a borrower with a 660 FICO) = 1.0\u202f%, Margin = 0.3\u202f% \u2192 **4.1\u202f%** mortgage rate.  \n   * After QE: Funding cost = 2.35\u202f% (down 45\u202fbp), same credit spread & margin \u2192 **3.65\u202f%** mortgage rate.  \n\n   *The bank can still earn the same margin, but the borrower pays **45 basis points** less per year.*\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Credit\u2011supply side:** QE also expands the \u201cbalance\u2011sheet\u201d of the **Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window** and **term\u2011repo facilities**, giving banks a cheap source of funding that they can pass on to borrowers. | **Empirical finding:** In the Euro\u2011area, the \u201cbank\u2011loan\u2011to\u2011GDP\u201d ratio rose by **\u2248\u202f3\u202fpp** during the 2015\u20112018 QE program, with the strongest gains in the **SME\u2011loan** segment (ECB, *Financial Stability Review*, 2020). |\n| **4. Down\u2011stream:** Banks lower the **interest rate** on new loans and may relax **collateral** or **down\u2011payment** requirements for borrowers with modest credit histories (though this is heavily mediated by risk\u2011appetite). | **Empirical finding:** The share of SBA 7(a) loans (the main U.S. government\u2011backed small\u2011business loan program) approved for **\u201clow\u2011credit\u201d borrowers** (FICO\u202f<\u202f620) rose from **12\u202f%** in 2011 to **16\u202f%** in 2015, a period that overlaps with QE2 and QE3 (U.S. SBA Office of Advocacy, ",
