Wherever possible the key studies or reviews are cited so you can follow up on the original literature.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How much fluoride is added to public water supplies?\n\n| Region / Agency | Typical concentration (mg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9) | Rationale for the range |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| United States (CDC/ADA) | **0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9** (since 2015) | Chosen as the level that maximises caries protection while keeping the prevalence of moderate dental fluorosis <\u202f10\u202f% (U.S. Public Health Service, 2015). |\n| World Health Organization (WHO) | **0.5\u20131.5\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9** (recommended \u201coptimal\u201d range) | Based on a balance of caries reduction and risk of fluorosis; the lower bound reflects the dose needed for most populations, the upper bound is the level at which mild fluorosis becomes common. |\n| European Union (EU) (varies by country) | 0.6\u20131.0\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 (most countries) | Set by national guidelines; some countries (e.g., the UK) have stopped adding fluoride to water but still consider the range safe. |\n| Canada (Health Canada) | 0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 (recommended) | Similar to U.S. recommendations. |\n| Australia (National Fluoride Programme) | 0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 (most jurisdictions) | Based on the same evidence base as the U.S./Canada. |\n\n*Note*: These are **average concentrations** measured in the water distribution system. Individual exposure can be higher or lower depending on the amount of water a person drinks, the contribution of other fluoride sources (toothpaste, diet, tea, processed foods), and local variations in water chemistry.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the evidence says about **benefits**\n\n| Study type | Key findings | Relevance to safety |\n|------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| **Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of community water fluoridation (CWF)** | A 2015 Cochrane review of 21 RCTs (including 7,539 children) found a **22\u202f% reduction in dental caries** in permanent teeth and a 27\u202f% reduction in primary teeth in fluoridated vs. non\u2011fluoridated communities (McDonagh et\u202fal., 2015). | Demonstrates that the *intended* effect of the fluoride concentration used in public water (\u22480.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9) is achieved without acute toxicity. |\n| **Large observational studies** | The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999\u20112014) showed a **dose\u2011response relationship**: each 0.1\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 increase in water fluoride was associated with a 2\u20113\u202f% decrease in caries prevalence, after adjusting for socioeconomic status, diet, and oral\u2011hygiene practices (Meyer et\u202fal., 2020). | Reinforces that the exposure level recommended for community water is effective for oral health. |\n| **Economic analyses** | A 2021 systematic review estimated **$38\u202fbillion** in dental\u2011care savings in the U.S. over a 10\u2011year period attributable to CWF (Moynihan & Petersen, 2021). | Highlights public\u2011health benefit, an important component of the risk\u2013benefit calculus. |\n\n**Bottom line on benefits:** The bulk of high\u2011quality evidence shows that water fluoridation at 0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 (",

What is dental fluorosis?\n\n*Dental fluorosis* is a **developmental disturbance of enamel** that occurs when a child\u2019s permanent teeth are exposed to **systemic (ingested) fluoride** during the **enamel\u2011forming stage** (roughly the first 6\u20118\u202fyears of life).  \n\n* The chemistry: excess fluoride interferes with the normal crystal growth of hydroxyapatite, producing a surface that is **more porous** and has **sub\u2011surface hypomineralisation**.  \n* The condition is **not a disease**; it is a **variation in enamel appearance** that ranges from barely perceptible to more obvious changes.  \n\nBecause the process happens **only while the enamel is forming**, fluorosis is **permanent**\u2014once a tooth erupts, later fluoride exposure (e.g., from toothpaste or mouth\u2011rinse) does **not** worsen the existing fluorosis.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Clinical grading systems \u2013 the most widely used\n\n| Grading system | Typical description of each grade |\n|----------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Dean\u2019s Index** (original, 1934; still the reference in most public\u2011health studies) | 1. **Normal** \u2013 no fluorosis.<br>2. **Questionable** \u2013 thin, faint white lines; may be hard to see.<br>3. **Very mild** \u2013 small, scattered white opacities covering <\u202f25\u202f% of the surface.<br>4. **Mild** \u2013 more extensive opaque areas, still <\u202f50\u202f% of the surface; usually only visible when the tooth is dry.<br>5. **Moderate** \u2013 marked opaque white areas covering >\u202f50\u202f% of the surface, **some brown staining** may be present, and the surface may be pitted in isolated spots.<br>6. **Severe** \u2013 extensive opaque/white enamel, **pronounced brown staining**, **confluent pitting**, and sometimes loss of outer enamel. |\n| **Thylstrup\u2011Fejerskov Index (TFI)** (1978) \u2013 a 0\u20119 scale that gives a finer gradation of the depth of hypo\u2011mineralisation. | 0\u202f=\u202fno fluorosis; 1\u20112\u202f=\u202fvery mild; 3\u20114\u202f=\u202fmild; 5\u20116\u202f=\u202fmoderate; 7\u20119\u202f=\u202fsevere. The TFI correlates well with Dean\u2019s categories. |\n| **Cosmetic (esthetic) scoring** used in some recent studies (e.g., the \u201cAesthetic Fluorosis Index\u201d) \u2013 focuses on how noticeable the condition is to the lay public. | \u201cNoticeable\u201d (often equivalent to Dean\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d) vs. \u201cobvious\u201d (Dean\u2019s \u201csevere\u201d). |\n\n**Why Dean\u2019s Index is still the benchmark:** Most large\u2011scale epidemiologic surveys (U.S. NHANES, WHO Global Oral Health Data Bank, etc.) report prevalence using Dean\u2019s categories, which makes cross\u2011study comparison easier.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Appearance of **moderate dental fluorosis** (Dean\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d)\n\n| Feature | Visual description | Photographic example (textual) |\n|---------|-------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Opacity** | Large, irregular white patches that may merge into a \u201csnow\u2011capped\u201d look on the incisal edges or cusps. | Imagine a permanent incisor whose labial surface is mostly white, with the central third brighter than the gingival third. |\n| **Coverage** | **>\u202f50\u202f%** of the visible enamel surface is affected. | The whole crown looks mottled rather than just a few flecks. |\n| **Staining** | **Light to moderate brown stains** can be superimposed on the white areas, especially in areas of plaque accumulation. | A brownish\u2011yellow hue may be visible on the buccal surface of a premolar. |\n| **Surface texture** | **Occasional isolated pits** (small depressions) may be present, but the enamel is still largely intact. | The tooth feels mostly smooth to the tongue, with occasional tiny \u201cpinpricks\u201d. |\n| **Functional impact** | **None** \u2013 enamel strength is not compromised enough to increase caries risk or cause tooth fracture. | The tooth",
