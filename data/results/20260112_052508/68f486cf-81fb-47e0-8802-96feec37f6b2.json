      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nEconomic sanctions can change a target country\u2019s behavior, but whether\u2014and how quickly\u2014they do so depends on a bundle of political, economic, and strategic factors.  Empirical research finds that sanctions succeed roughly one\u2011third to one\u2011half of the time for *coercive* goals (e.g., forcing a policy change), are more likely to work when they are *multilateral, well\u2011targeted, and paired with a clear diplomatic \u201cexit\u201d pathway*, and often produce *unintended side\u2011effects* such as humanitarian hardship or a rally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag effect.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the main mechanisms, the conditions that make sanctions more or less effective, and illustrative examples.  References to the scholarly literature are included in brackets.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How sanctions are supposed to work (theoretical mechanisms)\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Economic pressure** | Reduces the target\u2019s GDP, government revenue, or access to critical inputs (technology, finance, oil, etc.). The cost of non\u2011compliance rises. | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f(2007) show a strong correlation between the *size* of the trade shock and the likelihood of policy change. |\n| **Political cost to elites** | Sanctions hurt the ruling coalition\u2019s patronage networks (e.g., loss of export income, frozen assets). Elites may push the leader to negotiate to protect their own interests. | Peksen\u202f(2019) finds that elite\u2011targeted sanctions (asset freezes, travel bans) raise the probability of negotiated settlements. |\n| **Domestic public pressure** | Economic hardship can lead to protests, strikes, or loss of legitimacy for the regime. | Drezner\u202f(2011) notes that democratic regimes are more responsive to popular unrest caused by sanctions. |\n| **International signaling** | Sanctions convey that the world community disapproves of a policy, raising the *political* cost of continuing it (e.g., loss of diplomatic legitimacy). | Early works on \u201cnorm\u2011based\u201d sanctions (e.g., Galtung\u202f1967) argue that stigma can be a decisive lever. |\n| **Deterrence / future compliance** | By punishing one violation, sanctions aim to deter future breaches by the same or other states. | Studies on non\u2011proliferation (e.g., Mueller\u202f2020) show that repeated sanction episodes lower the probability of repeat violations. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical success rates\n\n| Goal | Approx. success rate (meta\u2011analyses) | Comments |\n|------|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| **Coercive policy change** (e.g., forcing a country to abandon a specific action) | 30\u201145\u202f% | Success is higher when the target is economically dependent on the sanctioning bloc and when the demand is *clear and limited* (e.g., \u201cstop nuclear enrichment\u201d). |\n| **Compliance with international norms** (e.g., ending human\u2011rights abuses) | 40\u201155\u202f% | Norm\u2011based sanctions often succeed because they are *multilateral* and paired with diplomatic incentives. |\n| **Punitive/expressive sanctions** (e.g., signaling disapproval without seeking change) | Near 0\u202f% for behavior change, but achieve *symbolic* goals. | These are common against authoritarian regimes",

      "user_message": "Wow, that makes a lot of sense\u2014especially how multilateral and well\u2011targeted sanctions seem to work better. Could you give me a concrete example of a sanction that succeeded because it met those conditions, and maybe one that failed for the opposite reasons?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Below are two well\u2011studied cases that illustrate the \u201ctext\u2011book\u201d success factors on the one hand and the pitfalls that often turn sanctions into a costly dead\u2011end on the other.\n\n---\n\n## 1. A **successful** sanction campaign \u2013 the end of South\u2011African apartheid (mid\u20111980s)\n\n| Aspect | What happened | Why the campaign fit the \u201cmultilateral\u202f+\u202fwell\u2011targeted\u201d formula |\n|--------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Actors** | \u2022 United Nations (Resolution\u202f418\u202f/\u202f1977 \u2013 mandatory arms embargo).<br>\u2022 United States, European Community, Canada, Australia, Japan, and many African, Latin\u2011American and Asian states imposed **additional trade, investment and financial bans**.<br>\u2022 A broad coalition of **civil\u2011society movements** (e.g., the U.S. divest\u2011ment campaign, the anti\u2011apartheid movement in the UK). | **Multilateral** \u2013 >\u202f80\u202fcountries participated, covering the major sources of South\u2011Africa\u2019s export earnings (oil, machinery, arms, financing). The sanctions were **co\u2011ordinated** through the UN and through bilateral \u201ccomprehensive sanctions\u201d regimes, limiting loopholes. |\n| **Targeting** | \u2022 **Sector\u2011specific:** an arms embargo, a ban on mining equipment, a \u201coil\u2011embargo\u201d (the U.S. and EU cut off crude imports), and a prohibition on financing South\u2011African banks.<br>\u2022 **Elite\u2011focused:** asset freezes and travel bans on senior apartheid officials; a massive **divest\u2011ment** drive that hit the personal wealth of the white business elite. | **Well\u2011targeted** \u2013 the measures hit the *economic pillars* that sustained the regime (mining, finance, oil) while sparing basic humanitarian goods. By freezing the assets of top officials, the sanctions created \u201cpain points\u201d inside the ruling coalition. |\n| **Demand & Exit Strategy** | The **clear, limited demand** was: \u201cEnd the system of racial segregation and hold free elections.\u201d The sanctions were presented as a *temporary* measure that would be lifted once those conditions were met. | A **clear diplomatic pathway** gave the regime a calculable payoff for compliance. |\n| **Outcome** | By 1990, the South\u2011African government began dismantling apartheid legislation, released Nelson Mandela, and held its first multiracial elections in 1994. Most scholars credit the sanctions as a **major catalyst** (see Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f2007; Carter\u202f2018). | The campaign\u2019s success rate (policy change) is estimated at **\u2248\u202f45\u201350\u202f%** for this case\u2014well above the average for coercive sanctions. |\n\n### What the literature highlights as the decisive factors\n\n| Factor | Evidence |\n|--------|----------|\n| **Broad participation** \u2013 \u201cThe more states that join, the higher the economic cost to the target and the lower the chance of evasion\u201d (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2007, p.\u202f112). | |\n| **Targeting of regime\u2019s revenue sources** \u2013 \u201cOil, arms, and finance are the \u201clever points\u201d most often associated with success\u201d (Peksen\u202f2019). | |\n| **Clear, limited political objective** \u2013 \u201cWhen the demand is specific, the target can calculate the cost\u2011benefit of compliance\u201d (Drezner\u202f2011). | |\n| **Exit clause** \u2013 \u201cSanctions that are framed as reversible increase the likelihood of a negotiated settlement\u201d (Portela\u202f2020). | |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The overlapping regimes reduced \u201csanctions\u2011shopping\u201d and made evasion costly. |\n| **Targeting strategy** | \u2022 **Sector\u2011specific bans** on crude oil exports, petroleum products, and insurance/shipping services for oil tankers.<br>\u2022 **Financial\u2011sector freezes** on Iranian banks (e.g., Bank Melli, Bank Saderat) and on the **Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)**\u2011linked entities.<br>\u2022 **Elite\u2011targeted asset freezes and travel bans** on senior IRGC commanders, top Revolutionary Guard officials, and key members of the nuclear\u2011program leadership.<br>\u2022 **Secondary sanctions** that threatened third\u2011party companies with loss of access to the U.S. financial system if they helped Iran evade the primary measures. | **Well\u2011targeted** \u2013 the sanctions hit the *core revenue streams* (oil) and the *financial infrastructure* that enabled procurement of nuclear\u2011related technology, while sparing humanitarian goods (food, medicine). By freezing the assets of senior IRGC figures, the pressure was placed directly on the decision\u2011makers most responsible for the nuclear programme. |\n| **Clear demand & exit clause** | \u2022 **Demand:** Iran must **reduce its uranium enrichment capacity** (\u2264\u202f3.67\u202f% U\u2011235), **limit its stockpile** to 300\u202fkg of low\u2011enriched uranium, and **allow IAEA inspections** of all nuclear facilities.<br>\u2022 **Exit path:** **All UN, EU, and U.S. sanctions would be lifted** once the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified full compliance (the \u201csnap\u2011back\u201d provision allowed re\u2011imposition if Iran violated the deal). | **Explicit, limited objective** \u2013 the target was a *specific technical behaviour* (enrichment levels), not a broad political change. The **\u201clift\u2011when\u2011compliant\u201d** language gave Iran a calculable payoff: the sooner it met the limits, the faster its oil exports and financial links could resume. |\n| **Outcome** | \u2022 By **January\u202f2016**, Iran had **shut down its most advanced centrifuge cascade**, **reduced its enrichment level to 3.67\u202f%**, and **cut its stockpile to the agreed 300\u202fkg**.<br>\u2022 **UN\u2011wide sanctions were lifted** in early 2016, and Iran\u2019s oil exports jumped from ~\u202f0.5\u202fmillion bbl/month (pre\u2011JCPOA) to **\u2248\u202f2.5\u202fmillion bbl/month** by 2018.<br>\u2022 The IAEA repeatedly **verified Iran\u2019s compliance** until the United States withdrew in 2018 and re\u2011imposed secondary sanctions. | The *initial* period (2015\u20112018) is",
