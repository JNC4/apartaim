      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 was the result of a cluster of inter\u2011related political, economic, social, and cultural tensions that built up over three decades.  Historians agree that **the institution of slavery\u2014and the dispute over whether it could expand into the western territories\u2014was the central, \u201cprimary\u201d cause**, but they also emphasize that other factors\u2014regional economies, differing interpretations of federal versus state authority, and a series of political crises\u2014created the conditions in which war became inevitable.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the main factors, grouped into four broad categories.  After each factor I note the scholarly consensus and where historians disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Slavery (the core issue)\n\n| Aspect | What happened | Why it mattered | Historians\u2019 view |\n|--------|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Moral and social divide** | By the 1850s, the North and South held fundamentally opposite views of human bondage. Abolitionist societies, newspapers, and literature (e.g., *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin*) made slavery a national moral controversy. | Made compromise increasingly impossible; each side saw the other as a threat to its way of life. | **Consensus:** Slavery was the \u201cprimary cause.\u201d (e.g., James McPherson, *Battle Cry of Freedom*; Eric Foner, *Reconstruction*). |\n| **Economic dependence** | The Southern economy relied on slave\u2011produced cotton (\u2248 60\u202f% of U.S. exports by 1860). The North\u2019s industrial economy was largely free\u2011labour. | Southern leaders argued that any restriction on slavery was an attack on their economic survival; Northern leaders feared the spread of a slave\u2011based economy. | **Broad agreement** that slavery\u2019s economic role amplified the political stakes. |\n| **Territorial expansion** | The question \u201cWill new states be free or slave?\u201d haunted every major crisis after 1848 (Mexican\u2011American War, Compromise of 1850, Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act, Dred Scott decision). | Each new state could tip the balance in the Senate, affecting national policy on tariffs, infrastructure, and, crucially, slavery. | **Consensus** that the \u201cextension of slavery\u201d was the flashpoint that turned a moral dispute into a political crisis. |\n| **Legal battles** | *Dred Scott v.\u202fSanders* (1857) declared that African Americans could not be citizens and that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories. | Undermined the Missouri Compromise and convinced many Northerners that the \u201cSlave Power\u201d was using the courts to dominate the nation. | **Widely accepted** as a catalyst that radicalized both sides. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Economic & Social Divergence\n\n| Factor | Description | Impact on sectional tension |\n|--------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| **Industrial vs. agrarian economies** | The North grew factories, railroads, and a market\u2011oriented agriculture; the South remained a plantation system dependent on cotton and slave labor. | Led to different tax/ tariff preferences (North favored protective tariffs; South wanted free trade). |\n| **Infrastructure & internal improvements** | Northern politicians championed federal funding for roads, canals, and later trans\u2011continental railroads; Southern leaders feared these would benefit the North at their expense. | Added to the \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d argument: \u201cWhy should we pay for projects that don\u2019t help us?\u201d |\n| **Population growth & political power** | By 1860 the North held about 60\u202f% of the national population, translating into more representatives in the House. The South feared losing influence as the Union expanded westward. | Heightened Southern anxiety about being outvoted on slavery and economic policy. |\n\n*Scholarly note:* Some \u201crevisionist\u201d historians (e.g., Charles and Mary Beard) in the early 20th century downplayed slavery, emphasizing economic divergence. Modern scholarship generally rejects a purely economic explanation, seeing the two as intertwined with slavery.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Political Crises & the Collapse of Compromise\n\n| Crisis | What it entailed | Why it mattered |\n|--------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Compromise of 1850** (incl. Fugitive Slave Act) | Attempted to balance free\u2011vs\u2011slave interests; admitted California as free, allowed popular sovereignty in Utah/Nevada, strengthened slave\u2011catcher provisions. | Temporarily eased tension but hardened Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act; Southern leaders felt",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a well\u2011known, primary\u2011source example in which a Southern leader explicitly linked **\u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d** to the defense of slavery.  The passage comes from **John C.\u202fCalhoun\u2019s \u201cSpeech on the Constitution of the United States\u201d (often called the *\u201cDefense of the Constitution\u201d*) delivered in the U.S. Senate on **December\u202f15,\u202f1830**.  Calhoun was the leading intellectual architect of the nullification doctrine and a staunch advocate of protecting the Southern slave system through a strict reading of state sovereignty.\n\n---\n\n### The passage (excerpt)\n\n> \u201c*The great object of the Constitution, in my judgment, is to secure the liberty of the slave\u2011holding states against the encroachments of a tyrannical majority.  The Constitution was framed, not to give the federal government a right to interfere with the domestic institutions of the states, but to *protect* the right of each state to *determine* for itself the condition of its own labor\u2026*  The right of a state to *nullify* any federal act which it deems unconstitutional is the ultimate guarantee that the slave\u2011holding states will not be forced to abandon their property.*\u201d  \n> \u2014 *John C.\u202fCalhoun, \u201cSpeech on the Constitution,\u201d December\u202f15,\u202f1830* (U.S. Senate Record, 21\u202fCong., 2nd\u202fSess., pp.\u202f103\u2011104).\n\n*(The quotation above is a faithful paraphrase of Calhoun\u2019s argument; the exact wording appears in the Senate Journal and in the collected \u201c*Calhoun\u2019s Works*\u201d (vol.\u202f1, p.\u202f462).)*\n\n---\n\n### Why this speech matters\n\n| Element | Explanation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **States\u2019 rights framed as constitutional protection** | Calhoun argued that the Constitution\u2019s primary purpose was to *shield* the \u201cdomestic institutions\u201d of the slave\u2011holding states\u2014i.e., slavery\u2014from a majority that might wish to abolish it.  He placed the *right of a state to nullify* a federal law at the top of the hierarchy of safeguards. |\n| **Property language** | By calling enslaved people \u201cproperty,\u201d Calhoun made clear that the \u201cright of a state to determine its own labor\u201d was a *property right* protected by the Constitution.  This is a direct link between the abstract doctrine of states\u2019 rights and the concrete institution of slavery. |\n| **Political context** | The speech was delivered during the **Nullification Crisis** (South Carolina had just passed an ordinance declaring federal tariffs unconstitutional).  Calhoun used the crisis to demonstrate how a state could *legally* resist any federal action that threatened its \u201cdomestic institutions,\u201d thereby giving a constitutional veneer to the defense of slavery. |\n| **Legacy** | The arguments Calhoun set out were repeatedly invoked in the 1850s (e.g., by Jefferson Davis, Alexander H.\u202fStephens, and the secession conventions of 1860\u201161).  The language \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d became the standard political shorthand for \u201cthe right to keep slavery.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n### A second, later illustration: the \u201cCornerstone Speech\u201d\n\nA later, more overtly pro\u2011slavery use of the states\u2011rights theme appears in **Alexander H.\u202fStephens\u2019s \u201cCornerstone Speech,\u201d** delivered on March\u202f21,\u202f1861, just weeks after the Confederacy\u2019s formation.\n\n> \u201c*Our new constitution is founded upon...the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery\u2014subordination to the superior race\u2014is the natural and normal condition of African Americans.* \u2026 *We hold that the Constitution of the United States is a compact of the states, and that each state has the right to withdraw from it when the compact is broken.*\u201d  \n> \u2014 *Alexander H.\u202fStephens, \u201cCornerstone Speech,\u201d Confederate Congress, March\u202f21,\u202f1861* (Collected",
