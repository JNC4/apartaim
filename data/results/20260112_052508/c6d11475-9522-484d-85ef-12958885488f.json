      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to reshape the demand for labor in the signatory economies.  In the aggregate they can raise total employment and wages in the long run, but the gains are unevenly distributed across sectors, skill groups, regions and time\u2011frames.  Whether a particular worker ends up better\u2011off, worse\u2011off, or unchanged depends on:\n\n| Factor | How it pushes the outcome one way or the other |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Industry exposure** | Jobs in export\u2011oriented, \u201ccomparatively advantaged\u201d sectors (e.g., high\u2011tech, capital\u2011intensive manufacturing, services) usually see higher demand, higher wages, and more skill\u2011upgrade opportunities.  Jobs in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill, labor\u2011intensive sectors (e.g., textiles, basic agriculture) often face job losses or wage pressure. |\n| **Skill level** | High\u2011skill, college\u2011educated workers tend to benefit from the shift toward higher\u2011value production; low\u2011skill workers are more vulnerable to displacement. |\n| **Geography** | Regions that host the expanding industries (ports, logistics hubs, high\u2011tech clusters) see net gains; regions dependent on declining sectors can suffer prolonged unemployment. |\n| **Labor\u2011market institutions** | Strong unemployment insurance, active\u2011labour\u2011market policies, and enforceable labor\u2011standards clauses can cushion adjustment costs and help workers move into growing sectors. |\n| **Implementation and enforcement** | When FTAs include robust labor\u2011rights provisions and mechanisms for monitoring, they can raise workplace standards; weak enforcement can leave workers exposed to a \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d. |\n| **Macroeconomic context** | A flexible exchange\u2011rate regime, sound fiscal policy, and low inflation tend to amplify the positive employment effects of trade openness.  Conversely, a rigid macro\u2011environment can magnify short\u2011run dislocation. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that breaks down the principal channels through which FTAs affect workers, the empirical findings that support each channel, and the points that remain contested in the academic and policy literature.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical channels\n\n| Channel | Expected impact on workers | Core theory |\n|---------|---------------------------|-------------|\n| **Export\u2011expansion effect** | \u2191 demand for labor in sectors that gain market access \u2192 higher wages & employment in those sectors. | Ricardian/Heckscher\u2011Ohlin models; \u201cspecific\u2011factor\u201d models. |\n| **Import\u2011competition effect** | \u2193 demand for labor in sectors that lose market share \u2192 job loss or wage decline. | Same models; Stolper\u2011Samuelson theorem predicts that the factor used intensively in import\u2011competing goods loses real income. |\n| **Productivity spill\u2011overs** | \u2191 overall productivity \u2192 higher real wages even for workers who do not change jobs (through \u201clearning\u2011by\u2011doing\u201d, technology diffusion). | New\u2011trade theory (Krugman 1991) and endogenous growth models. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** | Convergence of wages across partner countries, potentially raising wages in low\u2011wage economies and modestly lowering them in high\u2011wage economies. | Heckscher\u2011Ohlin factor\u2011price equalisation theorem. |\n| **Adjustment costs** | Short\u2011run unemployment, skill mismatch, regional dislocation. | Search\u2011and\u2011matching models; \u201cadjustment cost\u201d literature. |\n| **Labor\u2011standards clauses** | May raise wages and safety standards if enforced; may also increase compliance costs for firms, possibly affecting hiring. | Institutional economics; \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d vs \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011top\u201d debate. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical evidence tells us\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate employment and wage trends\n\n| Study | Region / FTA | Methodology | Main findings |\n|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)** \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d | U.S. (1990\u20112010) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences using local exposure to import competition from China. | Counties with higher exposure lost ~1.5% of manufacturing jobs per year; average wages fell by ~2\u20113% relative to less\u2011exposed counties.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is one of the most\u2011cited \u201csuccess\u2011story\u201d cases in the trade\u2011policy literature: **the North\u2011American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and highly\u2011skilled, export\u2011oriented workers in the United States\u2019 \u201chigh\u2011technology manufacturing\u201d cluster, especially in the \u201cSouth\u2011East\u201d (North\u2011Carolina, South\u2011Carolina, Georgia, and parts of Tennessee).**  \n\nThe example illustrates how a free\u2011trade agreement can generate a clear, measurable gain for a well\u2011defined group of workers while the broader picture remains mixed.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The context\n\n| Element | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **FTA** | NAFTA (1994\u20112020, succeeded by the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement, USMCA). It eliminated tariffs on virtually all goods traded among the United States, Canada, and Mexico and created \u201crules\u2011of\u2011origin\u201d that encouraged firms to locate production stages where they could be most efficient. |\n| **Industry** | Advanced\u2011manufacturing subsectors that export a large share of their output to Canada and Mexico: aerospace components, medical\u2011device parts, computer\u2011hardware, and precision metal\u2011fabrication. |\n| **Worker group** | *College\u2011educated, technical\u2011skill workers* (engineers, CNC\u2011machinists, quality\u2011control specialists, R&D staff). In 1995 the median age of these workers was ~35, and most held at least an associate\u2011degree or technical certification. |\n| **Geographic focus** | The \u201cResearch Triangle\u201d (Raleigh\u2011Durham\u2011Chapel Hill) and the \u201cUpstate\u201d of South Carolina, plus a growing cluster in Atlanta. These regions already had a modest base of universities and community colleges, but they were not yet major export hubs. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.  How NAFTA\u2019s \u201crules\u2011of\u2011origin\u201d (ROO) worked in practice  \n\n### 1.1  What \u201crules\u2011of\u2011origin\u201d are  \n\n* **Definition** \u2013 ROO are the legal criteria that determine whether a good is considered \u201coriginating\u201d in a partner country and therefore eligible for preferential (tariff\u2011free) treatment under the agreement.  \n* **Why they matter** \u2013 If a good does **not** meet the ROO, it is subject to the Most\u2011Favoured\u2011Nation (MFN) tariff that each partner imposes on non\u2011partner imports. The extra cost can be large enough to change a firm\u2019s production\u2011location decision.  \n\n### 1.2  NAFTA\u2019s specific ROO structure  \n\n| Element | NAFTA provision | Practical effect |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Tariff\u2011elimination threshold** | A product can enter duty\u2011free if **\u2264\u202f15\u202f%** of its value (or \u2264\u202f10\u202f% for certain automotive parts) is made up of non\u2011NAFTA inputs. | Firms can import a modest share of \u201chigh\u2011cost\u201d inputs (e.g., specialized electronic components) without losing tariff\u2011free status. |\n| **Regional\u2011value\u2011content (RVC) requirement** | For most goods, the **value added** that occurs in the three NAFTA countries must be at least **50\u202f%** of the final product\u2019s value (again, 62.5\u202f% for autos). | To meet the RVC, firms must locate enough **value\u2011adding activities**\u2014design, engineering, assembly, testing\u2014within the bloc. |\n| **Specific\u2011process rules** | Certain products (e.g., \u201cknitted apparel\u201d or \u201cautomotive parts\u201d) must be **substantially transformed** in a NAFTA country (a change in tariff classification, a new HS chapter, etc.). | Encourages firms to move a **processing step** (e.g., stamping, coating, final assembly) across the border rather than merely shipping raw material. |\n| **Documentation** | \u201cCertificate of Origin\u201d must be completed by the exporter, attesting that the RVC or process rule is satisfied; customs can audit. | Creates a **paper\u2011trail** that makes it easy for customs officials to verify compliance, reducing the risk of penalty. |\n| **Self\u2011verification & audit regime** | Companies may self\u2011certify, but customs can request supporting records; penalties for false statements can be up to **$500,000** per violation. | Provides a **deterrent** against \u201ctariff\u2011shopping\u201d and encourages firms to design their supply chains to be demonstrably compliant. |\n\n### 1.3  Why the ROO nudged firms to \u201cslice\u201d production across the border  \n\n| Step in the supply\u2011chain decision | How the ROO altered the cost\u2011benefit calculation |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Identify low\u2011cost labor** | Mexico\u2019s hourly wage for assembly\u2011line workers was roughly **1/4\u20131/3** of the U.S. rate in the 1990s. Moving the *labor\u2011intensive* step (e.g., final assembly, sub\u2011assembly) to Mexico reduced direct labor cost dramatically. |\n| **Check RVC impact** | If a firm moved **only** the low\u2011cost step, the value added in Mexico might still be **\u2264\u202f15\u202f%** of the total product value, satisfying the tariff\u2011free test. The firm could keep the *high\u2011skill* design and engineering steps in the U.S. (which add the bulk of the product\u2019s value) and still qualify for duty\u2011free export. |\n| **Add a \u201cvalue\u2011adding\u201d process** | To meet the 50\u202f% RVC for more complex goods, firms sometimes added a *minor* but \u201cvalue\u2011adding\u201d operation in Mexico\u2014e.g., **precision CNC machining**, **surface\u2011treatment**, or **final testing**. These activities are not as skill\u2011intensive as design but still count as value added, pushing the RVC above the threshold. |\n| **Leverage specific\u2011process rules** | For automotive parts, the \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d rule required a **new HS chapter** (e.g., from raw steel to a finished suspension component). Companies responded by locating the *press\u2011forming* operation in Mexican plants, which satisfied the transformation test while still using U.S.\u2011designed CAD files and engineering support. |\n| **Minimize compliance cost** | The self\u2011certification system meant a firm could **internalize",
