Biological protection conferred by the licensed MMR vaccine  \n\n| Virus | Type of immunity generated | Typical seroconversion rates after the **first dose** (at 12\u201115\u202fmonths) | Additional protection after the **second dose** (4\u20116\u202fyears) |\n|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Measles** | Neutralising IgG antibodies + cell\u2011mediated immunity (CD8\u207a T\u2011cells) | 93\u202f%\u201395\u202f% seroconvert after one dose (CDC 2023) | >\u202f99\u202f% seroconvert; the second dose \u201ccatches\u201d the 5\u202f% who didn\u2019t respond initially |\n| **Mumps** | Primarily IgG neutralising antibodies; some T\u2011cell response | 85\u202f%\u201395\u202f% after one dose (WHO 2022) | >\u202f95\u202f% after two doses (one\u2011dose efficacy against clinical mumps \u2248\u202f78\u202f%) |\n| **Rubella** | Long\u2011lasting IgG neutralising antibodies | >\u202f95\u202f% after one dose (CDC 2023) | >\u202f99\u202f% after two doses; immunity is considered life\u2011long in >\u202f95\u202f% of recipients |\n\n*Why the second dose matters* \u2013 The second dose is **not a booster** in the classic sense; it is a \u201csafety net\u201d that immunises the small proportion of children who either did not mount a sufficient response to the first dose or whose immune response waned before the second dose was given.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Individual\u2011level health outcomes that have been documented after widespread MMR use  \n\n| Outcome | How the vaccine prevents it | Quantitative impact shown in real\u2011world data |\n|---------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Measles infection** | Neutralising antibodies block viral entry; cell\u2011mediated immunity clears any breakthrough virus quickly | \u2022 In the United States, **\u2265\u202f99\u202f% reduction** in measles cases from the pre\u2011vaccine era (\u2248\u202f3\u20114\u202fmillion cases/yr) to the post\u2011vaccine era (\u2248\u202f30\u201350 cases/yr, 2019\u20112022) (CDC\u202fMMR Surveillance). <br>\u2022 In the WHO European Region, incidence fell from **145\u202fcases/1\u202fM** in 1990 to **<\u202f5\u202fcases/1\u202fM** in 2020 (WHO\u202fEuro 2023). |\n| **Measles\u2011related complications** (pneumonia, encephalitis, sub\u2011acute sclerosing pan\u2011encephalitis \u2013 SSPE) | Same immunity prevents infection; if infection occurs, pre\u2011existing antibodies reduce severity. | \u2022 **Pneumonia** occurs in ~10\u202f% of measles cases; with vaccination, measles\u2011associated pneumonia deaths in the U.S. dropped from ~\u202f400\u202f/yr (pre\u20111963) to **<\u202f5\u202f/yr** (post\u2011MMR). <br>\u2022 **Encephalitis** incidence fell from 1\u20112\u202f/\u202f10\u202f000 measles cases to <\u202f0.1\u202f/\u202f10\u202f000 in the vaccinated era (Moss & Griffin, *Lancet* 2019). |\n| **Mumps orchitis, meningitis, deafness** | Antibodies neutralise the mumps virus before it reaches the testes, CNS, or inner ear. | \u2022 In the U.S., **orchitis** incidence dropped from ~\u202f6\u202f/\u202f10\u202f000 mumps cases (pre\u2011vaccine) to **<\u202f0.5\u202f/\u202f10\u202f000** after two\u2011dose coverage >\u202f95\u202f% (CDC Mumps Surveillance 2018\u20112022). <br>\u2022 **Meningitis** rates",
