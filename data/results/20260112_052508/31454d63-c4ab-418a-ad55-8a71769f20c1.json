      "unknown_model_response": "Pasteurization is a heat\u2011treatment process that is designed to destroy the vast majority of disease\u2011causing microorganisms in milk. By heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time (for example, 72\u202f\u00b0C/161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fseconds in the \u201chigh\u2011temperature short\u2011time\u201d method), the process kills most pathogenic bacteria such as *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, and *Campylobacter*.\n\nHowever, pasteurization does **not** sterilize milk; it does not eliminate *all* bacteria. Some heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., certain *Bacillus* species) can survive the treatment, and post\u2011process contamination can re\u2011introduce microbes if the milk is not handled, stored, or packaged under strict hygienic conditions. Consequently, while the risk of food\u2011borne illness is dramatically reduced\u2014by several orders of magnitude\u2014compared with raw milk, it is not zero.\n\nIn practice, the residual risk after proper pasteurization and good manufacturing practices is extremely low, and the process is widely regarded as an effective public\u2011health measure to protect consumers from serious milk\u2011borne infections.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below are some of the most common food\u2011borne illnesses that have been linked to the consumption of raw (unpasteurised) milk, along with a brief explanation of how pasteurisation dramatically reduces the risk of each.\n\n### 1. **Salmonella**\n- **How it shows up:** Diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, fever, sometimes vomiting. Symptoms usually appear 6\u201172\u202fhours after ingestion and can last 4\u20117\u202fdays.\n- **Why raw milk matters:** *Salmonella* can be present in the udder or on the farm environment and survive in raw milk because the bacteria are not killed by the low temperatures of normal refrigeration.\n- **Pasteurisation effect:** Heating milk to 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds (HTST) kills >99.999% of *Salmonella* cells. Outbreak investigations consistently show that cases drop to near\u2011zero when pasteurised milk is the only product sold.\n\n### 2. **Escherichia coli O157:H7**\n- **How it shows up:** Severe abdominal cramps, watery then bloody diarrhoea, and in some cases haemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (a serious kidney condition). Incubation is typically 3\u20114\u202fdays.\n- **Why raw milk matters:** Cattle can shed this strain in their faeces, contaminating the udder or milking equipment. Because the bacteria produce a heat\u2011stable toxin, the toxin itself can persist, but the live bacteria are destroyed by proper pasteurisation.\n- **Pasteurisation effect:** The same HTST regimen eliminates virtually all viable *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 cells. Outbreaks linked to raw milk are far more common than those linked to pasteurised milk.\n\n### 3. **Listeria monocytogenes**\n- **How it shows up:** Flu\u2011like symptoms, fever, muscle aches; in high\u2011risk groups (pregnant people, elderly, immunocompromised) it can cause meningitis, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Incubation can be up to several weeks.\n- **Why raw milk matters:** *Listeria* can grow at refrigeration temperatures, so even a small initial load can increase during storage of raw milk.\n- **Pasteurisation effect:** Heat treatment kills *Listeria* cells outright. Post\u2011pasteurisation contamination is rare when good manufacturing practices are followed, making the risk negligible.\n\n### 4. **Campylobacter jejuni**\n- **How it shows up:** Watery or bloody diarrhoea,",
