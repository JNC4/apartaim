      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** \u2013 the large\u2011scale purchase of government bonds (and sometimes other securities) by a central bank \u2013 works through several transmission channels.  Those channels affect groups in the economy in different ways, producing a mixed distributional picture.  Below is a synthesis of the main mechanisms, the empirical evidence that has been gathered (mostly from the United States, the Euro\u2011area, the United Kingdom and Japan), and the points where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels\n\n| Channel | What the central bank does | Primary macro\u2011effect | Who is directly affected |\n|---------|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Interest\u2011rate channel** | Purchases long\u2011dated Treasuries or sovereign bonds, pushing yields down. | Reduces the cost of borrowing for households and firms. | Borrowers (mortgages, business loans, student loans). |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing channel** | Buyers (the central bank) replace safe bonds with cash, which is taken up by private investors who shift into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate). | Raises prices of those assets and lowers their yields. | Owners of financial assets (stockholders, bond\u2011holders, REIT investors). |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Lower domestic yields make the currency less attractive, leading to depreciation. | Improves export competitiveness but raises import prices. | Export\u2011oriented firms and workers; import\u2011dependent consumers (especially low\u2011income households). |\n| **Credit\u2011supply channel** | By improving banks\u2019 balance sheets (they sell bonds to the central bank) and by lowering funding costs, banks are more willing to lend. | Expands credit to households and firms. | Small\u2011business owners and borrowers who are credit\u2011constrained; also savers who rely on bank deposits. |\n| **Inflation\u2011expectations channel** | Signalling that the central bank will keep policy accommodative until inflation rises. | May raise expected inflation, influencing wage\u2011setting and price\u2011setting. | Workers negotiating wages; holders of fixed\u2011rate assets (pensions, bonds). |\n| **Fiscal\u2011stimulus (indirect) channel** | QE lowers government borrowing costs, making fiscal expansion cheaper. | Allows higher government spending or tax cuts without raising debt service. | Broad public, but especially low\u2011income groups if fiscal spending is targeted. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Distributional outcomes that have been documented\n\n### A. **Borrowers vs. Savers**\n\n| Evidence | Findings | How it translates to groups |\n|----------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| **U.S. Federal Reserve (2008\u20112014)** \u2013 Gagnon, Raskin & Remache (2015) | Mortgage rates fell ~1\u20111.5\u202fpercentage points; auto\u2011loan rates fell ~0.3\u202fpp. | Home\u2011buyers (especially first\u2011time buyers) and car\u2011buyers benefited; savers on low\u2011yield deposits saw real returns decline. |\n| **Euro\u2011area (ECB QE 2015\u20112018)** \u2013 D\u2019Amico, et\u202fal. (2020) | Household borrowing grew modestly; savings rates fell slightly. | Households with existing debt (often middle\u2011income) enjoyed cheaper financing, while retirees relying on interest income saw lower yields. |\n| **Japan (BoJ QE 2013\u20112020)** \u2013 Kuttner & Posen (2021) | Long\u2011term rates near zero; corporate borrowing surged, but household saving remained high because of cultural preferences. | Corporate borrowers benefited; household savers experienced negligible income effects. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** QE is generally **progressive for borrowers** (lower mortgage, business\u2011loan, student\u2011loan costs) and **regressive for pure savers** who depend on interest income, especially retirees with fixed\u2011income portfolios.\n\n### B. **Owners of Financial Assets (stocks, bonds, real estate)**\n\n| Evidence | Findings | Who gains |\n|----------|----------|-----------|\n| **U.S. \u201cstock\u2011price channel\u201d** \u2013 Krishnamurthy & Vissing\u2011Miller (2011) | QE1\u20113 raised the S&P\u202f500 by roughly",

The market therefore **depreciates** the domestic currency relative to foreign currencies. |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3 | A weaker currency raises the price of imported goods and services (the \u201cexchange\u2011rate pass\u2011through\u201d). | The price of a foreign\u2011produced good measured in domestic currency rises roughly in proportion to the depreciation, *but* the exact magnitude depends on three factors: <br>\u2022 **Openness** (share of imports in consumption) <br>\u2022 **Pricing behaviour of exporters** (do they keep prices in foreign currency?) <br>\u2022 **Monetary\u2011policy credibility** (inflation expectations). | Higher import prices show up in the consumer\u2011price index (CPI) for items such as food, gasoline, clothing, home appliances, and for many services (e.g., travel, streaming). |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3 | A weaker currency also makes domestically\u2011produced goods cheaper for foreign buyers. | Export\u2011oriented firms see **higher foreign demand** and may expand production or hire more workers. | For workers in export\u2011intensive sectors (e.g., manufacturing, agriculture, tourism) wages can rise or jobs can be created. The effect is strongest in regions where those sectors are a large share of employment. |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3 | The net effect on the household depends on the **balance** between the cost of pricier imports and the income gain from a stronger export sector. | If the **import\u2011price pass\u2011through** is high and the household\u2019s consumption basket is import\u2011heavy, the net impact is **negative**.
