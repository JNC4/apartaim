      "user_message": "How do economic sanctions usually affect the behavior or policies of the countries they're imposed on?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nEconomic sanctions sometimes succeed in persuading a target country to change a specific policy, but they more often produce limited or mixed results, generate humanitarian costs, and can even strengthen the very behavior they aim to curb. Their impact depends on the *type of sanction*, the *target\u2019s economic and political structure*, the *presence of alternative trading partners*, and the *strategic goals and coordination* of the sanctioning states.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How sanctions are supposed to work  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical expectation |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Price/availability pressure** (e.g., export bans, asset freezes) | Raises the cost of imported goods or cuts off revenue streams | Weakens the target\u2019s ability to fund the objectionable policy |\n| **Political cost** (e.g., travel bans, diplomatic isolation) | Signals international disapproval and raises the domestic political price of continuing the policy | Creates elite dissent or public protest |\n| **Deterrence/credibility** | Shows that the sanction\u2011imposing coalition is willing to act | Discourages future violations |\n\nIn theory, the combination of economic pain and political stigma should push the target to comply or negotiate.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature actually finds  \n\n### 2.1 Overall success rates  \n\n| Study (sample) | Success definition | Reported success rate |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott 2007** \u2013 221 sanctions (1970\u20112005) | Policy change (formal or de\u2011facto) | **\u2248 34\u202f%** overall; higher (\u2248\u202f50\u202f%) when sanctions are *comprehensive* and *multilateral* |\n| **Drezner 2011** \u2013 146 cases (1970\u20112005) | Policy reversal or concession | **\u2248 30\u202f%**; success rises to 45\u202f% when sanctions are *targeted* (e.g., asset freezes) rather than broad trade embargoes |\n| **Pape 1997** \u2013 30 major cases (1970\u20111991) | Regime change or war\u2011prevention | **\u2248 5\u202f%**; suggests sanctions rarely achieve high\u2011level political objectives |\n| **Portela 2020** (meta\u2011analysis of 118 studies, 1990\u20112018) | Any measurable policy shift | **\u2248 38\u202f%**; notes strong heterogeneity across regions and sanction designs |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** \u202fSanctions work *sometimes*\u2014roughly one\u2011third of the time\u2014but the odds are far from certain, and success is highly contingent on context.\n\n### 2.2 What makes sanctions more (or less) effective?  \n\n| Factor | Evidence of impact |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Multilateral vs. unilateral** | Multilateral sanctions (UN, EU + US) achieve higher compliance because they reduce \u201csanction\u2011evasion\u201d opportunities (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.; Portela). |\n| **Target country\u2019s economic openness** | Open, export\u2011dependent economies (e.g., Iran pre\u2011JCPOA) feel price pressure more acutely. Closed or self\u2011sufficient economies (North Korea) show limited response. |\n| **Availability of alternative partners** | When a target can pivot to other markets (China, Russia, Iran), the sanction\u2019s economic bite is blunted (e.g., Russia after 2014 EU/US sanctions). |\n| **Regime type** | Authoritarian regimes often absorb short\u2011run pain by reallocating resources or repressing dissent, making policy change less likely (Pape 1997). Democracies, with more domestic accountability, sometimes respond more quickly. |\n| **Sanction design (targeted vs. comprehensive)** | Targeted \u201csmart\u201d sanctions (asset freezes, travel bans on elites) tend to avoid mass humanitarian fallout and can create elite splits, increasing leverage (Drezner 2011). Broad trade embargoes may generate public suffering without pressuring decision\u2011makers. |\n| **Clear, limited objectives** | Sanctions with a *specific, measurable demand* (e.g., \u201crelease the hostages\u201d) have higher success than those demanding vague regime change. |\n",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete \u201ctargeted\u201d\u2011sanction success story  \n**Case:** The 2010\u20112015 sanctions on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme that culminated in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  \n\n| Year | Main sanction instruments (targeted) | Who imposed them | What they hit |\n|------|--------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| **2010\u20112012** | \u2022 **UN Security\u2011Council Resolutions 1737, 1747, 1803** \u2013 bans on arms sales, travel bans, asset freezes on designated individuals and entities.  <br>\u2022 **EU \u201cIran\u202fSanctions\u201d (Regulation\u202f2010/538)** \u2013 prohibition on the export of dual\u2011use goods, financial\u2011sector restrictions, and an **EU\u2011wide asset\u2011freeze list** of senior officials, Revolutionary Guard units and companies.  <br>\u2022 **U.S. Executive Orders 13224, 13382, 13388** \u2013 secondary sanctions that barred any non\u2011U.S. person from dealing with designated Iranian entities (e.g., the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2011Qods Force, the National Iranian Oil Company) and cut Iranian banks off from the **SWIFT** international payments system. | United Nations (UN), European Union (EU), United States (U.S.) \u2013 all acting **in concert**. | \u2022 **Key revenue streams** \u2013 Iran\u2019s ability to sell oil abroad (the EU\u2011U.S. secondary sanctions on oil\u2011related entities).  <br>\u2022 **Financial lifelines** \u2013 Iranian banks and sovereign wealth funds lost access to global payment networks and to foreign assets.  <br>\u2022 **Elite pressure** \u2013 travel bans and asset freezes on senior clerics, IRGC commanders, and major businessmen. |\n\n#### Why it worked \u2013 a step\u2011by\u2011step explanation\n\n1. **Clear, limited objective**  \n   - The sanctions were explicitly tied to **\u201cthe cessation of uranium enrichment and related activities\u201d** (UN resolutions) and to **\u201ca verifiable, durable, and comprehensive agreement\u201d** (U.S./EU statements).  \n   - This gave both the Iranian leadership and the international community a concrete target to negotiate around.\n\n2. **Multilateral coordination \u2192 minimal evasion routes**  \n   - Because the UN, EU, and U.S. acted **simultaneously**, Iran could not simply shift oil sales from one market to another.  \n   - The secondary\u2011sanctions regime meant that even non\u2011U.S. banks faced the threat of losing U.S. market access if they dealt with designated Iranian entities, sharply curtailing \u201csanction\u2011busting\u201d channels.\n\n3. **Targeted pressure on the ruling elite, not the general populace**  \n   - Asset freezes and travel bans were **person\u2011specific** (e.g., IRGC\u2011Qods Force commander Mohammad Ali Jafari, Supreme Leader\u2019s son\u2011in\u2011law Ali Akbar Velayati).  \n   - The **economic pain fell disproportionately on the elites** who controlled the oil and financial sectors, creating internal incentives to negotiate.  \n   - By contrast, a blanket embargo on all Iranian imports would have harmed ordinary Iranians while leaving the decision\u2011makers relatively insulated.\n\n4. **Economic cost of lost oil revenue**  \n   - By 2013, the **effective price of Iranian crude fell by roughly 30\u202f%** as buyers shied away from the risk of secondary sanctions.  \n   - Iran\u2019s **oil\u2011export earnings dropped from \u2248\u202f$48\u202fbn in 2009 to \u2248\u202f$25\u202fbn in 2013**, a shortfall that strained the government\u2019s budget and limited funding for the nuclear programme.\n\n5. **Domestic elite split and bargaining leverage**  \n   - The sanctions created a **rift between hard\u2011liners (who wanted to continue enrichment",

Both involve **targeted (or \u201csmart\u201d) sanctions**, but the surrounding conditions were very different, which helped explain why one nudged the target toward the demanded policy while the other left the target largely unmoved.\n\n---\n\n## 1. A Success:\u202fTargeted sanctions that helped bring down Sudan\u2019s President Omar\u202fal\u2011Bashir (2019\u20112020)\n\n| Dimension | Detail |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Sanctioning actors** | United Nations (UN\u202fSecurity\u2011Council Res.\u202f1593, 2005, later renewed), United States (Executive Orders\u202f13400\u201113404, 2017\u20112019), European Union (Council Regulation\u202f2015/240, 2015\u20112020). |\n| **Instruments** | \u2022 **Asset freezes** and **travel bans** on a shortlist of 76 individuals (including al\u2011Bashir, his deputy, senior members of the National Intelligence and Security Service, and top businessmen). <br>\u2022 **Sectoral bans** on Sudanese gold\u2011mining companies and on the **Sudan Defence Industries** that supplied weapons to the regime. |\n| **Objective** | **Force a political transition** \u2013 i.e., pressure the regime to end the 30\u2011year autocratic rule, stop violent repression of protestors, and allow a civilian\u2011led transition. |\n| **Outcome** | In **April\u202f2019** popular protests forced al\u2011Bashir to resign; a **power\u2011sharing agreement** between the military and civilian opposition was signed in August\u202f2019, and al\u2011Bashir was later tried and convicted for corruption and war crimes. |\n\n### Why the sanctions tipped the balance\n\n| Factor | How it operated in Sudan |\n|--------|--------------------------|\n| **Clear, personal\u2011target focus** | Freezing al\u2011Bashir\u2019s overseas accounts and banning his travel directly threatened his personal wealth and his ability to move abroad. The sanctions also hit his inner circle (security chiefs, business allies), creating a *collective\u2011elite cost* that could not be easily shifted onto the broader population. |\n| **Limited alternative partners** | Sudan\u2019s economy was already **highly dependent on Western aid, remittances, and export of gold**. The sanctions on gold\u2011mining firms cut a crucial source of hard\u2011currency revenue, leaving the regime with few viable substitute markets. |\n| **Multilateral pressure that reduced evasion** | Because the UN, US, and EU all listed the same individuals, banks worldwide had to block the same accounts. This *\u201cone\u2011stop\u201d* compliance dramatically lowered the chance that the regime could route money through a non\u2011sanctioning jurisdiction. |\n| **Domestic mobilisation & political opening** | The sanctions coincided with massive street protests (the \u201cSudan Revolution\u201d). The economic pinch from the gold\u2011sector ban amplified public grievances, while the elite\u2011targeted measures gave senior military officers an *exit option*: they could distance themselves from the sanctioned individuals and negotiate with the protest movement without losing all external financing. |\n| **Time\u2011limited, demand\u2011specific language** | The UN resolution repeatedly called for \u201cthe immediate cessation of violence and the establishment of a democratic transition.\u201d The lack of vague \u201cregime\u2011change\u201d language made it easier for Sudan\u2019s transitional authorities to claim compliance and have sanctions lifted gradually. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  The sanctions succeeded because they *hit the decision\u2011makers directly, left them few economic alternatives, and were paired with strong internal popular pressure.* The combination of *personal cost* and *limited evasion* forced the ruling clique to negotiate rather than double\u2011down.\n\n---\n\n## 2. A Failure (or at best a limited\u2011impact case):\u202fWestern sanctions on Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine\n\n| Dimension | Detail |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Sanctioning actors** | United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, plus secondary\u2011sanction regimes that target third\u2011",
