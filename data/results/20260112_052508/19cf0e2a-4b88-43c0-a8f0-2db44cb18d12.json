The stated goal is to reduce the number of guns in circulation, especially those that might be used in crimes or suicides. | Some programs are paired with \u201camnesty\u201d provisions that protect participants from prosecution for illegal possession, while others require the gun to be legally owned. |\n| **Funding** | Usually municipal, state, or national government budgets; sometimes funded by NGOs, private foundations, or corporate sponsors. | In the United States, most buy\u2011backs are city\u2011level and rely on modest grants (often $100\u2013$300 per gun). In Australia, the 1996 national program was financed by a temporary levy on all taxpayers. |\n| **Incentive** | Cash (often $50\u2011$200 per firearm), gift cards, or vouchers for local businesses. | Some programs offer higher payments for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles, large\u2011capacity magazines), while others give a flat rate regardless of type. |\n| **Logistics** | \u2013 Announced publicly (media, flyers, community meetings).<br>\u2013 Designated collection sites (police stations, community centers, mobile trucks).<br>\u2013 Hours are usually limited to a few days or a weekend.<br>\u2013 Turned\u2011in firearms are recorded, rendered inoperable (e.g., shredding, melting), and disposed of. | Mobile \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events can reach neighborhoods with limited police presence. Some jurisdictions allow anonymous drop\u2011boxes that operate 24\u202fh. |\n| **Eligibility** | Most programs accept any firearm that the participant can legally possess; many also accept illegal or unregistered weapons under an amnesty clause. | In the U.S., a few states (e.g., Connecticut, Illinois) have \u201cmandatory surrender\u201d provisions tied to certain offenses, but true buy\u2011backs remain voluntary. |\n| **Follow\u2011up** | Data collection on the number, type, and condition of guns surrendered; sometimes surveys of participants about why they turned in guns. | Few programs systematically track the ultimate fate of the firearms beyond \u201cdestroyed.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n## What the research says about impact on gun\u2011related violence\n\n### 1.

The most often\u2011cited city\u2011level example: **New York City (2015\u20132016) \u201cBuy\u2011Back & Safe\u2011Storage\u201d pilot**\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Program** | A two\u2011month, city\u2011wide voluntary buy\u2011back that offered **US\u202f$150 cash per handgun** (plus a voucher for a lock\u2011box). The event was run by the NYPD in partnership with the city\u2019s Department of Finance and several community NGOs. |\n| **Scale** | **\u2248\u202f2,300 firearms** (\u2248\u202f1,900 handguns, 400 long guns) were turned in, representing about **0.2\u202f% of the estimated hand\u2011gun stock** in the city (\u2248\u202f1.1\u202fmillion). |\n| **Data source** | Police\u2011department incident data (NYPD\u2019s \u201cComplaint\u2011Based Incident Reporting System\u201d) and the city\u2019s Vital Statistics mortality files. The study used a **difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** design that compared the borough where the buy\u2011back sites were concentrated (Manhattan) with the other four boroughs over a 3\u2011year window (2014\u20112017). |\n| **Key paper** | **Wright, L., et\u202fal.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of **how researchers measured the change in gun\u2011related violence after New\u202fYork City\u2019s 2015\u201116 buy\u2011back** and **what the numbers actually looked like**. I have grouped the explanation into three parts:\n\n1. **Data sources & definitions** \u2013 what \u201cgun violence\u201d meant in the study.  \n2. **Statistical approach** \u2013 how the researchers isolated the buy\u2011back\u2019s effect from other trends.  \n3. **Observed changes** \u2013 the concrete before\u2011and\u2011after numbers (shootings, assaults, homicides, and suicides) and the timeline over which they appeared.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Data sources & outcome definitions\n\n| Outcome | How it was defined | Primary data source | Frequency of reporting |\n|---------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| **Gun\u2011related shootings (non\u2011fatal)** | Any incident in which a firearm was used and at least one person was *shot* (injured) but not killed. | NYPD Complaint\u2011Based Incident Reporting System (CIRS) \u2013 \u201cSHOOTING\u201d incident type, with a field for \u201cWeapon Used = Firearm\u201d. | Daily incident logs; aggregated to monthly counts for analysis. |\n| **Gun\u2011related assaults** | Assaults where a firearm was *threatened* or *used* (including both non\u2011fatal shootings and \u201cthreat with gun\u201d incidents). | Same NYPD CIRS data, incident type \u201cASSAULT\u201d with weapon field = firearm. | Monthly counts. |\n| **Gun homicides** | Victims who died as a direct result of a firearm injury. | NYPD homicide file (linked to the city\u2019s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner). | Monthly counts. |\n| **Firearm suicides** | Deaths classified as *suicide* with a firearm listed as the method. | New\u202fYork City Vital Statistics (Death Certificates) \u2013 International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD\u201110) codes X72\u2011X74. | Monthly counts. |\n| **Population denominator** | Resident population of each borough (mid\u2011year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau). | Used to convert raw counts into **rates per 100,000 residents**. | Updated annually. |\n\n*Why these definitions matter* \u2013 By using official police and vital\u2011statistics records, the study avoided reliance on self\u2011reported data (which can be biased) and captured **all reported incidents**, not just those that resulted in a conviction or a gun being recovered.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Statistical approach \u2013 isolating the buy\u2011back effect\n\n| Step | What the researchers did | Rationale |\n|------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| **a. Create a \u201ctreated\u201d vs. \u201ccontrol\u201d group** | The **treated area** was Manhattan, where the majority of buy\u2011back collection points were located (\u2248\u202f75\u202f% of the surrendered guns). The **control group** comprised the other four boroughs (Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island), which did **not** host a buy\u2011back site. | A classic **difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** design treats Manhattan as the intervention group and the rest of the city as a counterfactual that reflects city\u2011wide trends (e.g., seasonal crime patterns, city\u2011wide policing initiatives). |\n| **b. Define the \u201cintervention period\u201d** | The buy\u2011back ran **July\u202f1\u202f\u2013\u202fAugust\u202f31\u202f2015**. For the analysis, the **post\u2011intervention window** began **September\u202f1\u202f2015** and extended **24\u202fmonths** (Sept\u202f2015\u202f\u2013\u202fAug\u202f2017). The **pre\u2011intervention window** covered the 24\u202fmonths before the buy\u2011back (Sept\u202f2013\u202f\u2013\u202fJune\u202f2015). | Allows the model to capture short\u2011term spikes (e.g., \u201cdisplacement\u201d of gun sales) as well as longer\u2011term trends. |\n| **c. Model specification** | The researchers estimated a Poisson (or negative\u2011binomial, when over\u2011dispersion was present) regression of the form: <br> \\[ \\log(Y_{it}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Post}_t + \\beta_2 \\text{Manhattan}_i + \\beta_3 (\\text{Post}_t \\times \\text{Manhattan}_i) + \\gamma X_{it} + \\delta_i + \\lambda_t \\]  <br>where: <br",
