The antigen is taken up by dendritic cells in the skin or muscle and displayed on their surface. | The immune system \u201csees\u201d something that looks like the real germ, but it cannot cause disease. |\n| **2.\u202fActivation of adaptive immunity** | The antigen\u2011bearing dendritic cells travel to nearby lymph nodes, where they stimulate B\u2011cells (which will make antibodies) and T\u2011cells (which help B\u2011cells and can kill infected cells). | The body builds a targeted response that can be recalled quickly later. |\n| **3.\u202fMemory formation** | Some of the activated B\u2011 and T\u2011cells become long\u2011lived memory cells. | If the child later encounters the real pathogen, these memory cells launch a rapid, high\u2011affinity response that often prevents illness or makes it much milder. |\n| **4.\u202fOptional booster doses** | Additional doses (boosters) restimulate the memory pool, increasing the number and durability of protective antibodies. | Keeps protection high for many years, especially for pathogens that change over time (e.g., influenza). |\n\n### Key points about the immune response\n\n* **Antibodies** neutralize viruses or mark bacteria for destruction.  \n* **Cell\u2011mediated immunity** (CD8\u207a T\u2011cells) kills infected cells, important for viruses that hide inside cells.  \n* **Memory** can last years to a lifetime, depending on the disease and the vaccine platform.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fMain vaccine platforms used in children  \n\n| Platform | How it is made | Typical use in the pediatric schedule | Example of safety profile |\n|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Live\u2011attenuated** | Whole pathogen that has been weakened so it can\u2019t cause disease in healthy people. | Measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR), varicella (chickenpox), rotavirus (oral), yellow\u2011fever (travel). | Generally very safe; rare\u2011but\u2011possible: mild rash, low\u2011grade fever. In immunocompromised children, the attenuated virus can sometimes cause disease, so contraindicated. |\n| **Inactivated (killed) whole\u2011virus** | Pathogen is chemically or heat\u2011inactivated. | Polio (IPV), hepatitis A. | No risk of replication; local soreness and low\u2011grade fever are most common. |\n| **Protein subunit / recombinant** | Only a specific protein (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen, pertussis toxoid) is produced in yeast or bacterial cells. | Hepatitis B, HPV (given to pre\u2011teens), some pertussis components. | Very low reactogenicity; occasional injection\u2011site soreness, rare allergic reactions. |\n| **Conjugate** | Polysaccharide (sugar) capsule of a bacterium is chemically linked to a protein carrier, converting a T\u2011independent response into a T\u2011dependent one (stronger, with memory).",

This is called *primary vaccine failure* (the immune system never \u201csees\u201d the antigen strongly enough). | The second dose is **not a booster** in the classic sense; it is a *repeat* of the first exposure. It catches the ~5\u202f% who failed the first time, raising overall seroconversion to >\u202f99\u202f%. |\n| **Secondary\u2011vaccine\u2011failure (waning)** | Immunity after one dose is strong for several years, but a small proportion of children can experience a gradual decline in antibody levels, especially for mumps. | The second dose \u201cboosts\u201d antibody titers, providing a higher and more durable peak. For mumps, a second dose reduces the risk of waning by roughly 50\u202f% (see data below). |\n| **Population\u2011level impact** | With ~95\u202f% coverage of a single dose, the *effective* immune proportion is ~90\u202f% (because 5\u202f% of those vaccinated are still susceptible). This is **below** the herd\u2011immunity threshold for measles (\u2248\u202f92\u201195\u202f%). | Adding a second dose pushes the *effective* immune proportion to >\u202f99\u202f%, comfortably above the herd\u2011immunity threshold for measles and well above that for mumps and rubella. |\n| **Outbreak risk** | Outbreaks can start in schools or daycare centers where a few unprotected children cluster (e.g., under\u2011immunized communities, families that decline vaccines). | The second dose dramatically reduces the size of the susceptible pool, so even if a case is imported the chain of transmission is usually stopped after 1\u20132 secondary cases. |\n| **Regulatory / programmatic reason** | The original monovalent measles vaccine (1963) required two doses because the first dose was only ~85\u202f% effective. When MMR was introduced, the data showed a similar need for a repeat dose. | The schedule was codified in 1995 by the ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) after studies showed that **two doses gave >\u202f99\u202f% protection for measles and >\u202f97\u202f% for mumps**, compared with ~93\u202f% and ~88\u202f% after one dose, respectively. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.\u202fNumbers that illustrate the difference  \n\n### 1.1.
