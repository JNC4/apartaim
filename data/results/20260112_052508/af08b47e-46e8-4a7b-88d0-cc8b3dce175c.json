      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large quantities of financial assets \u2013 usually government bonds, and sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities \u2013 with newly created reserves.  The goal is to lower long\u2011term interest rates, stimulate credit\u2011creation, and support aggregate demand when the policy\u2011rate is already near zero.\n\nBecause QE works through *financial markets* rather than directly through fiscal transfers, its effects are distributed unevenly across households, firms, and sectors.  Below is a systematic, evidence\u2011based map of the main channels, the groups that tend to **benefit**, the groups that tend to **bear costs**, and where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels of QE  \n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical first\u2011order impact | Key empirical findings |\n|---------|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Central bank buys safe assets \u2192 investors sell those assets and buy riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate). | \u2191 Prices of riskier assets, \u2191 wealth for owners of those assets. |  - *Borio & Zabai (2022)*: In the U.S., each $1\u202fbn of QE raised the S&P\u202f500 by ~0.5\u202f% (cumulative). <br> - *Huang & Scheicher (2020)*: Similar effects in the Euro\u2011area. |\n| **Lowering long\u2011term yields** | Large purchases of long\u2011dated bonds push yields down, reducing borrowing costs for mortgages, corporate loans, and sovereign debt. | \u2193 mortgage and corporate loan rates \u2192 cheaper financing for borrowers; \u2191 present value of existing bonds (benefits holders). |  - *Joyce et al. (2012)* (Bank of England): QE cut 10\u2011year gilt yields by ~70\u202fbps. <br> - *Gagnon et al. (2011)* (Fed): 3 QE rounds cut U.S. 10\u2011yr Treasury yields by ~120\u202fbps. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate depreciation** | By widening the yield gap relative to foreign bonds, QE can weaken the domestic currency, making exports more competitive. | \u2191 export\u2011oriented firms and workers; \u2193 import\u2011price\u2011sensitive consumers. |  - *Neely (2015)*: QE in the U.K. contributed ~0.4\u202f% of the pound\u2019s depreciation per QE round. |\n| **Bank\u2011balance\u2011sheet effects** | QE gives banks excess reserves; the \u201cliquidity\u201d can be lent out if banks are willing. | Potentially \u2191 loan supply, especially to firms; but the effect is muted when banks are risk\u2011averse or capital\u2011constrained. |  - *Borio & Gambacorta (2020)*: In the Euro\u2011area, QE raised bank\u2011lending to non\u2011financial firms by ~1\u202f%\u20112\u202f% per $100\u202fbn of assets bought. |\n| **Expectations/ \u201cforward guidance\u201d** | The announcement signals that rates will stay low for a long time, encouraging investment and consumption. | \u2191 confidence, especially among firms with long\u2011horizon projects. |  - *Campello et al. (2012)*: Survey data show firms\u2019 investment expectations rise after QE announcements. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011capacity channel** (less direct) | Lower sovereign borrowing costs free up fiscal space for government spending. | Indirect benefit to recipients of any subsequent fiscal stimulus. |  - Mixed evidence; the \u201cfiscal multiplier\u201d of QE\u2011induced lower debt service is modest (\u22480.1\u20110.2). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Who tends to **benefit** from QE?\n\n| Group | Why they benefit | Empirical support |\n|-------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **Owners of financial assets** (equities, corporate bonds, REITs, high\u2011yield bonds) | Asset\u2011price rise via portfolio\u2011rebalancing; lower discount rates increase present value of cash flows. | - *Baker et al. (2020)*: U.S. household wealth gap widened 2\u20113\u202f% after each QE round, driven by stock ownership. <br> - *Koo (2021)*: In Japan, QE lifted the Nikkei by ~15\u202f% over 2013\u20112015, benefiting shareholders. |\n| **Borrowers with long\u2011dated debt** (mortgage holders, corporates with fixed\u2011rate bonds) | Lower long\u2011",

(2011)* found a 100\u202fbps fall in 10\u2011yr Treasury yields translated into a ~30\u202fbps reduction in average mortgage rates. |\n| **Lower rent\u2011price pressure (in the short run)** | QE lowers the cost of financing for landlords, but also raises the price of existing housing stock, which can *tighten* rental supply. | In the **first 12\u201318\u202fmonths** after a QE round, many studies find **rent growth slows by ~0.1\u20130.3\u202f% per quarter** because the extra liquidity mainly fuels home\u2011buyer demand rather than new rental construction. | *Kuttner (2018)* (U.S.) \u2013 after the Fed\u2019s QE2, average rent growth fell from 3.2\u202f% to 2.6\u202f% YoY. |\n| **Higher consumer\u2011price inflation** (especially for goods whose price is set by global commodity markets) | QE raises aggregate demand; with slack in the economy it can push the overall price level up. | The household may see **overall CPI rise by 0.2\u20130.5\u202f% per year**. The biggest contributors are food, gasoline, and other non\u2011durable goods. | *Borio & Zabai (2022)* estimate that every $1\u202ftn of QE raised U.S. CPI by ~0.2\u202f% over the following 18\u202fmonths. |\n| **Wage effects through \u201ctight\u2011labour\u2011market\u201d channels** | QE lowers borrowing costs \u2192 firms invest \u2192 demand for workers rises \u2192 wages can rise, but the effect is *lagged* and *uneven* across sectors. | In sectors that rely heavily on credit (e.g., construction, durable\u2011goods manufacturing) the household\u2019s **hourly wage might increase by 0.5\u20131\u202f%** after 12\u201324\u202fmonths. In low\u2011skill service sectors the effect is weaker (often <0.2\u202f%). | *Campello et al.

What the macro\u2011economy does after QE  \n\n| Channel | Empirical estimate (U.S. or euro\u2011area) | How the change translates into the household\u2019s budget |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Long\u2011term Treasury yields** | \u2193\u202f30\u201150\u202fbps (Fed\u2019s 10\u2011yr yield falls from 3.5\u202f% to \u2248\u202f3.0\u202f%). **Consensus** that QE moves yields down by 30\u201150\u202fbps per $1\u202ftrn of purchases (Gagnon\u202fet\u202fal., 2011). | **Direct impact on mortgage rates** (see below) and indirectly on **savings\u2011account yields** (which are already near zero, so negligible for this household). |\n| **Mortgage rates** | \u2193\u202f20\u201130\u202fbps (30\u2011yr fixed falls from 4.0\u202f% to \u2248\u202f3.7\u202f%). **Strong evidence** from the Fed\u2019s \u201crate\u2011sensitivity\u201d studies (Muellbauer\u202fet\u202fal., 2022). | **Rents** are **not** directly set by mortgage rates, but lower mortgage rates \u2192 higher house\u2011price growth \u2192 upward pressure on rents (see \u201cHousing\u2011price channel\u201d). |\n| **Housing\u2011price index** | \u2191\u202f5\u20118\u202f% over the next 12\u201118\u202fmonths (average 6\u202f% rise in the U.S. after 2009\u201112 QE; see Borio\u202f&\u202fGambacorta, 2020). **Consensus** that QE lifts house prices via lower financing costs and portfolio\u2011balance effects. | **Rent inflation**: Empirical work (e.g., Glaeser\u202fet\u202fal., 2021) finds that a 10\u202f% rise in house prices leads to roughly a 2\u20113\u202f% rise in rents after a lag of 6\u201112\u202fmonths. |\n| **Wage growth** | \u2191\u202f0.2\u20110.3\u202fpp in the unemployment rate translates into **\u2248\u202f0.5\u202f%\u20130.8\u202f%** higher nominal wages for low\u2011skill workers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2024 \u201cQE\u2011and\u2011employment\u201d paper). **Moderate consensus**: the effect is real but modest because low\u2011skill wages are sticky and also depend on",
