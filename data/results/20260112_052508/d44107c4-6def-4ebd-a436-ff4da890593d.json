      "unknown_model_response": "Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causing the disease itself. Most childhood vaccines contain either:\n\n1. **Inactivated (killed) pathogens** \u2013 these cannot cause disease but still present enough of the organism\u2019s proteins to stimulate an immune response.\n2. **Live\u2011attenuated pathogens** \u2013 these are weakened forms of the germ that can replicate a little but are not strong enough to cause illness in healthy individuals.\n3. **Subunit, recombinant, or polysaccharide components** \u2013 these include only parts of the germ (such as proteins or sugars) that are sufficient to trigger immunity.\n4. **mRNA or viral\u2011vector platforms** \u2013 newer technologies that deliver genetic instructions for cells to produce a harmless piece of the pathogen (e.g., the spike protein of a virus), prompting an immune response.\n\nWhen a vaccine is administered, the immune system reacts by producing antibodies and activating T\u2011cells that \u201cremember\u201d the pathogen. If the child later encounters the real disease, these immune defenses can recognize and neutralize it quickly, often preventing infection altogether or dramatically reducing its severity.\n\n### Typical Benefits\n- **Individual protection**: Reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, complications, and death from the targeted disease.\n- **Community (herd) immunity**: When a high proportion of the population is immunized, disease spread is limited, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants too young for certain vaccines, immunocompromised individuals).\n- **Eradication and control**: Widespread vaccination has eliminated or drastically reduced diseases such as polio, measles, diphtheria, and whooping cough in many regions.\n\n### Common, Usually Mild Side Effects\n| Side Effect | Typical Onset | Duration | Frequency |\n|------------|---------------|----------|-----------|\n| **Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site** | Within minutes to a few hours | 1\u20133 days | 1 in 2\u20133 doses |\n| **Low\u2011grade fever** | 12\u201348\u202fhours after vaccination | 1\u20132 days | 1 in 5\u201310 doses |\n| **Mild rash or soreness** | 1\u20133 days post\u2011vaccination | A few days | Variable, generally <\u202f5\u202f% |\n| **Tiredness or irritability** | Same day or next day | Up to 24\u202fhours | Common, especially in infants |\n| **Fainting (vasovagal response)** | During or shortly after injection | Brief | More common in adolescents |\n\nThese reactions are typically short\u2011lived and resolve without medical intervention. They are signals that the immune system is responding to the vaccine.\n\n### Rare, More Serious Adverse Events\n- **Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)** \u2013 Occur in approximately 1 per\u202fmillion doses; immediate medical treatment (e.g., epinephrine) is effective.\n- **Febrile seizures** \u2013 Rarely seen after certain vaccines (e.g., MMR); generally self\u2011limited and not associated with long\u2011term neurologic problems.\n- **Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)** \u2013 Very rare (about 1\u20132 cases per\u202fmillion doses for some vaccines); a temporary autoimmune condition that usually improves with care.\n\nHealth authorities (e.g., the World Health Organization, the U.S. CDC, the European Medicines Agency) continuously monitor vaccine safety through large\u2011scale surveillance systems. The overall risk of serious adverse events is far lower than",
