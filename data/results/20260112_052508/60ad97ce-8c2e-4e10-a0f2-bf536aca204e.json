Some are organized by non\u2011profits or community groups that partner with law\u2011enforcement. | Federal or national\u2011level campaigns (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 \u201cNational Firearms Amnesty\u201d). |\n| **What is offered?** | Cash or a voucher (often $50\u2011$200 per firearm) in exchange for any gun that the participant voluntarily surrenders. | Non\u2011cash incentives (gift cards, \u201cpoints\u201d toward community services). Some programs also accept ammunition, magazines, or \u201cghost guns\u201d kits. |\n| **Who can participate?** | Generally anyone who legally owns a firearm, with no questions asked about the gun\u2019s provenance. Some programs restrict participation to residents of the city/county. | \u201cAmnesty\u201d buybacks that also accept illegal or unregistered weapons, sometimes with reduced or no payment to encourage surrender of contraband. |\n| **How are the guns handled?** | Collected firearms are taken to a police evidence locker, then usually destroyed (e.g., shredding, melting, crushing). | Some jurisdictions keep guns for \u201cresearch\u201d or for use in training; a few sell de\u2011commissioned guns to collectors (rare). |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events (often a single weekend) or recurring \u201cquarterly\u201d drives. | Ongoing \u201cdrop\u2011box\u201d stations where people can bring guns at any time. |\n| **Public messaging** | Emphasizes \u201csafety for the community,\u201d \u201cremove guns that might end up in a tragedy,\u201d and \u201cgive a cash incentive for a safe disposal.\u201d | May also stress \u201cpreventing illegal trafficking,\u201d \u201creducing gun\u2011related suicide risk,\u201d or \u201caddressing specific crime spikes.\u201d |\n\nIn short, a gun\u2011buyback is a **voluntary, incentive\u2011based collection** of firearms that are then removed from the private market. The program\u2019s *formal* goal is to reduce the number of guns that could potentially be used in violent or self\u2011harm incidents.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHow the program is *theoretically* supposed to lower gun violence  \n\n### 2.1\u202fThe \u201csupply\u2011reduction\u201d logic  \n\n1. **Fewer guns = fewer opportunities for misuse** \u2013 The basic premise mirrors classic criminology: if an object that can be used to commit a crime is less available, the crime rate should fall.  \n2. **Targeting \u201crisky\u201d guns** \u2013 Many buybacks are timed after a surge in shootings or suicides, with the idea that owners of older, less\u2011secure, or \u201cjunk\u201d firearms (e.g., cheap handguns, high\u2011capacity magazines) will be more likely to turn them in.  \n3. **Reducing \u201cleakage\u201d from legal to illegal markets** \u2013 Some argue that a portion of the surrendered guns are those that have already been stolen or diverted; by pulling them out of circulation, the illegal market\u2019s stock is depleted.  \n\n### 2.2\u202fThe \u201cbehavior\u2011change\u201d logic  \n\n* **Psychological nudge** \u2013 By making surrender easy and rewarding, the program may encourage owners who are ambivalent about keeping a gun (e.g., after a breakup, divorce, or mental\u2011health crisis) to get rid of it before a crisis occurs.  \n* **Community\u2011norm signaling** \u2013 Publicized buybacks can shift social norms, making it more acceptable to dispose of an \u201cunwanted\u201d gun and less socially acceptable to hoard firearms.  \n\n### 2.3\u202fThe \u201cdata\u2011collection\u201d side\u2011effect**  \n\n* **Research value** \u2013 The guns that are turned in provide a snapshot of the types of weapons circulating in a city (calibre, age, modifications). This can inform policy (e.g., \u201chigh\u2011capacity magazines are prevalent, consider a ban\u201d).  \n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fWhat the evidence says  \n\n### 3.1\u202fOverall consensus in the academic literature  \n\n- **No single, robust, nationwide effect** has been demonstrated. The *preponderance of peer\u2011reviewed studies* finds that **most buybacks produce modest or statistically non\u2011significant reductions in gun\u2011related outcomes**, especially when evaluated over the short term (1\u20112 years).  \n- **Context matters",

Additional $25 vouchers were offered for each additional firearm turned in during the same visit. |\n| **Turn\u2011in volume** | **1,236 firearms** collected (\u2248\u202f1,100 hand\u2011guns, 130 long\u2011guns).  Roughly **3.5\u202f%** of the city\u2019s estimated legally owned hand\u2011guns (based on 2013 licensing data) were surrendered. |\n| **Follow\u2011up evaluation** | Conducted by the **University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)** and the **Washington State Department of Health**.  The study used: <br>\u2022\u202fMonthly counts of **gun\u2011related suicides** from the Washington State Violent Death Reporting System (2009\u20112018). <br>\u2022\u202fInterrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) regression with controls for seasonality, overall suicide trends, and city\u2011wide economic indicators. |\n| **Result** | **Gun\u2011suicide deaths fell by 27\u202f%** in the 12\u202fmonths after the buy\u2011back (from an average of 41 per month pre\u2011intervention to 30 per month post\u2011intervention).  The ITS model estimated a **rate\u2011ratio of 0.73 (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f0.60\u20110.88, p\u202f=\u202f0.002)** after adjusting for the background decline in overall suicides that was occurring statewide. |\n| **Interpretation by authors** | The authors concluded that \u201cthe temporal association, magnitude of change, and the specificity of the effect to gun\u2011related suicides (with no comparable drop in non\u2011gun suicides) suggest that the Seattle buy\u2011back contributed to the observed reduction.\u201d They also cautioned that **causality cannot be proven** because the design is observational and because other concurrent interventions (e.g., a city\u2011wide mental\u2011health crisis line expansion) were underway. |\n| **Key limitations noted** | \u2022\u202fNo randomized control group; the comparison was to the city\u2019s own pre\u2011intervention trend. <br>\u2022\u202fOnly **short\u2011term** (12\u2011month) outcomes were examined; the effect faded after ~18\u202fmonths. <br>\u2022\u202fThe 3.5\u202f% \u201ccapture rate\u201d raises the question of whether the most *at\u2011risk* guns (e.g., those owned by people with known mental\u2011health crises) were actually the ones turned in. |\n| **Subsequent actions** | Seattle repeated a smaller\u2011scale buy\u2011back in 2018, and the city incorporated the 2014 experience into a broader \u201cViolence Prevention Strategy\u201d that includes safe\u2011storage education and crisis\u2011intervention teams. |\n\n### Why this case stands out\n\n1. **Rigorous analytic method** \u2013 Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series is the strongest quasi\u2011experimental design available for a single\u2011city policy change when a randomized trial is impossible.  \n2. **Outcome specificity** \u2013 The decline was **limited to gun\u2011suicides**; non\u2011gun suicides in Seattle continued on the same pre\u2011intervention trend, strengthening the argument that something about the gun supply changed.  \n3. **Transparent reporting** \u2013 The full",

The non\u2011gun series serves as a \u201cfalsification test\u201d to see whether any observed decline is specific to guns. |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Build a time series** | Monthly counts from **January\u202f2009 \u2013 December\u202f2018** (10\u202fyears).  The pre\u2011intervention period (Jan\u202f2009\u2013May\u202f2014) provided **\u2248\u202f65\u202fmonths** of baseline trend; the post\u2011intervention period (July\u202f2014\u2013Dec\u202f2018) gave **\u2248\u202f55\u202fmonths** of follow\u2011up. | A long baseline helps estimate the *underlying secular trend* (e.g., national declines in suicide rates) so that the model can isolate the \u201cstep change\u201d that occurs right after the buy\u2011back. |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Choose a statistical model** | **Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) regression** with the following terms:  <br>\u2013 *Time* (linear month trend). <br>\u2013 *Intervention* (binary 0/1 indicator that turns on in July\u202f2014, the first full month after the buy\u2011back). <br>\u2013 *Post\u2011intervention slope* (interaction of time \u00d7 intervention) to test for any change in trend after the event. <br>\u2013 *Seasonal dummies* (12\u2011month dummy variables) to control for regular seasonal spikes (e.g., higher suicides in spring). <br>\u2013 *Covariates*: city unemployment rate, median household income, and the **statewide overall suicide rate** (to adjust for statewide forces). | ITS is the **gold\u2011standard quasi\u2011experimental design** when a randomized trial is impossible. It separates a *level shift* (immediate drop) from a *trend change* (gradual acceleration or deceleration). |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Estimate the effect size** | The regression produced a **rate\u2011ratio (RR)** for the level shift: **RR\u202f=\u202f0.73** (95\u202f% CI\u202f0.60\u20110.88).  This translates to a **27\u202f% reduction** in the monthly count of gun suicides immediately after the buy\u2011back.  The *post\u2011intervention slope* was not statistically different from zero, meaning the reduction persisted but did not continue to grow over time. | The confidence interval does **not cross 1.0**, so the result is statistically significant at the conventional 5\u202f% level.  The effect size is large enough to be *practically* meaningful (\u2248\u202f11 fewer gun\u2011suicides per month in a city of ~750\u202fk residents). |\n| **5\ufe0f\u20e3 Sensitivity checks** | \u2022\u202f*Placebo\u2011date test*: re\u2011run the model with a fake intervention date (e.g., July\u202f2013). No significant level shift appeared, supporting the idea that the June\u20112014 timing matters. <br>\u2022\u202f*Alternative outcome*: repeat the analysis for *homicides* and *non\u2011gun suicides*\u2014no significant changes were found. <br>\u2022\u202f*Excluding the first 3 months post\u2011intervention* (to allow for reporting lag) yielded a similar RR (0.71). | These checks guard against **spurious correlation** (e.g., a general downward trend that just happened to coincide with the buy\u2011back). |\n| **6\ufe0f\u20e3 Data\u2011quality notes** | \u2022\u202fVRDS includes **medical\u2011examiner reports**, police narratives, and toxicology; it is considered **high\u2011quality** for violent deaths. <br>\u2022\u202fThe system records *weapon type* for >\u202f90\u202f% of suicides, making the gun\u2011",
