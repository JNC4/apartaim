      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are contracts between two or more countries that reduce or eliminate tariffs, import quotas, and other barriers to the movement of goods, services, and, in many cases, investment and labour.**  \nThe way these arrangements filter down to workers depends on a mix of macro\u2011economic forces, sector\u2011specific dynamics, institutional settings, and the design of the agreement itself. Below is a synthesis of the most frequently cited mechanisms, the empirical evidence that supports them, and the points that remain contested.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The core channels through which FTAs can affect workers\n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical short\u2011run impact on workers | Typical long\u2011run impact on workers |\n|---------|--------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Trade\u2011creation** \u2013 lower tariffs make imported goods cheaper and open new export markets for domestic producers. | Firms that can compete internationally expand, hire more labour, and often invest in productivity\u2011enhancing technology. | **Potential job growth** in export\u2011oriented sectors (e.g., manufacturing, agribusiness). | **Higher real wages** in expanding sectors if productivity gains are shared; may also raise overall employment if the economy can absorb displaced workers. |\n| **Trade\u2011diversion** \u2013 imports shift from non\u2011member countries to cheaper member\u2011country sources. | Domestic firms that cannot compete with lower\u2011cost imports may cut output or close. | **Job losses** in protected or less\u2011competitive industries (e.g., low\u2011skill manufacturing in high\u2011wage economies). | Workers may move to other sectors, but the speed and quality of re\u2011employment depend on labour\u2011market flexibility and training programmes. |\n| **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) incentives** \u2013 many FTAs contain \u201cinvestment\u2011protection\u201d chapters that encourage multinational firms to set up plants. | New plants can create jobs, often with higher skill requirements and better wages than the displaced jobs. | **Job creation** (often in \u201cexport\u2011oriented\u201d or \u201cassembly\u201d plants). | Over time, **skill upgrading** and **wage convergence** toward the multinational\u2019s home\u2011country standards, but also risk of \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d if labour regulations are weak. |\n| **Labor\u2011standards clauses** \u2013 some newer FTAs include commitments to uphold minimum wages, occupational\u2011health\u2011and\u2011safety, or the right to unionise. | Sets a floor for working conditions and can reduce a \u201ccost advantage\u201d of low\u2011wage competitors. | **Limited immediate effect** (enforcement varies). | **Potential improvement** in wages and safety where clauses are enforced; otherwise, little change. |\n| **Adjustment costs** \u2013 the transition from declining to expanding sectors. | Workers may need retraining, relocation, or temporary income support. | **Short\u2011run income loss** for displaced workers; possible increase in under\u2011employment or unemployment. | **Long\u2011run net gain** only if adjustment mechanisms (e.g., active labour\u2011market policies) are effective. |\n| **Wage\u2011distribution effects** \u2013 gains from trade are not evenly spread across skill levels. | High\u2011skill workers often capture productivity gains; low\u2011skill workers may face competition from cheaper imports. | **Polarisation**: rising wages for college\u2011educated, stagnant or falling wages for low\u2011skill. | The magnitude of polarisation varies with the country\u2019s education system, union density, and social safety net. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Why Chile is a useful illustration\n\n| Feature | Why it matters for assessing the labour impact |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Small, open economy** | Trade policy changes are easier to isolate from other macro shocks. |\n| **Well\u2011documented baseline** | The World Bank, OECD and Chilean statistics provide detailed sector\u2011level data on wages, employment, and productivity before and after 2004. |\n| **Complementary reforms** | The FTA was accompanied by modest labour\u2011market reforms (e.g., a more flexible hiring\u2011firing regime) and a strong social safety net, allowing researchers to separate the pure trade effect from policy \u201cnoise.\u201d |\n| **Sectoral diversity** | Chile exports both primary commodities (copper, fruit, wine) and services (tourism, finance).
