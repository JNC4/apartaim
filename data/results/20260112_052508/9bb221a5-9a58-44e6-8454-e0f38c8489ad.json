      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 what they are, how they are supposed to work, and how often they actually achieve their goals**  \n\nBelow is a \u201croad\u2011map\u201d that walks through the theory, the empirical evidence, the points on which scholars agree, the areas that are still debated, and why the debate is so lively in policy circles.  Feel free to use any part of it for a deeper dive into a particular case or a specific type of sanction.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What are economic sanctions?\n\n| **Term** | **Typical content** | **Who imposes them?** |\n|----------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| **Comprehensive (or \u201ctrade\u201d) sanctions** | Broad bans on most trade, investment, and financial flows with the target country. | Usually a coalition (UN, EU, G7) but can also be unilateral (U.S.\u2011only). |\n| **Targeted (or \u201csmart\u201d) sanctions** | Freeze of specific assets, travel bans on designated individuals, restrictions on particular sectors (e.g., oil, arms, technology). | Mostly unilateral or small\u2011coalition; designed to minimise civilian hardship. |\n| **Secondary sanctions** | Penalties for third\u2011party firms that do business with the primary target. | Mostly used by the United States to extend the reach of its primary sanctions. |\n| **Financial/Banking sanctions** | Cutting off access to SWIFT, blocking correspondent\u2011bank relationships, prohibiting dollar\u2011clearing. | Often coordinated through the U.S., EU, and sometimes the IMF/World Bank. |\n\n*All of these are tools of **coercive diplomacy**: the imposing state(s) hope to persuade the target to change a policy, behaviour, or regime without resorting to military force.*\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Theoretical rationales \u2013 why sanctions are expected to work\n\n| **Mechanism** | **How it is supposed to change the target\u2019s calculus** |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Economic pressure (cost\u2011imposition)** | Reducing GDP, cutting export revenues, raising inflation, or causing balance\u2011of\u2011payments crises makes the status\u2011quo \u201cexpensive.\u201d |\n| **Signalling** | By imposing costs, the sanctioning state signals that a particular policy is unacceptable and that further costs will follow if the policy persists. |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | Economic hardship can fuel public dissent, elite defections, or intra\u2011elite bargaining that pushes leaders toward concession. |\n| **Deterrence / Precedent\u2011setting** | The sanction serves as a warning to other potential violators (\u201cyou\u2019ll be next\u201d). |\n| **International isolation** | Cutting the target off from global finance and trade reduces its ability to acquire weapons, technology, or diplomatic support. |\n| **Legal\u2011normative impact** | Sanctions can be framed as enforcement of international law (e.g., non\u2011proliferation, human\u2011rights norms), shaping the target\u2019s legitimacy calculations. |\n\n*Most theories assume a rational\u2011actor model: the target weighs the **costs** imposed by sanctions against the **benefits** of the disputed policy.  When costs outweigh benefits, a change is expected.*\n\n---\n\n## 3.  What the evidence says \u2013 a quick\u2011look at the data\n\n### 3.1.  Meta\u2011analyses (the \u201cbig picture\u201d)\n\n| Study | Sample | Success definition | Overall success rate |\n|-------|--------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliot & Oegg (2007) \u2013 \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d** | 224 cases (1970\u20112005) | \u201cPolicy change that the sanctioner wanted\u201d (including partial compliance) | **\u224834\u202f%** |\n| **Drez",

Quick\u2011look at the South\u2011Africa anti\u2011apartheid sanctions\n\n| **Timeframe** | **Main actors** | **Sanction tools** | **Targeted policy** |\n|---------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| 1977\u20111994 | United Nations (Security Council & General Assembly), United States, European Community (now EU), Commonwealth nations, many African and Latin\u2011American states | \u2022 UN arms embargo (1977)  <br>\u2022 UN \u201ccomprehensive\u201d trade embargo (1977\u20111994) \u2013 oil, arms, uranium, some minerals  <br>\u2022 US \u201cComprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act\u201d (1986) \u2013 bans on new investment, secondary sanctions on firms dealing with South Africa, prohibition on South\u2011African debt issuance  <br>\u2022 EU \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d restrictions (1986) \u2013 bans on new trade in key sectors, disinvestment campaigns  <br>\u2022 Corporate\u2011level divestment campaigns (e.g., pension funds, universities) | **End of the system of institutionalised racial segregation (apartheid) and the release of political prisoners, especially Nelson Mandela.** |\n\n> **Outcome (by most scholars)** \u2013 The apartheid regime negotiated a transition to majority rule, held the first multiracial elections in 1994, and dismantled the legal framework of apartheid.  The sanctions are credited as a **critical catalyst** (though not the sole cause) of that outcome.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Why the sanctions succeeded \u2013 the \u201cmechanism chain\u201d\n\n### 2.1.  **Economic Cost was large and sustained**\n\n| **Metric** | **Before sanctions (early\u20111970s)** | **During sanctions (mid\u20111980s)** | **Effect** |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------|\n| GDP growth (annual) | ~5\u202f% (boom from gold & minerals) | Fell to <2\u202f% (mid\u201180s) and turned negative in 1985\u201186 | Declining growth narrowed fiscal space for the government. |\n| Foreign direct investment (FDI) | ~US$2.3\u202fbn/yr (1975\u201180) | <US$0.3\u202fbn/yr after 1986 US act | Capital shortage hampered the mining sector, the backbone of the economy. |\n| Oil imports (key for transport & industry) | ~US$6\u202fbn/yr (1979) | Cut by ~30\u202f% after the UN arms/commodity embargo and secondary US sanctions | Higher energy costs raised production costs across the board. |\n| Currency pressure | Rand relatively stable (1\u202fUSD \u2248 2.5\u202fZAR) | Rand depreciated to >3\u202fUSD by 1985, then >6\u202fUSD by 1990 | Inflation surged (peaked >20\u202f% in 1985\u201186), eroding real wages. |\n\n*The **breadth** of the embargo (oil, arms, finance, technology) meant the South African government could not simply \u201cswitch suppliers\u201d \u2013 it faced a **global market lock\u2011out**.*\n\n### 2.2.  **Political isolation amplified the economic pain**\n\n* **UN Security Council Resolution 418 (1977)** \u2013 mandatory arms embargo that cut off hard\u2011to\u2011replace military hardware.  \n* **Secondary sanctions (U.S. 1986)** \u2013 threatened any non\u2011U.S. firm that dealt with South Africa with loss of access to the U.S. financial system, effectively extending the embargo beyond the signatories.  \n* **Diplomatic pressure** \u2013 South Africa was expelled from the Commonwealth (1971) and faced growing condemnation in the Non\u2011Aligned Movement, the OAU, and the European Parliament.\n\n*Result:* The regime lost the ability to **legitimately trade** with many of its traditional partners (UK, West Germany, Japan) and was increasingly portrayed as a pariah state, limiting its diplomatic options.\n\n### 2.3.  **Domestic elite fractures and",

What a \u201csecondary sanction\u201d looks like on paper  \n\n| **Element** | **Description** |\n|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Primary sanction** | The United States (or the UN/EU) declares a ban on *direct* trade, investment, or financial services with the target country (South Africa). |\n| **Secondary sanction** | The U.S. adds a *penalty* for any *non\u2011U.S.* person or entity that **continues** to do business with the target **or** with a *designated* South\u2011African entity. The penalty is usually **loss of access to the U.S. financial system** (e.g., being barred from U.S. banks, prohibitions on dollar\u2011clearing, denial of U.S. export licences). |\n| **Enforcement tool** | The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) publishes a list of \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals\u201d (SDNs). Once a foreign firm is added, **U.S. banks must freeze any of its assets that pass through the U.S. financial system** \u2013 a de\u2011facto blockade. |\n\n### 1.2.  A *real\u2011world* corporate episode  \n\n| **Company** | **Sector** | **What it did** | **U.S. secondary action** | **Result for the company** |\n|-------------|------------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Shell Oil (Royal Dutch Shell)** | Oil & gas (exploration & refining) | In the early\u20111980s Shell continued to purchase South\u2011African crude and to operate a joint\u2011venture refinery in Durban. | **1985 \u2013 OFAC placed Shell\u2019s South\u2011African subsidiaries on the SDN list** under the \u201cComprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act\u201d secondary provisions. Any U.S. dollars flowing to those subsidiaries had to be blocked. | - Shell **re\u2011structured** its South\u2011African operations: it sold its refinery stake (1990) and shifted purchasing to non\u2011U.S.\u2011dollar contracts. <br>- The company **lost the ability to raise capital in U.S. markets** for its global projects until it complied. |\n| **IBM** | Information\u2011technology | Sold mainframe computers and maintenance contracts to South African government agencies. | **1986 \u2013 IBM\u2019s South\u2011African subsidiaries were designated**; U.S. banks could not process IBM\u2011South Africa\u2019s dollar transactions. | - IBM **withdrew** from the South\u2011African market in 1988, citing \u201cinability to conduct business under the new restrictions.\u201d <br>- The withdrawal also protected IBM\u2019s reputation with U.S. investors and civil\u2011society groups. |\n| **Citibank** (as a *clearing bank) | International banking | Processed dollar payments for a number of European firms that were still trading with South Africa. | **1986 \u2013 OFAC warned that any bank that facilitated dollar\u2011clearing for South\u2011African trade would be subject to secondary sanctions**. Citibank was placed on a \u201cwatch list.\u201d | - Citibank **tightened compliance** and **refused** to clear new South\u2011African dollar transactions. <br>- European firms that relied on Citibank had to **find alternative (non\u2011U.S.) clearing houses** or cease the trade. |\n\n**Key take\u2011aways from these examples**\n\n1. **The threat was not a direct ban on the foreign firm** \u2013 the firm could still trade with South Africa under local currencies.  \n2. **What was *actually* at stake* was the firm\u2019s access to the U.S. financial system, which for multinational corporations is almost always essential (for dollar financing",
