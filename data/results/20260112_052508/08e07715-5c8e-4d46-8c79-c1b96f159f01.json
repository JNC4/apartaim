      "unknown_model_response": "**How 5G signals differ from 4G/3G and what the science says about health**\n\n---\n\n### 1. The technical differences\n\n| Feature | 3G | 4G (LTE) | 5G |\n|---------|----|----------|----|\n| **Frequency bands** | Mostly below 2\u202fGHz (e.g., 800\u202fMHz, 1.9\u202fGHz) | 600\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f2.6\u202fGHz (plus some 3.5\u202fGHz \u201cmid\u2011band\u201d) | \u2022 Low\u2011band: 600\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f900\u202fMHz (similar to 4G)<br>\u2022 Mid\u2011band: 2.5\u202fGHz\u202f\u2013\u202f4\u202fGHz (e.g., 3.5\u202fGHz)<br>\u2022 High\u2011band (mmWave): 24\u202fGHz\u202f\u2013\u202f40\u202fGHz (sometimes up to 100\u202fGHz) |\n| **Wavelength** | ~15\u201340\u202fcm | ~12\u201350\u202fcm | Low\u2011band ~30\u201350\u202fcm, mid\u2011band ~10\u201315\u202fcm, mmWave ~7\u201312\u202fmm |\n| **Power output (EIRP)** | Up to a few watts per sector | Up to several tens of watts per sector | Similar maximum EIRP limits (regulated by national agencies); mmWave cells use much lower power because the signal attenuates quickly. |\n| **Antenna design** | Large, omnidirectional panels | Larger panels, some sectorization | **Massive MIMO**: many small antenna elements that can steer beams very precisely, reducing the need for high transmit power in any one direction. |\n| **Cell size** | Hundreds of meters to a few kilometers | Hundreds of meters to a few kilometers | Low\u2011band cells similar to 4G, but **mid\u2011band** and especially **mmWave** cells are much smaller (tens of meters) and are often placed on street furniture, lampposts, or building facades. |\n\n**Key point:** 5G does not *invent* a new kind of radiation. All cellular technologies use **non\u2011ionizing radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields** (EMF). The main differences are the **frequency range** (some higher frequencies) and the **use of many more, smaller antennas** that can focus energy more narrowly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What \u201cnon\u2011ionizing\u201d means\n\n* **Ionizing radiation** (e.g., X\u2011rays, gamma rays) carries enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, potentially damaging DNA.\n* **Non\u2011ionizing radiation** (radio, microwave, infrared, visible light) does **not** have enough photon energy to break chemical bonds. The primary known biological effect at sufficient exposure levels is **thermal heating** (the same principle that makes a microwave oven heat food).\n\nCellular RF, including 5G, falls well below the ionization threshold. The principal safety question therefore revolves around **whether the exposure levels could cause harmful heating** or any other non\u2011thermal biological effect.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Regulatory exposure limits\n\nNational and international bodies set exposure limits based on decades of research:\n\n| Agency | Guideline reference | Typical limit for public exposure (in the 2\u20136\u202fGHz range) |\n|--------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **ICNIRP** (International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection) | ICNIRP Guidelines (2020) | Power density \u2264 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (\u2248 2\u202fmW/cm\u00b2) |\n| **IEEE** (Electromagnetic Compatibility Society) | IEEE C95.1\u20112019 | Same order of magnitude as ICNIRP |\n| **FCC** (U.S.) | FCC OET\u201169A | Power density \u2264 1\u202fmW/cm\u00b2 (\u2248 10\u202fW/m\u00b2) |\n\nCell\u2011",
