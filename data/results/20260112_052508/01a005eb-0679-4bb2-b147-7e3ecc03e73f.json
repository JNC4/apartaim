The basic immunologic principle\n\n1. **The immune system\u2019s job** \u2013 It learns to recognise \u201cnon\u2011self\u201d molecules (antigens) and, after an encounter, can mount a rapid, effective response if the same pathogen shows up again.  \n2. **Vaccines are a \u201cpractice run.\u201d**  \n   * They contain a **safe, limited exposure** to an antigen (or a piece of it) that mimics the real pathogen but does not cause the disease.  \n   * The immune system builds **memory B\u2011cells** (produce antibodies) and **memory T\u2011cells** (help destroy infected cells). When the child later meets the wild\u2011type pathogen, the response is faster and often prevents infection altogether.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Main vaccine platforms used in routine childhood schedules\n\n| Platform | How it works | Typical examples in the U.S./Europe/WHO schedule |\n|----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Live\u2011attenuated** | Whole virus/bacteria that has been weakened so it replicates only a short time, not causing disease in healthy people. | Measles\u2011Mumps\u2011Rubella (MMR), Varicella (chickenpox), Rotavirus (some brands), Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV, used in many low\u2011income countries). |\n| **Inactivated (killed)** | Pathogen is chemically or physically killed; cannot replicate. | Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), Hepatitis\u202fA, Rabies (rare in childhood schedule). |\n| **Subunit / protein\u2011based** | Only specific proteins or sugars (e.g., capsular polysaccharide, purified proteins). Often combined with an adjuvant to boost response. | DTaP (diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb), Hepatitis\u202fB, Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13). |\n| **Toxoid** | Inactivated toxin (e.g., diphtheria, tetanus) that trains the immune system to neutralise the toxin rather than the organism itself. | DTaP, Tdap. |\n| **Viral vector** | A harmless virus (often adenovirus) carries a gene that codes for a pathogen protein. The vector delivers the gene into cells, which then make the protein and trigger immunity. | No routine childhood vaccine yet, but the technology underlies the COVID\u201119 vaccines (e.g., AstraZeneca, J&J). |\n| **mRNA** | Messenger RNA encoding a viral protein is packaged in lipid nanoparticles; cells translate the mRNA into protein, which stimulates immunity. | COVID\u201119 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer\u2011BioNTech, Moderna) \u2013 not part of the standard infant schedule yet, but the platform is being evaluated for future pediatric vaccines (e.g., RSV, influenza). |\n| **DNA / plasmid** | Circular DNA (plasmid) is injected; host cells express the antigen. Still experimental in children. | None in routine use yet. |\n\n*All of these platforms have been studied in large, multi\u2011country clinical trials and are subject to ongoing post\u2011licensure safety monitoring.*\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Wherever possible the level of scientific consensus is highlighted, and where uncertainty remains it is noted.

The resulting strain is genetically stable and has been tested repeatedly for re\u2011version risk. |\n\n*Bottom line:* an attenuated virus is **still a virus**, but it has been \u201ctuned down\u201d so that it can\u2019t cause the illness the wild\u2011type virus would.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How the three component strains are created and characterised  \n\n| Component | Original wild\u2011type virus | Attenuation method | Typical reduction in virulence (fold) |\n|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Measles (Edmonston\u2011B strain)** | Isolated in 1954 from a child with natural measles. | Serial passage (>\u202f70\u202ftimes) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and chicken embryo fibroblasts, followed by selection of a temperature\u2011sensitive mutant that replicates poorly at 37\u202f\u00b0C (core body temperature). | \u2248\u202f10\u2074\u201110\u2075\u2011fold reduction in neurovirulence (ability to infect brain tissue). |\n| **Mumps (Jeryl\u2011Lynn strain)** | Isolated in 1967 from a child named Jeryl Lynn. | 33 passages in chick embryo fibroblasts, then 5 passages in Vero cells (African\u2011green\u2011monkey kidney cells). | \u2248\u202f10\u2076\u2011fold reduction in neurovirulence; no documented cases of mumps encephalitis from the vaccine strain. |\n| **Rubella (RA\u201127/3 strain)** | Isolated from a 1969 rubella outbreak in the United States. | 11 passages in human diploid fibroblasts, then 5 passages in Vero cells, followed by a \u201ccold\u2011adapted\u201d selection step (growth at 30\u202f\u00b0C). | \u2248\u202f10\u2074\u2011fold reduction in teratogenicity; no rubella\u2011associated birth defects from vaccine exposure. |\n\n**Key laboratory checks after attenuation**\n\n1. **Growth\u2011curve comparison** \u2013 the attenuated strain is measured for how many plaque\u2011forming units (PFU) it produces at 37\u202f\u00b0C versus the wild\u2011type. A steep decline confirms temperature\u2011sensitive loss of fitness.  \n2. **Animal neurovirulence tests** \u2013 newborn mice or hamsters are inoculated intracerebrally; the attenuated strain causes no disease at doses that would be lethal for the wild\u2011type.  \n3. **Genomic sequencing** \u2013 modern whole\u2011genome sequencing confirms the presence of the known attenuation\u2011associated mutations and checks that no re\u2011version\u2011prone sites are present.  \n4. **Stability passages** \u2013 the vaccine seed lot is passaged 10\u201315 additional times (the \u201cmanufacturing passage\u201d) and re\u2011tested for virulence to prove that the attenuated phenotype does **not** revert.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Manufacturing under strict quality\u2011control (GMP)  \n\n1. **Seed\u2011lot system** \u2013 a master seed (the original attenuated virus) is stored frozen at\u202f\u2013\u202f150\u202f\u00b0C. From this, a **working seed** is prepared for each production batch. The master seed is never used directly in a vaccine vial, which prevents cumulative mutations.  \n2. **Cell\u2011culture production** \u2013 the viruses are grown in **Vero cells** (a well\u2011characterised, continuous cell",
