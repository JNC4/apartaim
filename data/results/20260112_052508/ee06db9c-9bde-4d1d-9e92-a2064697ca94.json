      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to generate a mix of **positive and negative effects for workers** in the signatory countries. The net outcome depends on the country\u2019s economic structure, the design of the agreement, and the domestic policies that accompany it. Below is a synthesis of the most robust findings from the academic literature, international\u2011organization reports, and case\u2011study evidence, organized by the main channels through which FTAs affect labour markets.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does to workers | Typical empirical pattern |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Market\u2011opening (tariff removal)** | \u2022 Lowers the price of imported goods \u2192 higher real wages for consumers.<br>\u2022 Increases competition for domestic firms \u2192 pressure to cut costs (often labour). | Studies of tariff reductions (e.g., Anderson & van Wincoop 2005; Bown & Irwin 2019) find a modest rise in household real income (\u22480.5\u20112\u202f% per 10\u202f% tariff cut) but a measurable decline in employment in sectors that lose protective tariffs. |\n| **Export\u2011expansion** | \u2022 Expands demand for labour in export\u2011oriented sectors (often manufacturing, services).<br>\u2022 Can raise wages in those sectors if labour is scarce. | The \u201cexport\u2011growth\u201d channel is documented in the US\u2011Mexico NAFTA experience (Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013) and the EU\u2011Eastern Europe enlargement (Eichengreen & Gupta 2015). |\n| **Import\u2011competition** | \u2022 Displaces workers in industries that previously relied on tariff protection (e.g., textiles, apparel, low\u2011skill manufacturing).<br>\u2022 May depress wages in sectors that face strong foreign competition. | Meta\u2011analyses (e.g., Goldberg & Pavcnik 2007; Feenstra & Hanson 1999) estimate that a 10\u202f% rise in import penetration reduces employment in the affected industry by roughly 0.5\u20111\u202f% and lowers average wages by 0.2\u20110.5\u202f%. |\n| **Technology transfer & productivity spill\u2011overs** | \u2022 Introduces new production techniques \u2192 higher productivity, potentially higher wages for skilled workers.<br>\u2022 Can increase demand for higher\u2011skill labour while reducing demand for routine, low\u2011skill labour. | Autor, Levy & Murnane (2003) and the \u201cskill\u2011bias\u201d literature show a consistent shift toward \u201cskill\u2011intensive\u201d tasks after trade liberalisation. |\n| **Regulatory harmonisation (labour, environment, IP)** | \u2022 May raise baseline labour standards if the FTA includes \u201csocial clauses\u201d.<br>\u2022 Conversely, a \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d can occur if standards are weakened to attract investment. | Evidence is mixed. The US\u2011Mexico USMCA\u2019s labour\u2011chapter appears to have modestly improved overtime\u2011pay compliance (Klein & Wang 2022), while the Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (TPP) showed limited impact on overall labour rights (Baker et\u202fal. 2020). |\n| **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) incentives** | \u2022 New plants can create jobs, often in export\u2011oriented sectors.<br>\u2022 Jobs may be \u201clow\u2011skill, low\u2011wage\u201d and temporary. | UNCTAD (2023) reports that FTAs raise FDI inflows by 10\u201130\u202f% on average, but the quality of jobs varies widely across sectors and host\u2011country institutions. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence says \u2013 sectoral and country\u2011level patterns\n\n### 2.1 Developed\u2011country workers (e.g., United States, EU members)\n\n| Finding | Key studies / reports |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| **Manufacturing job losses** \u2013 The United States lost ~2\u20133\u202fmillion manufacturing jobs after NAFTA (1994\u20112008), a decline that is statistically linked to import competition from Mexico (Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013). | Autor, D.H., Dorn, D., & Hanson, G.H. (2013). *The China Shock* (NBER). |\n| **Wage polarization** \u2013 Trade\u2011related import competition is associated with rising earnings at the top and bottom of the wage distribution, but stagnation for middle\u2011skill workers (Goldberg & Pav",
