What the empirical record actually measures  \n\n| **Dimension** | **Typical approach** | **Key limitation** |\n|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Cross\u2011national comparisons** | Compare homicide rates in countries that have DP with those that do not (e.g., United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) data). | Countries differ on many other variables (police capacity, gun prevalence, socioeconomic inequality, legal certainty, reporting standards). |\n| **State\u2011level U.S. studies** | Use panel data on U.S. states over time; exploit \u201cnatural experiments\u201d when a state reinstates, suspends, or abolishes DP. | States also differ in policing, sentencing guidelines, and cultural attitudes; the timing of DP changes is often correlated with other criminal\u2011justice reforms. |\n| **Micro\u2011level (deterrence) experiments** | Survey potential offenders, use \u201cchoice\u2011experiments,\u201d or analyze crime\u2011scene data for \u201cpre\u2011meditation\u201d cues. | Self\u2011report data may not reflect actual behavior; experiments cannot capture the complex decision\u2011making of real offenders. |\n| **Econometric \u201cregression\u2011discontinuity\u201d** | Compare offenders sentenced just above vs. just below the DP threshold (e.g., \u201ccapital\u2011eligible\u201d vs. \u201cnon\u2011capital\u2011eligible\u201d groups). | Small sample sizes; the groups may still differ in unobservable ways (e.g., motive, mental health). |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:** No single design can isolate a pure \u201cDP\u2011vs\u2011LWOP\u201d causal effect. The best evidence comes from converging results across multiple methods, each with its own biases.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The example is useful because:\n\n* New\u202fYork had a long, well\u2011documented death\u2011penalty system (the \u201csecond\u2011degree murder\u201d statute with a capital option) before 2004.  \n* The abolition was a clean legislative cut\u2011off, not a gradual phase\u2011out, which makes it easier to isolate the policy shock.  \n* The state\u2019s homicide\u2011rate reporting is high\u2011quality (NYSDOH, FBI Uniform Crime Reporting) and the period includes several national crime\u2011trend cycles, allowing researchers to control for broader forces.\n\n### 1.  Timeline of the policy change  \n\n| Year | Legal status | Key implementation details |\n|------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **1990\u20112003** | Death penalty **in force** (capital murder \u2192 death or LWOP). | Executions were rare (last execution in 1963), but death sentences were handed down and stayed on the books. |\n| **2004 (March)** | **Abolition** \u2013 \u201cDeath Penalty Repeal Act\u201d (S.\u202f8112). | All existing death\u2011sentence inmates had their sentences commuted to LWOP.

The synthetic control is weighted to match New\u202fYork\u2019s pre\u20112004 homicide trend, demographics, and policing levels.  \n2. **Time\u2011fixed effects** capture nationwide shifts (e.g., the 1994\u20112001 \u201ccrime decline\u201d that many scholars attribute to a mix of policing, demographics, and the economy).  \n3. **Robustness checks**:  \n   * Excluding the first two post\u2011abolition years (to allow for \u201cpolicy lag\u201d).  \n   * Using alternative control groups (e.g., only Northeastern states).  \n   * Adding a \u201cplacebo\u201d test\u2014pretending the law changed in 1999\u2014to verify that no spurious effect appears.\n\n**Result:** The DiD estimate suggests that after the death penalty was removed, New\u202fYork\u2019s homicide rate fell **about 5\u202f% more** than would have been expected given the national trend.

The basic intuition  \n\nImagine you want to know **what would have happened** to New\u202fYork\u2019s homicide rate **if the death penalty had never been abolished**. We can never observe that counterfactual directly, but we can **approximate** it by looking at **other states** that kept the death penalty.  \n\n|                | **Before the policy change** (pre\u20112004) | **After the policy change** (post\u20112004) |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Treated unit** (New\u202fYork) | Homicide rate = **A\u2080** | Homicide rate = **A\u2081** |\n| **Control units** (states that kept DP) | Homicide rate = **B\u2080** | Homicide rate = **B\u2081** |\n\nIf we simply compare the raw change in New\u202fYork (A\u2081\u202f\u2013\u202fA\u2080) we risk attributing any nationwide swing (e.g., the overall 1990s\u20112000s crime decline) to the policy.  \n**DiD** solves this by **subtracting** the change that occurred in the control group:\n\n\\[\n\\text{DiD estimate} \\;=\\; (A_{1}-A_{0}) \\;-\\; (B_{1}-B_{0})\n\\]\n\n- **(A\u2081\u202f\u2013\u202fA\u2080)** = *observed* change in the treated unit.  \n- **(B\u2081\u202f\u2013\u202fB\u2080)** = *estimated* change that would have happened in the treated unit **absent** the policy, because it is the change experienced by similar places that did **not** change their law.  \n\nIf the two groups would have moved in parallel absent the policy (the **parallel\u2011trends assumption**, see below), the difference\u2011in\u2011differences isolates the causal effect of the policy.\n\n### 2.  Formal model  \n\nA common way to write the DiD regression is:\n\n\\[\nY_{it}= \\alpha + \\beta \\, \\text{Post}_{t} + \\gamma \\, \\text{Treated}_{i}\n          + \\delta \\, (\\text{Post}_{t}\\times \\text{Treated}_{i}) + X_{it}\\theta + \\varepsilon_{it}\n\\]\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| \\(Y_{it}\\) | Outcome (e.g., homicide rate) for unit *i* (state, county, etc.) at time *t*. |\n| \\(\\text{Post}_{t}\\) | Indicator = 1 for years **after** the policy change, 0 before. |\n| \\(\\text{Treated}_{i}\\) | Indicator = 1 for the unit that experienced the policy (New\u202fYork), 0 for control units. |\n| \\(\\text{Post}_{t}\\times \\text{Treated}_{i}\\) | Interaction term; its coefficient **\u03b4** is the DiD estimate \u2013 the *additional* change in the treated unit after the policy, beyond any common time trend. |\n| \\(X_{it}\\) | Vector of covariates (unemployment rate, police per capita, gun\u2011ownership prevalence, etc.) that help tighten the estimate. |\n| \\(\\varepsilon_{it}\\) | Error term. |\n\nIf we estimate this with ordinary least squares (OLS) on a panel of states over many years, **\u03b4** tells us the average causal effect of abolishing the death penalty on homicide rates.\n\n### 3.  Why DiD is considered \u201creliable\u201d for policy evaluation  \n\n| **Strength** | **Explanation** |\n|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Controls for unobserved, time\u2011invariant differences** | Any fixed characteristic of a state (e.g., geography, culture, baseline crime propensity) is differenced out because it appears in both the pre\u2011 and post\u2011period for that state. |\n| **Controls for common shocks** | Nationwide events (e.g., a recession, a change in FBI reporting rules) affect *all* states in the same year; they are captured by the \\(\\beta\\) (post) term and thus do not bias the interaction term. |\n| **Transparent identification** | The causal claim rests on a single, testable assumption (parallel trends) that can be examined graphically and statistically. |\n| **Flexibility** | The framework can be extended to multiple treated units, staggered adoption (different states abolish DP at different times), or to allow for heterogeneous",
