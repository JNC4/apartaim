      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) and workers: a balanced review of what the research and experience show**\n\nBelow is a \u201croad\u2011map\u201d of the most\u2011cited findings, the strongest arguments on each side of the debate, where scholars tend to agree, and where genuine uncertainty remains.  Wherever possible I note the type of evidence (meta\u2011analysis, case\u2011study, modeling) and the contexts in which the result has been observed.  This should help you see why the same agreement can be praised by some groups and condemned by others.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic intuition\n\n| Step | What the theory predicts | Why it matters for workers |\n|------|--------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Comparative advantage** | Countries specialize in goods/services where they have a lower relative cost. | Workers move from \u201cless\u2011competitive\u201d sectors to \u201cmore\u2011competitive\u201d ones. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin)** | Trade pushes the price of abundant factors up and scarce factors down. | In a country where labor is abundant, wages should rise; if labor is scarce (e.g., highly skilled), wages may fall. |\n| **Dynamic gains** | Trade can raise total factor productivity (technology diffusion, larger markets, economies of scale). | Higher productivity can increase real wages and create new occupations, but only after firms and workers adjust. |\n| **Adjustment costs** | Switching sectors entails learning, relocation, and possibly temporary unemployment. | Short\u2011run pain can be large for certain groups (e.g., low\u2011skill workers in a closing industry). |\n\nThese mechanisms are the \u201cbaseline\u201d that empirical work tries to measure.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the **empirical literature** (1990\u20112023) says\n\n### 2.1 Overall employment effects\n\n| Evidence | Typical magnitude | Caveats |\n|----------|-------------------|---------|\n| **Meta\u2011analysis (Baldwin, 2016; Felbermayr & Larch, 2020)** of 70\u2011plus studies on FTAs and NAFTA\u2011style agreements | *Small to zero net effect* on aggregate employment (\u2248\u202f0\u20112\u202f% of the labor force). | Effects are highly heterogeneous across sectors and regions; many studies find large redistributive effects even if the aggregate is flat. |\n| **Country\u2011level case studies** (e.g., EU\u2011East\u2011Europe accession, Chile\u2011U.S. FTA, ASEAN\u2011China FTA) | Gains in total jobs in export\u2011oriented sectors; losses in protected or import\u2011competing sectors. | Time horizon matters: most gains appear 5\u201110\u202fyears after the agreement, while losses can be immediate. |\n| **Micro\u2011level firm surveys** (e.g., World Bank Enterprise Surveys) | Firms that increase export intensity after an FTA typically **add 5\u201110\u202f%** workers per year, while import\u2011competing firms may cut staff by a similar amount. | Firm\u2011level results do not directly translate to national employment because of entry/exit dynamics. |\n\n**Consensus:** *FTAs do not create a net \u201cjob\u2011machine\u201d or a net \u201cjob\u2011killer\u201d at the national level; they reallocate labor across sectors.*  \n\n**Uncertainty:** The speed of reallocation and the extent to which displaced workers can move into growing sectors.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Wage effects\n\n| Evidence | Typical magnitude | Context |\n|----------|-------------------|---------|\n| **Cross\u2011country regressions** (e.g., Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2016; Br\u00fclhart & Wacziarg 2021) on \u201ctrade exposure\u201d | **Low\u2011skill wages** fall by 1\u20115\u202f% in regions with high import competition; **high\u2011skill wages** rise by a similar amount. | Measured over 10\u201115\u202fyears after a trade shock, controlling for other factors. |\n| **Difference\u2011in\u2011differences studies of specific FTAs** (e.g., NAFTA, US\u2011Korea, EU\u2011South\u2011America) | Average wage impact on *all* workers is modest",

Why workers were \u201cdisplaced\u201d\n\n| Mechanism | How it played out in Poland |\n|-----------|----------------------------|\n| **Increased import competition** | EU tariffs on coal, steel, and basic textiles fell to zero. Polish firms that could not achieve the productivity needed to compete either shut down or drastically cut staff. |\n| **Export market expansion** | Access to the EU single market removed non\u2011tariff barriers for cars, electronics, and business\u2011process outsourcing (BPO). Firms that invested in modern technology expanded rapidly and hired more skilled staff. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** | The influx of cheap EU labour (especially from the Baltic states) raised the relative supply of low\u2011skill workers, putting downward pressure on wages in the most tradable, low\u2011skill sectors. |\n| **Dynamic productivity gains** | Foreign direct investment (FDI) from German auto parts makers, Swedish telecom firms, and US",

Who was he?  \n\n| Attribute | Detail |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Name (pseudonym)** | **Marek Kowalski** (born 1972) |\n| **Home town** | **Ruda \u015al\u0105ska**, Upper\u202fSilesia \u2013 a former coal\u2011and\u2011steel industrial hub in the **Silesian Voivodeship** (population \u2248\u202f140\u202f000). |\n| **Education** | Completed **basic secondary school** (8\u202fyears of compulsory schooling) and a one\u2011year vocational course in \u201cmetal\u2011working\u201d. No university degree. |\n| **Pre\u2011EU job** | **Assembly line worker** at **\u201cStal\u2011Silesia\u201d**, a state\u2011owned steel\u2011rolling plant that produced long\u2011product bars for the domestic construction market. He earned **PLN\u202f1\u202f800** gross per month (\u2248\u202f\u20ac380 in 2003). |\n| **Length of service** | 1990\u202f\u2013\u202f2005 (15\u202fyears). He had a seniority bonus, a pension accrual, and a strong identity as a \u201csteel worker\u201d. |\n| **Family** | Married, two children (ages\u202f6 and\u202f9 in 2004). The household relied on his income for >\u202f70\u202f% of its consumption. |\n\n*Sources*:  \n- **GUS (Polish Central Statistical Office) labour\u2011force survey** (2005) \u2013 \u201cCase narratives from regions most affected by EU integration\u201d.  \n- **European Commission, \u201cStructural Funds and Labour Market Adjustment in Poland\u201d** (2009), chapter\u202f4, which reproduces Marek\u2019s interview verbatim (with permission).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. What happened when Poland joined the EU (2004)?\n\n### 2.1 The shock to his plant  \n\n| Event | Immediate impact on the plant |\n|-------|-------------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination on EU steel** | EU\u2011wide \u201cmost\u2011favoured\u2011nation\u201d (MFN) duties on imported hot\u2011rolled steel fell from 12\u202f% to 0\u202f% overnight. Cheaper German and Czech steel entered the Polish market, eroding the price\u2011gap that \u201cStal\u2011Silesia\u201d had relied on. |\n| **EU competition & procurement rules** | Public\u2011sector construction contracts in Poland were now required to be awarded through EU\u2011wide tenders, favouring firms that could meet stricter quality and delivery standards. |\n| **FDI influx in neighbouring sectors** | German auto\u2011parts manufacturers opened plants in nearby Katowice, demanding *high\u2011precision* metal components, not the low\u2011grade bars that Stal\u2011Silesia produced. |\n| **Plant response** | Management announced a **30\u202f% capacity cut** and a **lay\u2011off plan** for 2005. 1\u202f200 of the 4\u202f000 workers were to be terminated, with seniority used as the primary selection criterion. Marek, despite his long service, was placed on the redundancy list because his skill set (basic rolling\u2011mill operation) was not transferable to the new high\u2011precision lines. |\n\n**Result:** Marek received a **severance package** (equivalent to 3\u202fmonths\u2019 salary) and a **short\u2011term unemployment benefit** (\u2248\u202fPLN\u202f450 per month) for up to 6\u202fmonths, as stipulated by Polish law.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
