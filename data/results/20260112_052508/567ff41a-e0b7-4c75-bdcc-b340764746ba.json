All three are approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO).  The liquid acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086) is the most common in the United States because it can be pumped directly into the water\u2011treatment line. |\n| 2. **Preparation of a stock solution (if needed)** | For solid agents, the utility dissolves a measured amount in a small volume of water to create a \u201cstock\u201d that can be metered continuously. | Example: 1\u202fkg NaF \u2192 about 4\u202fL of 2\u202f% solution, which can be fed to a dosing pump. |\n| 3. **Metering / dosing** | A calibrated pump injects the fluoridation agent (or stock solution) into the water\u2011treatment process. The pump is usually placed **upstream of the final filtration step** so the fluoride mixes thoroughly with the bulk flow. | \u2022 **Proportional\u2011integral\u2011derivative (PID) controllers** keep the dose constant even when flow rate changes. <br>\u2022 Some utilities use **batch\u2011wise addition** (e.g., a pre\u2011measured drum added to a storage tank) in smaller systems. |\n| 4. **Mixing** | Rapid mixers or simple turbulence in the pipe ensure the fluoride is evenly distributed. | In large plants the residence time before the water leaves the plant is typically 10\u201130\u202fmin, which is ample for complete dissolution. |\n| 5. **Monitoring** | Inline fluorometers (ion\u2011selective electrodes or colorimetric analyzers) continuously measure the fluoride concentration. Samples are also taken daily for laboratory confirmation. | The EPA requires **monthly reporting** of fluoride levels for systems that fluoridate. |\n| 6. **Adjustment** | If the measured concentration drifts, the dosing pump is recalibrated. | Utilities keep a log of flow\u2011rate, dose, and concentration to demonstrate compliance with the target level. |\n\n**Typical target concentrations**\n\n| Region / Agency | Recommended concentration (mg/L) | Rationale |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------|\n| United States (CDC, EPA) | **0.7\u202fmg/L** (0.7\u202fppm) | Chosen as a compromise that maximizes dental\u2011caries prevention while minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis. |\n| Canada (Health Canada) | 0.7\u202fmg/L (optional; many provinces use 0.6\u20130.8\u202fmg/L) | Similar to U.S. guidance. |\n| World Health Organization (WHO) | 0.5\u20131.0\u202fmg/L (optimal range) | Allows adjustment for climate, water consumption, and background fluoride. |\n| European Union (EU) | No EU\u2011wide mandate; many countries set **0.5\u202fmg/L** as a \u201cmaximum permissible level\u201d for natural fluoride, not for intentional fluoridation. | Different public\u2011health policies. |\n\n---\n\n## Safety assessment: What the evidence says\n\n### 1.

Fluorosilicic acid is the most common in the U.S. because it is inexpensive and already produced in large quantities for the fertilizer industry. |\n| **Dosing** | At the treatment plant a **meter\u2011controlled pump** injects a measured amount of the fluoride solution into the water stream.

No special \u201creaction\u201d time is required because the fluoride salts are fully soluble. |\n| **Monitoring** | **Continuous or periodic sampling** (often hourly or every few hours) is done at the plant and at distribution points.
