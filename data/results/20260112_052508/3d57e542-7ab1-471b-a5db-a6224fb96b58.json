Beamforming concentrates energy only when a device is in the beam\u2019s path, and the beam moves rapidly as the device changes location.\n\n---\n\n## Health\u2011effects evidence \u2013 what the science says today\n\n### 1. Type of radiation\n* 5G uses **radio\u2011frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields** (EMF).  \n* RF is **non\u2011ionizing**: photon energies (\u2248\u202f10\u207b\u2075\u202feV) are far below the ~\u202f10\u202feV needed to break chemical bonds or ionize atoms.

When no device is in the beam, the antenna radiates only a very low \u201cidle\u201d level (often a few microwatts). |\n| **Short dwell time** | A beam that points at a phone may stay on that spot for a fraction of a second before steering elsewhere. The average SAR (specific absorption rate) over a minute is therefore tiny. |\n| **High frequency \u2192 rapid attenuation** | mmWave (24\u201140\u202fGHz) is absorbed within a few millimetres of skin; it never penetrates deep tissue, so",

What \u201cbeamforming\u201d actually does \u2013 a plain\u2011language walk\u2011through  \n\n### The ingredients\n| Element | Typical value in a 5\u202fG handset | Why it matters for the network |\n|---------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Carrier frequency** | 3.5\u202fGHz (mid\u2011band) or 28\u202fGHz (mmWave) | Determines how fast the signal spreads and how tightly it can be \u201cfocused\u201d. |\n| **Antenna array in the base\u2011station** | 64\u2011256 tiny radiating elements packed into a panel (\u2248\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fcm for a small cell) | Each element can be driven slightly earlier or later (phase\u2011shifted). |\n| **Signal\u2011processing chip** | Real\u2011time DSP that calculates the optimal phase\u2011shifts for the current user(s) | It knows where the phone is (via timing and angle\u2011of\u2011arrival measurements) and tells each element how to line up its wavefront. |\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step during a video call\n\n| Step | What happens in the network | What you (the user) experience |\n|------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **1. Call set\u2011up** | Your phone sends a short \u201chello\u201d on a **wide\u2011area broadcast** (the antenna radiates a low\u2011power, almost omnidirectional signal). The base\u2011station measures the **time\u2011of\u2011arrival** and **phase\u2011differences** of that signal across its antenna elements. | You see the network indicator change from \u201csearching\u201d to \u201cconnected\u201d. |\n| **2. Location estimate** | From those measurements the system computes a **3\u2011D direction vector** to your phone (think of it as a line pointing from the tower to you). | No perceptible action on your side. |\n| **3. Beam creation** | The DSP tells each antenna element to emit the same 3.5\u202fGHz (or 28\u202fGHz) carrier, but with a tiny timing offset. The offsets cause the individual wavefronts to **add constructively** along the line you\u2019re on and cancel out elsewhere\u2014this is the **beam**. | Your phone now receives a stronger, cleaner signal without you having to do anything. |\n| **4. Data flow** | While you talk and your camera streams video, the base\u2011station continuously **updates** the phase\u2011offsets (typically every few milliseconds) to keep the beam pointed at the moving handset. If you walk a few metres, the beam \u201ctracks\u201d you. | You notice a smooth call; the network may automatically switch to a different cell if you move out of range, but you never see the beam itself. |\n| **5. Return link** | Your phone also has a small antenna array (usually 2\u20114 elements). It does the same thing in reverse: it shapes a narrow beam back toward the tower, so the two\u2011way link is highly directional on both sides. | Again, you just experience a stable connection. |\n| **6. Idle periods** | When you\u2019re not actively transmitting (e.g., you\u2019re listening to the other side), the base\u2011station **reduces** the transmit power dramatically\u2014often to a few microwatts\u2014and the beam may broaden or disappear entirely. | You still see the \u201csignal bars\u201d but the tower is radiating almost nothing. |\n\n#### Why the beam is **safe**\n* **Power is concentrated only where a device is present.** If no phone is in the beam\u2019s path, the antenna\u2019s idle power is orders of magnitude lower than its maximum EIRP.\n* **The beam sweeps past a person in a fraction of a second.** The specific\u2011absorption\u2011rate (SAR) \u2013 the metric used for safety limits \u2013 is averaged over **6\u2011minute** intervals. A sub\u2011second exposure that is a few\u2011times higher than the idle level still averages out to well below the limit.\n* **The beam\u2019s width is narrow.** At 3.5\u202fGHz a typical massive\u2011MIMO array can produce a beam about 10\u201320\u00b0 wide; at 28\u202fGHz the beam can be <\u202f5\u00b0. That means the high\u2011intensity zone is roughly the size of a human head, not a whole room.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Simple, evidence\u2011based ways to keep personal RF exposure as low as you feel comfortable  \n\n| Action | How it works | Approximate effect on exposure | Practicality / notes |\n|--------|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Keep the phone a short distance from your body**",
