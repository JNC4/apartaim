The evidence is mixed, and the size and direction of the impact depend on the country\u2019s institutions, the industries that are opened to competition, the skill composition of the labour force, and the policy response that accompanies the trade liberalisation.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Theoretical baseline\n\n| Theory | Predicted effect on workers | Key assumptions |\n|--------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Comparative\u2011advantage / Heckscher\u2011Ohlin** | Workers move from sectors where the country has a *relative disadvantage* to sectors where it has a *relative advantage*. Aggregate real wages rise because the economy can produce more goods with the same resources. | Perfect competition, full mobility of labour and capital, no adjustment costs. |\n| **Specific\u2011factor (Stolper\u2011Samuelson) theorem** | Trade\u2011exposed *low\u2011skill* workers can lose (their factor price falls) while *high\u2011skill* workers gain (their factor price rises). | Two\u2011good, two\u2011factor world; factor immobility across sectors. |\n| **New\u2011trade\u2011theory (e.g., Melitz 2003)** | Only the most productive firms enter export markets; less\u2011productive firms may exit, causing *reallocation* of workers to more productive firms. Net effect on wages is positive for workers who can move, but *displaced* workers may suffer short\u2011run losses. | Firm heterogeneity, costly entry/exit, frictionless labour markets. |\n| **Political\u2011economy / \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d** | FTAs may pressure governments to lower labour standards or wages to stay competitive. | Weak institutions, limited bargaining power. |\n\n*Take\u2011away*: The baseline models agree that trade creates **gains in total surplus**, but they differ on **who gains and who loses** and on the **speed of adjustment**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Workers in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011skill or capital\u2011intensive sectors usually see higher wages and more jobs, while workers in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill or labor\u2011intensive industries often experience job losses or slower wage growth.
