Health effects are dominated by radiation exposure, mainly thyroid cancer in children; overall excess mortality is small relative to the size of the electricity output. | No single \u201ccatastrophic\u201d event, but chronic exposure to pollutants causes millions of premature deaths each year. |\n| **Fuel cycle waste** | Radioactive waste is long\u2011lived but is managed in secure, isolated facilities; no direct mortality observed from waste handling. | Coal ash contains heavy metals (arsenic, lead, selenium) that can contaminate water and soil; epidemiological links to cancer and kidney disease have been documented in communities near disposal sites. |\n\nBecause the two technologies differ so much in how they affect health, researchers usually express **death rates in \u201cdeaths per terawatt\u2011hour (TWh) of electricity generated\u201d** (or per gigawatt\u2011year, GW\u00b7yr). This normalises the numbers to the amount of useful energy supplied, allowing a direct comparison.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most widely cited quantitative estimates, followed by a discussion of the underlying evidence, uncertainties, and where the debate still exists.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Indirect climate\u2011change mortality** (long\u2011term) | Coal\u2011combustion CO\u2082 drives climate change, which in turn contributes to heat\u2011wave deaths, vector\u2011borne disease, sea\u2011level\u2011rise displacement, etc. This is a *very long\u2011term* effect and is **usually omitted** from short\u2011term life\u2011cycle assessments, but some integrated\u2011assessment studies (e.g., IPCC AR6) add a small \u201cclimate\u2011change\u201d term. | \u2022 IPCC AR6 Chapter\u202f2 \u2013 ~0.2\u202fdeaths/TWh from climate\u2011change pathways (high\u2011end). | **\u2248\u202f1\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f0.2\u202fdeaths/TWh) |\n| **5.
