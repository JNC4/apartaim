Definitions (to keep the terms clear)\n\n| Term | What it means | Typical processing steps |\n|------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| **Raw milk** | Milk taken directly from a lactating animal (cow, goat, sheep, etc.) and consumed without any heat treatment. | No pasteurization, UHT, or other thermal kill step. May be filtered to remove large particles but not heated. |\n| **Pasteurized milk** | Milk that has been heated to a specific temperature\u2011time combination designed to destroy pathogenic microorganisms while retaining most of the milk\u2019s nutritional and sensory qualities. | Common regimes: <br>\u2022 **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** \u2013 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin (the \u201cbatch\u201d method). <br>\u2022 **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (the most common commercial method). <br>\u2022 **Ultra\u2011high temperature (UHT)** \u2013 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (produces shelf\u2011stable milk). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence tells us about **food\u2011borne illness risk**\n\n| Pathogen | Presence in raw milk (studies) | Effect of pasteurization | Reported outbreak data (U.S. & EU) |\n|----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **_Campylobacter jejuni_** | Frequently isolated from raw cow milk (up to 30\u202f% of samples in some farm\u2011level surveys). | Heat\u2011sensitive; killed at \u2265\u202f55\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fmin. | 73\u202f% of U.S. raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks (1993\u20112022) listed Campylobacter as the primary agent (CDC). |\n| **_Salmonella spp._** | Detected in 2\u201110\u202f% of raw milk samples in many national surveys. | Inactivated at \u2265\u202f72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (HTST). | 15\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks in the EU (2010\u20112022) involved Salmonella. |\n| **_Escherichia coli_ (pathogenic STEC, O157:H7, etc.)** | STEC found in 1\u20115\u202f% of raw milk samples in high\u2011risk farms. | Destroyed at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs. | 8\u202f% of U.S. raw\u2011milk outbreaks; STEC is the leading cause of hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome in children linked to raw milk. |\n| **_Listeria monocytogenes_** | Can survive and even grow at refrigeration temperatures; isolated from raw milk in 1\u20113\u202f% of samples. | Killed at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs; however, post\u2011pasteurization re\u2011contamination can occur. | Rare in outbreaks, but cases of invasive listeriosis have been traced to contaminated raw milk. |\n| **_Mycobacterium bovis_** (bovine TB) | Historically a concern; now rare in most industrialized nations but still present in some small\u2011holder herds. | Inactivated at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs. | Very few modern outbreaks, but historic data show severe disease in humans. |\n| **_Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions_** | Not a bacterial pathogen; prions are heat\u2011stable. | Pasteurization does **not** inactivate prions, but the risk of BSE transmission through milk is considered **negligible** because the prion is not shed in milk in detectable amounts. | No documented human cases linked to milk. |\n\n### Quantitative risk estimates (meta\u2011analyses)\n\n| Study | Region | Method | Estimated risk of illness per 10,000 servings | Comment |\n|-------|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------|---------|\n| **K.
