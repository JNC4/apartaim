No deliberate heating step. | Milk is heated to a specific temperature for a set time (e.g., 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201chigh\u2011temperature short\u2011time\u201d (HTST) \u2013 or 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin \u2013 \u201clow\u2011temperature long\u2011time\u201d (LTLT)) and then rapidly cooled. |\n| **Typical microbial load** | 10\u2011100\u202f\u00d7 higher total bacterial count than pasteurised milk.  The flora includes both harmless \u201cenvironmental\u201d bacteria and, in a minority of cases, disease\u2011causing pathogens. | Bacterial count is reduced by 5\u20117 log\u202f(99.999\u202f%+).  Most pathogenic bacteria are eliminated; only heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Bacillus* spp.) may remain, but they are rarely a health problem in the final product. |\n| **Pathogens that can be present** | \u2022 *Salmonella* spp.  <br>\u2022 *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 and other Shiga\u2011toxin producers  <br>\u2022 *Listeria monocytogenes*  <br>\u2022 *Campylobacter* spp.  <br>\u2022 *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin\u2011producing strains)  <br>\u2022 *Mycobacterium bovis* (rare in many countries) | The standard pasteurisation process kills >99.99\u202f% of the above organisms.  Outbreaks linked to pasteurised milk are extremely rare; when they occur they are usually due to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination (e.g., dirty equipment). |\n| **Evidence of illness** | \u2022 In the United States, the CDC records ~130\u2011150 outbreaks per year linked to raw milk, causing ~2\u202f000 illnesses, 200 hospitalisations and 5\u201110 deaths (2007\u20112022 data).  <br>\u2022 In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) estimates ~30\u202f% of all milk\u2011related outbreaks involve raw milk, with higher rates in countries where it is sold legally. | \u2022 Outbreaks from pasteurised milk are <1\u202f% of all milk\u2011related outbreaks in the same period.  <br>\u2022 Most cases are traced to post\u2011process contamination rather than failure of the heat step. |\n| **Regulatory stance** | \u2022 In many jurisdictions (e.g., most of the EU, Canada, Australia) raw milk is illegal for sale to the public.  <br>\u2022 In the U.S. it is legal in ~30\u202f% of states, often with strict lab\u2011testing and labelling requirements. | \u2022 Universally permitted; required by law in virtually every country that sells milk for human consumption. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme claims** | \u2022 Raw milk retains heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, some B\u2011vitamins) and enzymes (lipase, phosphatase) that are partially destroyed by pasteurisation.  <br>\u2022 The absolute differences are modest (\u226410\u201115\u202f% for most nutrients) and can be compensated by a balanced diet. | \u2022 Slight loss of certain heat\u2011labile nutrients, but the overall nutritional profile (protein, calcium, fat, most vitamins) is essentially unchanged. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | 5\u20117\u202fdays under refrigeration (if kept cold from milking).  Faster spoilage because of higher bacterial load. | 14\u201121\u202fdays (or longer with ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) processing).  Lower risk of spoilage. |\n| **Risk mitigation** | \u2022 Requires rigorous on\u2011farm hygiene, rapid cooling, and frequent microbiological testing (often mandated by state law).  <br>\u2022 Even with best practices, occasional pathogen presence is documented. | \u2022 Pasteurisation is a validated, repeatable kill step.  Additional safety comes from cold\u2011chain control and sanitary handling after the heat step. |\n\n---\n\n### What the scientific consensus says\n\n* **Public\u2011health agencies** (U.S. CDC, FDA, European Food Safety Authority, World Health Organization) *strongly* recommend pasteurised milk for the general population.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \n- **Pasteurised milk** \u2013\u202fthe heat\u2011treatment step (usually 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs or 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin) kills virtually all pathogenic bacteria that may be present in raw milk.  Outbreaks of food\u2011borne illness from pasteurised milk are rare, and when they do occur they are almost always traceable to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination or to a failure of the pasteurisation process.  \n- **Raw milk** \u2013\u202fun\u2011heated milk can contain the same pathogens that pasteurisation is designed to destroy (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*).  Even on farms that follow \u201cbest\u2011practice\u201d hygiene, surveys find measurable levels of these organisms.

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1. A concrete, well\u2011documented outbreak  \n\n**Outbreak:** *Campylobacter jejuni* infection linked to raw milk from a farm in Pennsylvania, USA (2012)\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Who was affected?** | 9 people (7 children, 2 adults) who drank raw milk from a single dairy farm. |\n| **How was the outbreak discovered?** | Local health departments noticed an unusual cluster of gastro\u2011intestinal illness. Stool cultures from the patients grew *Campylobacter jejuni*. An epidemiological interview revealed that all had consumed raw milk from the same source in the week before falling ill. |\n| **Laboratory evidence** | The *Campylobacter* strain isolated from the patients was identical (by pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis) to the strain recovered from a bulk\u2011tank sample of the farm\u2019s raw milk. |\n| **Clinical outcome** | All cases experienced diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and vomiting. Two children were hospitalized for dehydration; none required intensive care and there were no deaths. |\n| **Regulatory response** | \u2022 The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture issued a **temporary suspension of milk sales** from the farm while a corrective\u2011action plan was developed. <br>\u2022 The farm was required to implement a **comprehensive HACCP\u2011type plan**, increase on\u2011farm hygiene, and submit **monthly microbiological test results** (total plate count, coliforms, and *Campylobacter* testing). <br>\u2022 The state also mandated that the farm **post a warning label** on every container stating \u201cRaw milk may contain harmful bacteria.\u201d |\n| **Long\u2011term impact** | The farm ultimately chose to **switch to pasteurisation** for its commercial milk line, citing the cost of the required testing program and the desire to protect its reputation. The outbreak was cited in a 2013 CDC report as one of the \u201ctop 5 raw\u2011milk outbreaks in the United States (2007\u20112012).\u201d |\n\n*Key take\u2011away*: Even on a farm that follows good\u2011hand\u2011milking practices, a single lapse (e.g., contaminated milking equipment, a sick animal, or inadequate cooling) can introduce a pathogen that quickly spreads to every consumer of that bulk product.\n\n---\n\n## 2. \u201cCan I drink raw milk safely?\u201d \u2013 Practical steps for the consumer  \n\n> **Bottom line:** The only way to *guarantee* safety is to consume milk that has been pasteurised (or boiled) yourself.  If you decide to drink raw milk despite the risk, the steps below can *reduce*\u2014but not eliminate\u2014the chance of illness.\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it matters |\n|------|------------|----------------|\n| **1. Choose a reputable source** | \u2022 Buy only from a **licensed dairy** that subjects its herd to regular veterinary health checks (including testing for *Brucella*, *TB*, and mastitis). <br>\u2022 Look for farms that publish **annual microbiological test results** (total plate count, coliforms, *E.\u202fcoli*, *Listeria*, *Salmonella*). | The herd health and on\u2011farm testing record are the strongest predictors of low pathogen load. |\n| **2. Verify the cold chain** | \u2022 Milk should be harvested and stored at **\u22644\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F)** from the moment it leaves the cow until you open it. <br>\u2022 Transport the product in an insulated cooler with ice packs if you cannot get home quickly. | Pathogenic bacteria multiply rapidly between 4\u201312\u202f\u00b0C; a broken cold chain can turn a low\u2011level contamination into a large inoculum. |\n| **3. Check the \u201csell\u2011by\u201d date and appearance** | \u2022 Use the milk *within* the date printed on the container. <br>\u2022 Look for off\u2011odors, curdling, or excessive foam\u2014signs that spoilage bacteria have taken hold. | Even with good hygiene, raw milk has a short shelf\u2011life; spoilage is a warning sign that bacterial counts are high. |\n| **4. Do a simple home test (optional)** | \u2022 **Coliform test strips** (available from farm\u2011supply stores) can give a quick indication of fecal contamination. <br>\u2022 A negative result is reassuring but **not a guarantee**\u2014many pathogens are not coliforms. | Provides an extra layer of information, especially if you are buying from a small farm that does not publish lab results. |\n| **5.
