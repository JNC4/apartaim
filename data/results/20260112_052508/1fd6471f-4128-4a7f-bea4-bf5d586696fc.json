      "unknown_model_response": "**Why doctors (and public\u2011health agencies) recommend childhood vaccination**\n\n| Reason | What it means for a child and for society | Key evidence |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Direct protection against serious disease** | Vaccines train the immune system to recognise and fight the germs that cause illnesses such as measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, rotavirus, hepatitis\u202fB, HPV, etc.  The result is far fewer cases, hospitalisations and deaths. | In the United States, the 2019\u20132020\u202fCDC \u201cVaccines for Children\u201d report estimated that routine childhood vaccines prevented\u202f\u2248\u202f42\u202fmillion illnesses, 20\u202fmillion medical visits, 600\u202f000 hospitalisations and 12\u202f000 deaths each birth\u2011cohort year. |\n| **Prevention of complications and long\u2011term disability** | Many vaccine\u2011preventable diseases can cause permanent damage (e.g., brain injury from measles encephalitis, paralysis from polio, hearing loss from meningitis, chronic liver disease from hepatitis\u202fB, infertility from untreated gonorrhoea). Vaccination stops those sequelae before they start. | A 2020 systematic review in *The Lancet* found that measles can cause encephalitis in 1\u202fin\u202f1\u202f000 cases and death in 1\u20132\u202fper\u202f1\u202f000; the same review noted that the measles vaccine prevents >99\u202f% of cases. |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | When a high proportion of people are immune, the pathogen has few susceptible hosts, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants too young for certain shots, people with immune\u2011suppression, or those with contraindications). | The threshold for measles herd immunity is \u2248\u202f95\u202f% coverage; when coverage fell below that in Europe in 2018\u20112019, measles cases surged >\u202f300\u202f%. |\n| **Eradication and control of diseases** | Widespread vaccination has eliminated smallpox globally, nearly eradicated polio, and dramatically reduced diseases like diphtheria, rubella, and Haemophilus\u202finfluenzae type\u202fb (Hib). | WHO reports that global polio cases dropped from ~350\u202f000 in 1999 to <\u202f100\u202fin 2023. |\n| **Economic and social benefits** | Fewer sick days for children and parents, lower health\u2011care costs, and better school attendance and performance. | The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) estimates that every dollar spent on childhood vaccination saves about\u202f$3\u202fin direct medical costs and\u202f$10\u202fin societal costs. |\n| **Safety of the child\u2019s future health** | Some diseases (e.g., HPV) are linked to cancers that develop decades later; vaccinating early prevents those outcomes before any exposure occurs. | A 2022 meta\u2011analysis in *JAMA Oncology* showed that the HPV vaccine reduces the incidence of cervical precancers by >\u202f90\u202f% within 5\u202fyears of vaccination. |\n\n---\n\n**How safe are childhood vaccines?**\n\n1. **Rigorous development and approval process**  \n   *Pre\u2011clinical* studies (cell cultures, animal models) \u2192 *Phase\u202fI* (small group, safety) \u2192 *Phase\u202fII* (dose\u2011finding, expanded safety) \u2192 *Phase\u202fIII* (thousands of participants, efficacy & safety).  \n   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other regulators require that a vaccine\u2019s benefits clearly outweigh its risks before licensure.\n\n2. **Post\u2011licensure monitoring**  \n   *Passive* systems (e.g., VAERS in the U.S., Yellow Card in the U.K.) collect any reported adverse event.  \n   *Active* surveillance (CDC\u2019s VSD, FDA\u2019s Sentinel, WHO\u2019s Global Vaccine Safety Initiative) follows millions of vaccine recipients in real time to detect rare signals.  \n   The combined systems have identified only a handful of true safety concerns (e.g., rare anaphylaxis, Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome after certain flu vaccines, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after the Janssen COVID\u201119 vaccine) and have led to updated recommendations when needed.\n\n3. **Common, mild side\u2011effects**  \n   *Local*: pain, redness, swelling at the injection site \u2013 occurs in",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case: **Intussusception after the first rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield)**  \n\n| **What happened?** | **How it was discovered?** | **What actions were taken?** | **What do we know now?** |\n|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Intussusception** is a rare, acute\u2011onset bowel obstruction where a segment of the intestine \u201ctelescopes\u201d into an adjacent segment. It can cause severe abdominal pain, vomiting and, if untreated, intestinal damage. In 1998\u20111999, after the licensure of **RotaShield** (the first rotavirus vaccine approved in the United States), a small increase in intussusception cases was observed in vaccinated infants. | \u2022 **Passive reporting:** The U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) received a handful of intussusception reports within weeks of vaccine rollout.  <br>\u2022 **Active surveillance:** The CDC\u2019s **Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)**, which links vaccination records to health\u2011care claims for >\u202f9\u202fmillion people, performed a rapid\u2011cycle analysis. By comparing the rate of intussusception in the 7\u2011day risk window after vaccination to the background rate, VSD identified a **statistically significant 3\u2011 to 4\u2011fold increase** (\u2248\u202f1 extra case per 10\u202f000\u201120\u202f000 doses). | 1. **Immediate suspension** \u2013 In August\u202f1999, the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew RotaShield from the market, and the CDC halted its use. <br>2. **Label and guidance updates** \u2013 The FDA required a **black\u2011box warning** (the strongest warning label) for any future rotavirus vaccine, mandating that manufacturers conduct large pre\u2011licensure safety trials specifically powered to detect intussusception. <br>3. **Policy change** \u2013 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that any new rotavirus vaccine be given **only after the infant is \u2265\u202f6\u202fweeks old** (the age at which the baseline risk of intussusception begins to rise) and that the **first dose be administered before 15\u202fweeks**. <br>4. **Enhanced post\u2011licensure monitoring** \u2013 When the newer vaccines (RotaTeq\u00ae and Rotarix\u00ae) entered the market in 2006, the CDC instituted **mandatory active surveillance** for intussusception for the first two years of each product\u2019s use, using VSD, the **Post\u2011Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM)** network, and the **World Health Organization\u2019s Global Rotavirus Surveillance** platform. | \u2022 The newer, currently used rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq\u00ae, Rotarix\u00ae, and the newer *RV5* formulation) have **been studied in trials involving >\u202f60\u202f000 infants** and in >\u202f30\u202fmillion doses administered worldwide.  <br>\u2022 The pooled data show a **small excess risk** of about **1\u20132 additional intussusception cases per 100\u202f000 vaccinated infants** \u2013 roughly **1 case per 50\u202f000\u2013100\u202f000 doses**.  <br>\u2022 The **benefit\u2013risk balance** remains overwhelmingly favorable: each dose prevents ~**5,000\u201310,000 hospitalizations** for severe rotavirus gastroenteritis and dozens of deaths, while causing at most a handful of intussusception cases that are **treatable** when recognized early.  <br>\u2022 Health\u2011care providers are now trained to recognize the classic symptoms (sudden abdominal pain, vomiting, \u201ccurrant\u2011jelly\u201d stools) within the first week after vaccination, and prompt imaging (ultrasound) and non\u2011surgical reduction (air enema) are highly successful (>\u202f95\u202f% success). |\n\n---\n\n#### Why this example matters\n\n1. **Speed of detection** \u2013 The combined passive (VAERS) and active (VSD) systems identified the signal within months, far faster than would be possible with only pre\u2011licensure data.\n2. **Transparent response** \u2013 The manufacturer\u2019s withdrawal, the FDA\u2019s label change, and the ACIP\u2019s revised schedule were all publicly announced, with clear explanations of the absolute risk.\n3. **Improved safeguards** \u2013 Modern rotavirus vaccines are now launched with **larg",
