Cooking methods that **lower the formation of carcinogenic compounds**  \n\n### Why cooking matters  \n\n- **Heme iron** (naturally present in red meat) can catalyse the formation of *N\u2011nitroso compounds* (NOCs) in the gut.  \n- **High\u2011temperature, dry\u2011heat cooking** (grilling, barbecuing, pan\u2011frying, broiling) creates **heterocyclic amines (HCAs)** and **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)**, both shown in animal and cell\u2011culture studies to damage DNA.  \n- The **amount** of HCAs/PAHs rises steeply above **150\u202f\u00b0C (300\u202f\u00b0F)** and with longer cooking times or heavy charring.\n\n### Evidence\u2011based cooking strategies  \n\n| Strategy | How it works & evidence | Practical tips |\n|----------|------------------------|----------------|\n| **Trim visible",

Prep the steak** | Pat dry with paper towels. Lightly season with salt (and pepper/herbs if you like). | \u2013 | Dry surface helps the final sear, but because the meat spends most of its time **below 60\u202f\u00b0C**, HCAs/PAHs are not generated. |\n| **2. Bag it** | Place the steak in a vacuum bag (or zip\u2011bag, removing as much air as possible). Add a sprig of thyme/rosemary if desired. | \u2013 | No added fat or sugars that could burn. |\n| **3. Sous\u2011vide** | Submerge the sealed bag in a water bath set to **55\u202f\u00b0C (131\u202f\u00b0F)** for **1\u202fhour** (1\u202finch steak) \u2013 1\u202f\u00bd\u202fh for a thicker cut. | 55\u202f\u00b0C (131\u202f\u00b0F) constant | Cooking is **well below the >\u202f150\u202f\u00b0C threshold** where HCAs form. The meat cooks evenly, so you never need to over\u2011cook any part. |\n| **4. Remove & dry** | Take the steak out, discard the bag, and **pat it completely dry** with paper towels. | \u2013 | Moisture removal prevents steam\u2011bubbling during the sear, which would otherwise cause uneven high\u2011heat spots. |\n| **5. Quick sear** | Heat a skillet on **high** for ~30\u202fseconds, add **1\u202ftsp oil**, then place the steak in the pan.

Studies in *Meat Science* (2020; 161:108030) found **<\u202f5\u202f%** of the HCAs that appear when the same cut is grilled. |\n| **Finish quickly on a hot skillet or grill (\u2264\u202f2\u202fmin per side)** | A brief, high\u2011heat sear creates a tasty Maillard crust **without** giving the meat enough time to generate large amounts of HCAs/PAHs. The \u201cflash\u2011sear\u201d technique keeps the interior at the sous\u2011vide temperature while limiting surface charring. |\n| **Avoid heavy charring** \u2013 scrape off any blackened bits before eating | Charred bits are the densest sources of PAHs. Removing them cuts the intake of these compounds almost to zero. |\n| **Serve with a plant\u2011rich side (e.g., steamed broccoli, salad with olive oil)** | Fiber and antioxidants from vegetables can bind to any residual N\u2011nitroso compounds in the gut, reducing their absorption (observational data from the EPIC cohort, 2021). |\n\n### Full recipe (\u2248\u202f70\u202fg cooked steak, one serving)\n\n| Item | Amount | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| **Beef strip\u2011loin or sirloin steak** (raw) | **100\u202fg (\u2248\u202f3.5\u202foz) raw** | Raw weight is a convenient supermarket measurement; after cooking it will shrink ~30\u202f% to \u2248\u202f70\u202fg cooked. |\n| **Marinade** | 1\u202fTbsp olive oil, 1\u202fTbsp lemon juice, \u00bd\u202ftsp minced garlic, \u00bd\u202ftsp fresh rosemary (or \u00bc\u202ftsp dried), pinch of black pepper, pinch of sea salt | Mix, coat the steak, refrigerate **\u2265\u202f30\u202fmin** (longer (up to 12\u202fh) is fine). |\n| **Sous\u2011vide bag** | Vacuum\u2011seal the marinated steak (or use a zip\u2011lock with water\u2011displacement method). | |\n| **Water\u2011bath** | Set immersion circulator to **58\u202f\u00b0C (136\u202f\u00b0F)** for medium\u2011rare (adjust to 55\u202f\u00b0C for rare, 60\u202f\u00b0C for medium). | Cook **1\u202fh** for a 2\u2011cm\u2011thick steak; up to 2\u202fh if you like it ultra\u2011tender. |\n| **Finish** | Heat a cast\u2011iron skillet until just smoking, add a tiny splash of oil, sear **45\u202fs each side**. | No need to add butter or extra oil; the steak already has a thin layer of fat from the marinate. |\n| **Rest** | Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with foil, rest **3\u202fmin**. | Resting lets juices redistribute; it does not increase HCA formation. |\n| **Serve** | Pair with **\u2265\u202f\u00bd\u202fcup (\u2248\u202f80\u202fg) steamed vegetables** or a mixed green salad. | Adding fiber is optional but recommended for overall health. |\n\n**Result:** A juicy, medium\u2011rare steak with a flavorful herb\u2011citrus crust, cooked at low temperature for most of the time, and with virtually no blackened char. The total HCA/PAH load is estimated to be **<",
