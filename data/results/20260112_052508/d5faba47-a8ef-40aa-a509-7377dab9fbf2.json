How QE changes the mortgage market\n\n### 2.1 The mechanism\n* The Fed announces a QE round and buys a large amount of Treasury and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS).  \n* Prices of those securities rise \u2192 yields (the effective interest rate on new MBS) fall.  \n* Because new mortgages are priced off the same Treasury\u2011plus\u2011spread, **new loan rates drop**.  \n* Existing fixed\u2011rate borrowers do **not** see a lower payment, but the family can refinance at the lower rate.\n\n### 2.2 Empirical magnitude\n* **Fed research (2020)** finds that each $1\u202ftrillion of QE reduces the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield by about 7\u201310\u202fbasis points (bp).  \n* The *spread* between Treasury yields and new mortgage rates has historically been ~150\u2013180\u202fbp.  \n* In the QE rounds of 2020\u20112021, the average **new 30\u2011yr mortgage rate fell from \u22485.0\u202f% to \u22483.0\u202f%**, i.e., a **\u2248200\u2011bp reduction** (see Federal Reserve Economic Data, \u201c30\u2011Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average\u201d).  \n\n**Assumption for this example:** the family can refinance at **3.0\u202f%** (the rate prevailing a few months after QE starts) and the bank waives the typical 0.5\u202f% refinancing fee because of a \u201clow\u2011cost refinancing\u201d promotion that often accompanies QE.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Interest\u2011rate / yield\u2011curve channel** | Large\u2011scale purchases of long\u2011dated Treasuries (and sometimes agency MBS). | Long\u2011term government yields fall \u2192 yields on all \u201crisk\u2011free\u201d assets (savings accounts, Treasury\u2011bond funds, CDs) drop. | \u2022\u202fU.S. QE (2008\u20112014) cut the 10\u2011y Treasury from \u2248\u202f3.5\u202f% to \u2248\u202f1.5\u202f% (\u2248\u202f\u20112\u202fpp). <br>\u2022\u202fAverage APY on high\u2011yield online savings fell from \u2248\u202f0.80\u202f% (pre\u2011QE) to \u2248\u202f0.30\u202f% (mid\u2011QE) (FDIC data, 2009\u20112013). |\n| **2. Asset\u2011price / wealth channel** | By raising bond prices, QE pushes investors into riskier assets \u2192 equity valuations rise; also lifts housing prices, which feed into corporate balance sheets. | Stock market indexes gain **extra** points that would not have occurred without QE. | \u2022\u202fGagnon et\u202fal., 2011 (Fed) estimate QE added **\u2248\u202f4\u20115\u202f%** to U.S. S&P\u202f500 total\u2011return over 2009\u20112014. <br>\u2022\u202fBorio & Zabai (2020) find a **\u2248\u202f1.5\u202f%\u20112\u202f%** upward bias in 10\u2011y Treasury yields, which translates into a **\u2248\u202f7\u202f%** boost to U.S. house\u2011price growth. |\n| **3. Inflation\u2011expectations channel** | QE expands the monetary base, which can raise expected inflation. | Fixed\u2011rate debt (mortgages, Treasury bonds) becomes cheaper in real terms; nominal returns",
