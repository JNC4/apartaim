      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer** \u2013  The average\u2011country\u2011level impact of a free\u2011trade agreement (FTA) on *overall* wages and *overall* job\u2011security is modest, but the distribution of those effects is far from uniform.  In most studies the net\u2011wage change for a whole economy is close to zero (\u00b1\u202f1\u20112\u202f% over a decade), while *some* workers gain higher pay and more secure employment and *others* lose both.  The size and direction of the effect depend on:\n\n* the country\u2019s level of development and its factor\u2011endowments (skill\u2011intensive vs. labor\u2011intensive);  \n* the sectoral composition of its economy (export\u2011oriented manufacturing vs. services vs. agriculture);  \n* the strength of labor\u2011market institutions (minimum\u2011wage laws, unemployment insurance, active\u2011labour\u2011market programmes); and  \n* the design of the FTA itself (coverage of services, rules\u2011of\u2011origin, labour\u2011standards chapters).\n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based synthesis of what scholars, international organisations, and policy\u2011analysis groups have found.  I separate **consensus findings** (where most credible research agrees) from **areas of genuine debate or uncertainty**, and I highlight evidence that is often under\u2011cited.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Quick snapshot of the result  \n\n| Dimension | What the evidence most often reports for low\u2011skill U.S. workers (\u2248\u202fhigh\u2011school diploma or less, many in manufacturing and low\u2011wage services) |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Real wages (1994\u20112014)** | \u2022 **Stagnation or modest decline** relative to the pre\u2011NAFTA trend \u2013 about **\u20110.4\u202f% per year** on average across the whole low\u2011skill cohort (see Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013; Autor & Dorn 2013). |\n| **Employment / job security** | \u2022 **Net job loss** in the most exposed manufacturing subsectors (e.g., apparel, textiles, furniture, certain auto parts) \u2013 roughly **0.5\u202f% of total employment** in those industries per year, concentrated in the **South\u2011Central** states (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, etc.). <br>\u2022 **Higher turnover**: workers displaced were on average **4\u20136\u202fmonths** longer between jobs than comparable workers in non\u2011exposed industries. |\n| **Geographic concentration** | \u2022 The negative effects were **highly localized**: the \u201ctreatment\u201d counties (those with a high share of NAFTA\u2011exposed jobs) lost **~2\u20133\u202f% of total employment** over the first decade, while counties with little exposure actually **gained** a few percent. |\n| **Long\u2011run adjustment** | \u2022 By the end of the 2010s, many of the displaced workers had **re\u2011entered the labor market** in lower\u2011paying service jobs (retail, food service, health\u2011care support).  Overall **average hourly earnings** for the low\u2011skill group were still **\u2248\u202f5\u202f% lower** than they would have been under a \u201cno\u2011NAFTA\u201d counterfactual (based on synthetic\u2011control estimates). |\n\n> **Bottom line:** In the United States, NAFTA **did not raise wages or job security for low\u2011skill workers** on average; instead it produced modest wage stagnation and a measurable loss of manufacturing jobs in the most exposed regions. The aggregate U.S. labor market still grew (thanks to services and high\u2011skill sectors), but the gains were **unevenly distributed**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How researchers measured \u201cexposure\u201d and why that matters  \n\n| Step | What was done | Why it matters for low\u2011skill workers |\n|------|---------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Define exposure** | Count of **import\u2011competing jobs** in a county/industry that would be directly affected by a 10\u202f% tariff reduction on NAFTA partners (the \u201ctreatment intensity\u201d).  Sources: 1990 Census of Employment, BEA industry data. | Low\u2011skill workers are over\u2011represented in those jobs (e.g., apparel, textiles, certain auto\u2011parts).  The exposure metric isolates the **trade channel** from other macro\u2011economic forces. |\n| **Construct a counterfactual** | Use a **difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** design: compare employment and wage trends in high\u2011exposure counties to low\u2011exposure counties before and after NAFTA\u2019s 1994 implementation.  Some papers (e.g., Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013) also add a **synthetic\u2011control** for each state. | The method assumes that, absent NAFTA, the two groups would have followed parallel trends.  This is plausible for low\u2011skill workers because the main driver of divergence was the tariff cut, not a state\u2011specific policy shock. |\n| **Control for other shocks** | Include variables for **state\u2011level minimum\u2011wage changes, welfare reforms, automation indices, and oil\u2011price shocks**. | Low\u2011skill workers are also sensitive to automation and welfare policy; controlling for them isolates the *trade* effect. |\n| **Look at heterogeneity** |",
