      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that aim to change a target country\u2019s behavior by creating economic pain or inconvenience.**  \nWhether they succeed, fail, or produce mixed outcomes depends on a host of political, economic, and strategic factors. Below is a synthesis of the most\u2011cited research, the main mechanisms through which sanctions operate, and the conditions that tend to shape their effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The basic logic of sanctions  \n\n| Step | What the sanction does | Intended effect |\n|------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Cost\u2011imposition** | Cuts off trade, finance, investment, or specific goods (e.g., oil, technology). | Raises the economic cost of the target\u2019s current policy. |\n| **Incentive creation** | Makes the status\u2011quo more costly than the policy change. | Gives the target a *price* for compliance. |\n| **Signal & isolation** | Publicly condemns the target and signals that the international community is united. | Raises the political cost of defiance and can encourage \u201caudience\u2011cost\u201d pressure on leaders. |\n| **Domestic pressure** | Economic hardship can trigger unrest, elite dissent, or elite loss of patronage. | Pushes internal actors to pressure the leadership to change. |\n\nThese steps are not automatic; they can be blocked, mitigated, or reversed by the target\u2019s own actions (e.g., evasion, alternative partners) or by unintended side\u2011effects (e.g., humanitarian suffering that hardens popular support for the regime).\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Empirical findings on \u201cdoes it work?\u201d\n\n### 2.1  Broad\u2011scale meta\u2011analyses  \n\n| Study | Sample | Main result |\n|-------|--------|-------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* | 191 sanctions (1970\u20112005) | **\u224834\u202f%** achieved their stated foreign\u2011policy objectives; **\u224824\u202f%** led to partial compliance; the rest were ineffective or ambiguous. |\n| **Peksen (2019)** \u2013 *The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions* (meta\u2011analysis of 45 papers) | 2,300 sanction cases | Effectiveness rises when sanctions are **multilateral**, **targeted** (rather than comprehensive), and when the target is **economically dependent** on sanctioning states. |\n| **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox* | 73 cases (post\u2011Cold\u2011War) | Sanctions are more likely to succeed when the **target is a democracy** or when the **imposing coalition is cohesive**; otherwise they often backfire. |\n| **Pape (1997)** \u2013 *Why Economic Sanctions Fail* | 40 major cases (post\u2011World\u2011War\u2011II) | Argues that sanctions rarely achieve *regime change* and are more successful when they are **secondary** (punishing third\u2011party trading partners). |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Sanctions work **occasionally** and usually **partially**, and their success is highly conditional.\n\n### 2.2  What makes sanctions more likely to succeed?\n\n| Factor | Evidence | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------|----------------|\n| **Multilateralism** | Hufbauer et\u202fal. (2007) find a 2\u20113\u00d7 higher success rate for UN\u2011mandated or EU\u2011wide sanctions than for unilateral U.S. measures. | Reduces opportunities for evasion and signals broader political resolve. |\n| **Targeted (smart) design** | Peksen (2019) shows that sanctions aimed at specific individuals, entities, or sectors (e.g., asset freezes, travel bans",

      "unknown_model_response": "## What \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d are \u2013 and how they differ from \u201cprimary\u201d sanctions  \n\n| Aspect | **Primary sanctions** | **Secondary sanctions** |\n|--------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| **Who is *directly* prohibited** | **People, firms, or sectors inside the *target* country** (or its government\u2011owned entities). The sanction\u2011issuing state tells its own nationals and anyone who wants to do business with it: \u201cYou may not trade with X.\u201d | **Third\u2011country persons or entities** that *are not themselves the primary target* but that provide *any* assistance\u2014goods, services, financing, technology\u2014to the primary target. The sanction\u2011issuing state says: \u201cIf you help X, you will be treated as if you were X.\u201d |\n| **Legal jurisdiction** | Usually exercised under the sanction\u2011issuer\u2019s own domestic law (e.g., U.S. *International Emergency Economic Powers Act* (IEEPA), EU *Common Foreign and Security Policy*). It can be applied to *any* person who falls under that jurisdiction (U.S. persons, EU persons, etc.). | Often extends the **reach of the issuer\u2019s domestic law** to *foreign* persons that have no direct connection to the issuer\u2019s territory. The issuer claims \u201cextraterritorial\u201d authority: any non\u2011U.S./non\u2011EU person who deals with the primary target can be **punished** (e.g., denied access to the U.S. financial system). |\n| **Mechanism of enforcement** | Direct bans on imports/exports, asset freezes, travel bans, or licensing restrictions that apply to the target itself. | **Secondary measures** such as: <br>\u2022 **Denial of access to the issuer\u2019s financial system** (U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) adds the third\u2011party to the SDN list). <br>\u2022 **Prohibition on U.S./EU market participation** (e.g., a foreign bank that continues to lend to the sanctioned country may be barred from U.S. dollar clearing). <br>\u2022 **Secondary trade bans** (e.g., EU \u201cthird\u2011country\u201d restrictions on goods that could be trans\u2011shipped to the primary target). |\n| **Typical purpose** | Directly cripple the target\u2019s ability to obtain money, technology, or goods needed for the objectionable activity (e.g., nuclear weapons, human\u2011rights abuses). | **Close loopholes** that allow the target to evade primary sanctions by using intermediaries; also **signal to the international business community** that \u201cyou cannot hide behind a neutral third country.\u201d |\n| **Typical scope** | Usually *sector\u2011specific* (oil, arms, finance) or *person\u2011specific* (designated individuals). | Often *sector\u2011wide* or *activity\u2011wide* (any transaction that benefits the target), even if the third\u2011party is dealing in an unrelated product (e.g., a ship\u2011owner that merely provides insurance for a vessel that later carries Iranian oil). |\n| **Risk for third parties** | Minimal if they avoid dealing with the primary target. | Higher compliance cost: they must monitor their entire supply chain and may have to *re\u2011structure* business relationships to avoid secondary penalties. |\n\n---\n\n## How secondary sanctions work in practice  \n\n### 1.  The legal \u201ctrigger\u201d  \n\n1. **Primary sanction regime is declared** (e.g., UN\u202fResolution\u202f1929 on Iran, U.S. Executive Order\u202f13382 on proliferators).  \n2. **Secondary authority is codified** in domestic statutes or executive orders. In the U.S., the relevant statutes are:  \n   * **IEEPA** \u2013 gives the President authority to \u201cregulate any transactions\u201d that \u201cthreaten the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\u201d <br>* **National Emergencies Act** \u2013 allows the President to proclaim a national emergency and issue secondary measures. <br>* **Specific Executive Orders** (e.g., EO\u202f13662 on Iran\u2019s energy sector).  \n3. **Regulatory guidance** (e.g., OFAC\u2019s \u201cGeneral Licenses\u201d and \u201cFAQs\u201d) spells out which activities are prohibited for *non\u2011U.S.* persons.  \n\n### 2.  Enforcement levers  \n\n| Lever | Example of use |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) listing** | A European bank that continues to process Iranian oil payments is placed on the SDN list; its U.S. dollar clearing ability is cut off. |\n| **Denial of U.S. export licenses** | A Chinese aircraft\u2011parts firm that ships dual\u2011use components to a Russian defense contractor is denied an",
