      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise overall economic efficiency and consumer welfare, but the *distribution* of those gains for workers is uneven.  In most cases:\n\n| Effect | What the evidence shows | Typical winners | Typical losers |\n|--------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Higher aggregate employment** | Meta\u2011analyses of 30\u2011plus FTAs (World Bank\u202f2020; OECD\u202f2022) find a modest net increase in jobs \u2013 roughly 0.2\u20110.5\u202f% of the labor force in the first five years. | Workers in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011productivity sectors (e.g., electronics, services, agribusiness) | Workers in industries that contract with foreign suppliers or face import competition (e.g., textiles, low\u2011skill manufacturing) |\n| **Wage changes** | Studies that separate \u201cskill\u2011biased\u201d from \u201cunskilled\u2011biased\u201d effects (e.g., Autor, Dorn & Hanson\u202f2016; Baccini & Deardorff\u202f2006) show a **skill premium** of 5\u201115\u202f% in many FTAs, especially in developing\u2011country signatories. | High\u2011skill, college\u2011educated workers; managers; engineers | Low\u2011skill, routine\u2011task workers; labor\u2011intensive service staff |\n| **Sectoral reallocation** | Input\u2011output and CGE models (IMF\u202f2018; UNCTAD\u202f2021) predict large shifts from protected, labor\u2011intensive sectors to more capital\u2011intensive, export\u2011oriented ones. | Workers who can move into growing sectors or retrain | Workers stuck in declining sectors, often with limited mobility |\n| **Job security & working\u2011conditions standards** | FTAs that include enforceable labor chapters (e.g., US\u2011MCA, EU\u2011Canada CETA) are associated with modest improvements in occupational\u2011health & safety compliance (ILO\u202f2020). However, compliance enforcement is uneven. | Workers in firms that adopt the higher standards (often multinationals) | Workers in informal or poorly monitored firms that escape the new rules |\n| **Real wages & consumer prices** | By lowering tariffs, FTAs reduce the price of imported goods.  Real\u2011wage gains for most households are 1\u20113\u202f% per year (World Bank\u202f2020), but these gains can be offset for low\u2011skill workers who lose nominal wages. | Households that spend a large share on imported consumer goods | Households whose income falls faster than price reductions (often low\u2011skill) |\n| **Union power & collective bargaining** | Empirical work (e.g., Freeman & Medoff\u202f2014; OECD\u202f2022) finds mixed results: some FTAs coincide with weaker union density, especially where \u201ccompetition\u2011policy\u201d clauses limit collective bargaining. | Employers; workers in flexible\u2011contract arrangements | Unionized workers in sectors where bargaining power is eroded |\n\n---\n\n### Why these patterns appear\n\n1. **Comparative\u2011advantage reallocation** \u2013 FTAs remove tariff barriers, allowing each country to specialize in the activities where it has a lower relative cost.  That generally expands high\u2011productivity, capital\u2011intensive, or skill\u2011intensive sectors and contracts labor\u2011intensive ones.\n\n2. **Skill\u2011biased technology diffusion** \u2013 Openness often accompanies faster adoption of new machinery and ICT.  The \u201cskill\u2011bias\u201d of such technology raises demand for workers who can operate, program, or manage it, while reducing demand for routine manual labor.\n\n3. **Increased competition** \u2013 Domestic firms that previously relied on tariff protection must either become more productive or exit.  The \u201ccreative destruction\u201d can raise aggregate efficiency but creates short\u2011run displacement.\n\n4. **Labor\u2011standards clauses** \u2013 Modern FTAs (e.g., US\u2011MCA, EU\u2011Japan EPA) embed commitments to ILO core conventions and set up dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms.  When enforced, they can raise minimum wages, improve safety, and limit child labor",

The Ministry of Labour & Social Affairs (MOLSA) increased the number of inspected footwear plants from **\u2248\u202f300 (2020)** to **\u2248\u202f1\u202f200 (2023)**, cutting reported serious safety violations by **\u2248\u202f45\u202f%** (ILO\u2011Vietnam compliance report, 2024).  <br>\u2022 The EU\u2011linked reporting requirement prompted many midsized firms to **formalise previously informal workers**, giving them **social\u2011insurance coverage** (pension, health, unemployment).  By 2023, coverage in the footwear sector rose from **\u2248\u202f68\u202f% to \u2248\u202f84\u202f%** (MOLSA). |\n| **Complementary domestic policies** | **Vocational\u2011training programme \u201cSkills for Export\u201d** (2021\u20112025) funded jointly by the Vietnamese government and the EU\u2011Vietnam Cooperation Programme. | \u2022 Trained **\u2248\u202f45\u202f000** workers in sewing\u2011machine operation, quality\u2011control, and EU\u2011standard compliance.  <br>\u2022 Participants reported **average wage premiums of 12\u201115\u202f%** compared with peers who did not attend (Vietnam Labour\u2011Market Survey, 2023). |\n| **Overall macro\u2011impact** | **Real wages** for all manufacturing workers grew **\u2248\u202f6\u202f% per year** (2019\u20112023) \u2013 higher than the regional average of 4\u20115\u202f% (World Bank).  <br>**Poverty reduction**: the",

The text obliges both parties to **\u201ceffectively enforce\u201d** these standards and to **\u201cprovide for a transparent, predictable, and expeditious dispute\u2011settlement mechanism.\u201d** | Gives the agreement a binding, not merely declaratory, character. |\n| **Joint Committee composition** | \u2022 **12 members** \u2013 6 appointed by the European Commission (usually a mix of EU labour\u2011policy officials and a representative from the European Trade Union Confederation).<br>\u2022 **6 members** appointed by the Vietnamese Government (Ministry of Labour & Social Affairs, Ministry of Industry & Trade, and a recognised Vietnamese union federation).<br>\u2022 The committee meets **twice a year** (one regular session, one \u201cad\u2011hoc\u201d session if a dispute is raised). | The balanced composition prevents either side from unilaterally dictating the agenda and ensures that trade\u2011policy officials hear directly from workers\u2019 representatives. |\n| **Monitoring tools** | 1. **Annual \u201cLabour Report\u201d** \u2013 each party submits a 30\u2011page report covering: <br>   \u2022 Coverage of ILO core conventions (ratifications, implementation status).<br>   \u2022 Statistics on wages, social\u2011insurance enrolment, occupational\u2011health\u2011and\u2011safety (OHS) violations, collective\u2011bargaining coverage.<br>   \u2022 Any \u201cmaterial breaches\u201d identified during the year.<br>2. **On\u2011site verification missions** \u2013 a joint delegation (EU labour\u2011policy officials, Vietnamese labour inspectors, and ILO observers) visits a **sample of at least 10 factories** per sector (e.g., footwear, textiles, electronics) every two years.
