      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Scientific consensus:**  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies **processed meat** as *carcinogenic to humans* (Group\u202f1) and **unprocessed red meat** (beef, pork, lamb, goat) as *probably carcinogenic* (Group\u202f2A).  \n- **Magnitude of risk:**  For most cancers the observed relative risk (RR) associated with typical levels of red\u2011meat intake is modest (\u2248\u202f1.1\u20131.3 per\u202f\u2248\u202f100\u202fg/day), with the strongest and most consistent association being for **colorectal cancer**.  \n- **What is well\u2011established:**  A dose\u2011response relationship exists between higher consumption of processed meat and colorectal cancer; a smaller but reproducible association exists for unprocessed red meat and colorectal cancer, and weaker or inconsistent links are reported for pancreatic and prostate cancer.  \n- **What remains debated/uncertain:**  The exact size of the risk for unprocessed red meat, the role of cooking methods, the impact of meat type (grass\u2011fed vs. grain\u2011fed), and how much the risk can be mitigated by substituting other protein sources.  \n- **Key take\u2011away for a lay reader:**  Eating large amounts of processed meat clearly raises cancer risk; eating moderate amounts of unprocessed red meat (e.g., \u2264\u202f500\u202fg/week) adds a small additional risk, but the absolute increase in risk for an individual is modest compared with other lifestyle factors (smoking, excess body weight, low physical activity).\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive synthesis** of the strongest evidence, organized by (1) the nature of the evidence, (2) the cancers most often studied, (3) mechanisms that have been proposed, (4) points of agreement, (5) major uncertainties, and (6) common misconceptions on all sides of the debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
