If the measured value drifts outside the target range, the pump\u2019s set\u2011point is adjusted. |",

Could you explain how the utilities decide what the \u201crecommended level\u201d should be, and maybe give an example of the actual concentration they aim for in a typical city\u2019s water supply?",

Sources of the Fluoride\u2011Level Recommendation  \n\n| Source | What it says about the \u201coptimal\u201d fluoride concentration | How utilities use it |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) \u2013 Community Water Fluoridation (CWF)\u202fGuidelines** (2022 update) | Recommends a **single, uniform target of 0.7\u202fmg of fluoride per litre (mg\u202fF/L)** for all U.S. public\u2011water systems, regardless of climate. The value is chosen because it provides the best balance of caries\u2011prevention benefit and risk of dental fluorosis in the current U.S. population. | Most U.S. utilities adopt 0.7\u202fmg\u202fF/L as the *primary* operational goal. The CDC guideline is not a regulation, but it is the benchmark used by state health departments and the American Dental Association (ADA). |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 Guidelines for Drinking\u2011Water Quality (4th\u202fed., 2017)** | Sets a **provisional guideline value of 0.5\u202fmg\u202fF/L** (with an upper \u201cacceptable\u201d range up to 1.0\u202fmg\u202fF/L) for communities that choose fluoridation, based on a global assessment of caries risk and fluorosis prevalence. | Utilities outside the U.S. (e.g., in Canada, Australia, parts of Europe, and many developing\u2011country programs) often adopt the WHO range, then adjust upward or downward according to local dental\u2011health data. |\n| **National/State Public\u2011Health Agencies** (e.g., Public\u2011Health England, Health Canada, Australian Dental Association) | Issue **country\u2011specific recommendations** that may differ from WHO because of local climate, water\u2011consumption patterns, and baseline fluoride in natural water. | Utilities must follow the legally binding guidance of the jurisdiction in which they operate. |\n| **Regulatory Limits \u2013 Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)** | In the U.S., the **EPA\u2019s MCL for fluoride is 4.0\u202fmg\u202fF/L** (the level at which adverse health effects become a regulatory violation). Other countries have similar \u201cupper\u2011limit\u201d standards (e.g., Canada\u2019s 1.5\u202fmg/L for water intended for human consumption). | The MCL is a *safety ceiling*; utilities never aim anywhere near it. It is used for compliance monitoring and for emergency\u2011stop criteria. |\n| **Scientific Literature on Dental Fluorosis & Caries** | Large epidemiologic studies (e.g., the U",
