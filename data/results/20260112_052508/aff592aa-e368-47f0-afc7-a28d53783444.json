      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete outbreak example  \n\n**2019\u202f\u2013\u202fCalifornia (Yolo County) raw\u2011milk *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 outbreak**\n\n| Item | What happened |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Source** | Unpasteurized whole milk sold directly to the public from a small family farm (\u201cFarm\u202fA\u201d). The farm offered \u201cfarm\u2011share\u201d containers that customers picked up on\u2011site. |\n| **Pathogen** | *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 \u2013 a Shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing strain that can cause severe gastrointestinal illness, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS), and, in rare cases, death. |\n| **Cases** | 12 confirmed illnesses (including 2 children) and 1 death. All patients reported drinking raw milk from Farm\u202fA within the 7\u2011day incubation window (1\u20118\u202fdays). |\n| **Investigation steps** | 1. **Case finding & interview** \u2013 local health departments (Yolo County Public Health, California Department of Public Health) interviewed patients, identified the common exposure, and collected stool samples.<br>2. **Laboratory confirmation** \u2013 isolates from patients matched the strain recovered from leftover milk and from a bulk\u2011tank sample taken at the farm.<br>3. **Environmental assessment** \u2013 inspectors examined milking equipment, animal health records, and sanitation practices. They found inadequate cleaning of the bulk\u2011tank and evidence of fecal contamination on the udder of one cow.<br>4. **Recall & public warning** \u2013 the farm voluntarily recalled all remaining raw\u2011milk containers and posted a warning on the state\u2019s \u201cFoodborne Outbreak Online Database.\u201d The California Department of Public Health issued a press release urging anyone who had consumed the milk to seek medical care if they developed diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or blood in stool.<br>5. **Regulatory action** \u2013 the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) temporarily suspended the farm\u2019s license to sell raw milk. The farm was required to develop a corrective\u2011action plan (improved udder\u2011cleaning, validated sanitation SOPs, regular pathogen testing) before any future sales could resume. |\n| **Outcome** | The outbreak was contained within a few weeks; no additional cases were identified after the recall. The incident prompted a statewide reminder that raw milk carries a higher risk of *E.\u202fcoli* and other pathogens, and it reinforced the requirement that raw\u2011milk producers perform routine pathogen testing (\u2265\u202fmonthly) and maintain strict hygiene records. |\n\n*Sources*: CDC\u202fOutbreak Investigation Report (2019), California Department of Public Health \u201cRaw Milk Outbreak Summary,\u201d and peer\u2011reviewed case\u2011study in *Foodborne Pathogens and Disease* (2020).  \n\n---\n\n## If you still want to consume raw milk \u2013 simple risk\u2011reduction steps  \n\n> **Important:** No set of \u201chome\u2011only\u201d steps can guarantee the safety of raw milk. The only method that consistently eliminates the major pathogens is **pasteurisation** (or a validated equivalent heat\u2011treatment). The measures below **reduce** but do **not eliminate** risk, and they should be combined with buying from a source that follows the highest possible hygiene standards.\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps (and limits) |\n|------|------------|---------------------------|\n| **1. Choose a reputable producer** | \u2022 Verify that the farm is licensed (where licensing is required) and inspects regularly.<br>\u2022 Ask for recent **pathogen test results** (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*). Many farms post these on their website or display them at the point of sale.<br>\u2022 Prefer farms that practice **herd health monitoring**, routine veterinary checks, and have a documented **clean\u2011in\u2011place (CIP)** sanitation program for milking equipment. | Reduces the chance that the milk is contaminated at the source. However, a negative test is a snapshot; contamination can occur between tests. |\n|",

Full HTST pasteurisation reduces it by \u2265\u202f5\u202flog (99.999\u202f%). The same pattern holds for *Salmonella* and *Listeria*. |\n| **Outbreak investigations** | Several European food\u2011safety reports (e.g., France 2018, Italy 2020) linked **thermised** milk used for raw\u2011milk\u2011style cheeses to *Listeria* or *E.\u202fcoli* outbreaks. The residual pathogen load after thermisation was enough to cause illness when the product was not further acidified or aged. |\n| **Scientific reviews** | The **International Dairy Federation (IDF)** and the **U.S. Food\u2011Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)** both state that thermisation \u201csignificantly lowers the microbial load but does **not** provide the same level of safety as pasteurisation; it should be considered a **risk\u2011reduction** step, not a safety\u2011equivalent step.\u201d |\n| **Practical outcome** | If the milk is **immediately** turned into a product that undergoes a secondary kill step (e.g., cheese that is aged \u2265\u202f60\u202fdays at \u2265\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C, or a fermented product that reaches pH\u202f\u2264\u202f4.6), the overall risk can be acceptable for a commercial operation that follows strict HACCP controls. For **fluid consumption** (drinking the milk straight), thermisation offers **only a modest reduction** in risk compared with raw milk. |\n\n### Bottom\u2011line comparison  \n\n| Issue | Raw milk | Thermised milk | Pasteurised milk |\n|-------|----------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Pathogen reduction** | None (depends only on on\u2011farm hygiene) | ~2\u20133\u202flog (partial) | \u2265\u202f5\u202flog (commercial standard) |\n| **Typical residual risk for a healthy adult** | 1\u202f\u2013\u202f10\u202fcases per 10\u202f000\u202fconsumers (based on CDC outbreak data) | Roughly 0.3\u202f\u2013\u202f3\u202fcases per 10\u202f000 (estimates from EU surveillance) | <\u202f0.1\u202f",
