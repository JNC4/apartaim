      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall efficiency of the economies that sign them, but the gains are not spread evenly. For most workers the short\u2011run experience is a mix of **job gains in expanding export sectors**, **job losses or wage pressure in import\u2011competing sectors**, and **long\u2011run changes in skill demand and bargaining power**. The size and direction of these effects depend on a country\u2019s level of development, its labour\u2011market institutions, and the design of the agreement.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most robust evidence from the academic literature, international organisations (World Bank, OECD, ILO) and policy analyses of major FTAs (NAFTA/USMCA, EU single market, ASEAN, CPTPP, EU\u2011Mercosur, etc.).  \n\n---\n\n## 1. What FTAs do, in economic terms\n\n| Mechanism | Typical outcome for the economy | Why it matters for workers |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination** (and reduced non\u2011tariff barriers) | Lower consumer prices, higher export volumes, cheaper imported inputs | Firms that rely on imported intermediate goods can cut costs and become more competitive; consumers enjoy higher real wages. |\n| **Rules of origin & standards** | Encourages firms to source locally to qualify for duty\u2011free status | May protect some domestic industries, but can also raise compliance costs. |\n| **Investment\u2011protection chapters** | Attract foreign direct investment (FDI) by reducing legal uncertainty | New plants can create jobs, often in export\u2011oriented sectors, but they may also crowd out domestic firms. |\n| **Labor\u2011related provisions** (e.g., ILO\u2011core conventions, dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms) | Vary widely; some FTAs include enforceable labour standards, others only \u201csoft\u201d language | Strong provisions can help raise working\u2011condition standards; weak ones provide little direct protection. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

I separate the findings into three layers:\n\n| Layer | What the literature tells us | Where consensus (or genuine disagreement) lies |\n|------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Aggregate\u2011economy outcomes** | FTAs raise the **overall size of the economy** (GDP) by 0.1\u20110.5\u202f% per year of tariff reduction, according to meta\u2011analyses of the World Bank, IMF and OECD (e.g., **Baldwin\u202f&\u202fEvenett\u202f2020**; **Bown\u202f2021**).  The main channels are lower import prices, export expansion, and productivity gains from cheaper intermediate inputs. | **Consensus:** Most economists agree that FTAs are *positive on average* for national welfare, but the magnitude is modest compared with other policy levers (e.g., education, infrastructure). |\n| **2. Distributional effects on workers** | The net\u2011gain is *unevenly shared*: workers in **import\u2011competing sectors** (often low\u2011skill manufacturing) tend to lose jobs or see wages fall, while workers in **export\u2011oriented or trade\u2011intensive services** (high\u2011skill, high\u2011productivity) tend to gain.  The pattern appears across a wide range of studies: <br> \u2022 **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013, \u201cThe China Shock\u201d)** \u2013 U.S. counties exposed to Chinese import competition lost ~1\u20112\u202f% of manufacturing employment per year, with lasting wage penalties for low\u2011skill workers. <br> \u2022 **Felbermayr, Larch, & Schmerer (2020, \u201cTrade and the Wage Distribution\u201d)** \u2013 In the EU, FTAs reduced the wage gap between the 10th and 90th percentiles by ~0.5\u202f% per year of deeper integration. <br> \u2022 **Miller, L. et\u202fal. (2022, \u201cNAFTA and the U.S. Labor Market\u201d)** \u2013 NAFTA\u2019s net effect on U.S. employment was statistically zero, but *regional* impacts were large: the \u201cborder states\u201d lost ~0.3\u202f% of manufacturing jobs per year, while \u201cexport\u2011oriented\u201d states (e.g., Texas) gained ~0.2\u202f% in high\u2011skill services. <br> \u2022 **World Bank (2021) \u201cTrade and Jobs in Africa\u201d** \u2013 In low\u2011income African countries, FTAs have *not* produced large formal\u2011sector job gains; most benefits accrue through lower consumer prices and informal\u2011sector activity. | **Broad agreement** that FTAs create *winners and losers* at the worker level. The *direction* (gain vs. loss) is well\u2011documented; the *size* of the effect varies by country, sector, and labor\u2011market institutions. |\n| **3. Institutional and policy moderators** | The magnitude of worker outcomes hinges on *how the FTA is designed* and on *domestic adjustment policies*: <br> \u2022 **Labor\u2011rights chapters** (e.g., US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada",
