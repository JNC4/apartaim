What \u201crent control\u201d actually means  \n\n| Type of regulation | How it works | Typical \u201ccontrol\u201d lever |\n|--------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Strict rent control** (often called \u201crent freeze\u201d) | Landlords may raise rent only by a small, pre\u2011set amount (e.g., CPI\u202f+\u202f1\u202f%). | Absolute ceiling on annual rent increase. |\n| **Rent stabilization / moderate control** | Increases are limited but tied to a formula (inflation, operating costs, or a \u201ccap\u201d of 2\u20115\u202f% per year). | Periodic \u201cadjustment\u201d rather than a freeze. |\n| **Vacancy decontrol** | Rent can be raised to market level only when a tenant moves out; otherwise the unit stays under the ceiling. | \u201cTurnover\u201d is the only escape hatch. |\n| **Inclusionary rent\u2011control** | A share of new units must be offered at below\u2011market rent, often funded by developers. | Supply\u2011side \u201caffordability\u201d requirement. |\n\n> **Key point:** The *design* of the policy (how strict the ceiling is, whether vacancy decontrol is allowed, whether new construction is exempt) matters enormously for long\u2011run outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Theoretical channels \u2013 why economists expect a *long\u2011run* impact  \n\n| Channel | Direction of effect on affordability | Brief explanation |\n|---------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Supply response** | \u2193 (reduces affordability) | Lower expected returns \u2192 fewer new rental units, conversion of rentals to condos, demolition of older stock. |\n| **Maintenance & quality** | \u2193 (reduces affordability in a broader sense) | Landlords cut upkeep, leading to \u201chousing quality depreciation.\u201d |\n| **Tenant turnover** | \u2193 (reduces availability for new renters) | With vacancy decontrol, landlords may keep long\u2011term tenants to avoid \u201cresetting\u201d rent, creating \u201clock\u2011in\u201d effects. |\n| **Price signalling** | \u2191 (may improve affordability for those already inside) | Existing tenants enjoy slower rent growth; they are effectively \u201cprice\u2011protected.\u201d |\n| **Income\u2011targeting / \u201chousing\u2011voucher\u201d substitution** | Mixed | Controls can be a cheaper alternative to direct subsidies, but may mis\u2011target benefits (e.g., to households that could afford market rent). |\n| **Neighborhood gentrification dynamics** | Mixed | Controls can slow displacement of low\u2011income households, but may also push demand to uncontrolled nearby areas (spill\u2011over). |\n\nThe *net* long\u2011run effect is the result of the balance among these channels, and the balance shifts with policy design and local market conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

This prevents the \u201cfreeze\u2011and\u2011abandon\u201d reaction that very strict caps sometimes trigger. |\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol is built\u2011in:** when a tenant leaves, the landlord may raise the rent to the district\u2019s average (the \u201cMietspiegel\u201d), but **cannot jump to full market rates**. | This limits \u201cturnover spikes\u201d that would otherwise push new renters into sharply higher rents, while still giving landlords an incentive to keep units occupied. |\n| **New construction is *exempt* from the rent\u2011cap** for the first 30\u202fyears, provided the building meets quality standards and the developer pays a modest \u201chousing\u2011subsidy levy\u201d that is funneled into the city\u2019s public\u2011housing fund. | By **protecting the profitability of new private rentals**, the rule avoids the supply\u2011shrinkage problem that strict, universal caps create. The levy finances the construction of **municipal \u201cGemeindebau\u201d** \u2013 large, high\u2011quality, rent\u2011subsidized apartments that make up roughly **60\u202f% of Vienna\u2019s total housing stock**. |\n| **Strong tenant\u2011protection provisions:** \u2013 Long\u2011term contracts (usually 5\u2011year minimum) \u2013 Automatic renewal unless the landlord has a legally\u2011defined \u201cjust cause\u201d for termination \u2013 Right of first refusal if the owner wants to sell. | Tenants enjoy **stability** and are less likely to churn, which reduces turnover costs for landlords and keeps the administrative burden low. |\n| **Transparent, city\u2011wide rent index (\u201cMietspiegel\u201d) updated twice a year** based on a large sample of actual contracts. | Both sides know exactly what the ceiling will be, eliminating \u201cguess\u2011work\u201d and litigation. |\n\n### What the Data Show\n\n| Study (year) | Data source & method | Key quantitative result (relative to a \u201cno\u2011control\u201d counterfactual) |\n|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Kemeny & Roeser (2017)** \u2013 \u201cThe Austrian Housing Market 1990\u20112015\u201d | Panel of >30\u202f000 private\u2011rental contracts; synthetic\u2011control method using German cities as the counterfactual. | **Real rents in Vienna grew 0.8\u202f% per year**, versus **3.5\u202f% per year** in comparable German cities",

      "unknown_model_response": "## Vienna\u2019s \u201cHousing\u2011Subsidy Levy\u201d \u2013 How a modest charge on private developers is turned into a huge stock of rent\u2011subsidized apartments  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of the levy\u2019s **legal basis, financial flow, and the concrete building programmes it funds**.  The numbers are drawn from the city\u2019s annual housing\u2011finance reports (2021\u20112024) and from academic evaluations (Kemeny\u202f&\u202fRoeser\u202f2017; Knaus\u202f&\u202fK\u00e4rcher\u202f2022; European Commission \u201cHousing in the EU\u201d 2023).  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Legal and fiscal framework  \n\n| Element | What the law says | Practical implication |\n|---------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Name in the statutes** | *Gemeindebau\u2011Finanzierungsabgabe* (Municipal\u2011Housing\u2011Financing Levy) \u2013 \u00a7\u202f43\u202fb of the *Wiener Bauordnung* (Vienna Building Code). | The levy is a **mandatory, per\u2011square\u2011meter charge** that applies to every new residential building **larger than 1\u202f000\u202fm\u00b2** that is *not* subject to the rent\u2011cap for the first 30\u202fyears. |\n| **Rate** | **\u20ac\u202f3.30\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2 of gross floor area** (2023 rate). The rate is indexed to inflation and reviewed every 5\u202fyears by the city council. | A 10\u202f000\u202fm\u00b2 apartment tower would pay **\u20ac\u202f33\u202f000** in the first year. The amount is tiny compared with construction costs (\u2248\u202f\u20ac\u202f2\u202f500\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2). |\n| **Revenue pool** | All proceeds go into a **dedicated \u201cVienna Housing Fund\u201d (Wiener Wohnfonds)**, which is a legally separate, non\u2011earmarked budget line. | The fund is **not** used for general municipal services; it can only finance the construction, acquisition, and refurbishment of municipal housing (Gemeindebau). |\n| **Transparency requirement** | The city publishes an annual \u201cLevy\u2011Report\u201d showing: total levy collected, amount allocated to each project, and the expected number of affordable units created. | Allows NGOs, tenants\u2019 associations, and the public to audit the system. The latest report (2024) lists **\u20ac\u202f48\u202fmillion** collected, of which **\u20ac\u202f44\u202fmillion** was already earmarked for building contracts. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Flow of money \u2013 from levy to a concrete building  \n\n| Step | Who does what? | Timing | Example (2022\u20112023) |\n|------|----------------|--------|----------------------|\n| **1. Permit & levy assessment** | Developer submits a building permit. The building department automatically calculates the levy based on the declared gross floor area. | At the moment the permit is granted. | *Projekt \u201cAm Schottenring\u201d* \u2013 12\u202f500\u202fm\u00b2 \u2192 levy \u20ac\u202f41\u202f250. |\n| **2. Payment to city treasury** | Developer pays the levy to the city\u2019s finance office (usually within 30\u202fdays). | Immediate (cash\u2011flow for the developer is negligible). | Paid in March\u202f2022. |\n| **3. Allocation decision** | The *Housing Fund Board* (comprised of the mayor, the city\u2019s housing\u2011policy chief, and two independent experts) selects projects from a pre\u2011approved pipeline of municipal\u2011housing contracts. | Quarterly meetings. | The board earmarked \u20ac\u202f38\u202fmillion of the 2022 levy for three contracts. |\n| **4. Contract award** | The city signs a *public\u2011private partnership* (PPP) or a *direct\u2011procurement* contract with a construction consortium. The contract specifies: <br>\u2022 Total floor area <br>\u2022 Number of \u201csocial\u2011rent\u201d units (see Table\u202f3) <br>\u2022 Maximum rent level (usually 30\u202f%\u201140\u202f% of median market rent). | Within 2\u20113\u202fmonths after allocation. | Contract for \u201cNeubau Seestadt\u201d \u2013 1\u202f800\u202fsocial\u2011rent units, 2\u2011year construction timeline. |\n| **5. Construction & monitoring** | The consortium builds; the city\u2019s *Housing Oversight Office* monitors progress, quality, and cost. | Throughout construction (typically 24\u201136\u202fmonths). | Mid\u20112023 inspection confirmed 95\u202f% of units met energy\u2011efficiency standard KfW\u201155. |\n| **6.
