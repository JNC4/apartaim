      "unknown_model_response": "### Main Health Concerns People Have Raised About 5G Cell Towers\n\n| Concern | What People Say | Why It Raises Alarm |\n|---------|----------------|---------------------|\n| **Radio\u2011frequency (RF) radiation exposure** | 5G uses higher\u2011frequency millimeter\u2011wave bands (e.g., 24\u202fGHz, 28\u202fGHz, 39\u202fGHz) in addition to the lower bands used by earlier generations. Some worry that the increased number of small cells and the higher frequencies could lead to greater exposure of the public\u2019s body to RF energy. | RF energy is a form of non\u2011ionizing electromagnetic radiation. While it cannot break chemical bonds, the sheer volume of antennas in dense urban areas makes people wonder if cumulative exposure could have biological effects. |\n| **Potential cancer risk** | A few groups cite studies on rodents exposed to high\u2011level RF fields that showed increased tumor incidence, arguing that similar mechanisms might operate in humans. | Cancer is a serious, long\u2011term disease, and any factor that could increase risk is taken seriously. |\n| **Neurological effects** | Claims include headaches, dizziness, sleep disturbances, and \u201cbrain fog\u201d that some attribute to living near 5G infrastructure. | The brain is highly sensitive to changes in its environment, and some people report symptoms that they associate with electromagnetic exposure. |\n| **Reproductive and developmental concerns** | Some research on cell cultures and animal models suggests that RF exposure could affect sperm motility or fetal development, leading to worries about fertility and birth outcomes. | Reproductive health is a fundamental concern for individuals and societies; any potential threat can generate public unease. |\n| **Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS)** | A subset of the population reports that they experience a range of nonspecific symptoms (e.g., fatigue, skin irritation) when near wireless devices or antennas, and they fear that 5G will exacerbate these symptoms. | While the condition is not yet recognized as a medical diagnosis, the reported experiences are real to those affected, prompting calls for precaution. |\n\n### What Current Scientific Research Says\n\n| Topic | Main Findings from Peer\u2011Reviewed Studies & Authoritative Bodies | Interpretation |\n|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **RF exposure limits** | National and international guidelines (e.g., ICNIRP, IEEE, FCC) set exposure limits well below levels that cause known tissue heating. 5G equipment is required to meet these limits. | The consensus is that, when devices operate within these limits, they do **not** produce adverse health effects attributable to heating. |\n| **Cancer risk** | Large epidemiological studies (e.g., the INTERPHONE study, Danish cohort, U.S. National Toxicology Program) have not found a consistent link between typical mobile\u2011phone RF exposure and increased cancer rates. The WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies RF fields as **\u201cpossibly carcinogenic\u201d (Group 2B)**, a category that also includes coffee and pickled vegetables, reflecting limited evidence. | Evidence for a causal relationship between everyday RF exposure (including 5G) and cancer remains weak and inconclusive. |\n| **Non\u2011thermal biological effects** | Laboratory studies investigating DNA damage, oxidative stress, or neuronal activity at exposure levels below safety limits have produced mixed, often non\u2011replicable results. Systematic reviews (e.g., by the BioInitiative Report, the European Commission\u2019s SCENIHR) conclude that there is **no credible evidence** of harmful non\u2011thermal effects at regulated exposure levels. | The",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How a Typical 5G Small\u2011Cell Antenna Stacks Up Against the Official Safety Limits  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration that shows **how the radio\u2011frequency (RF) field produced by a standard 5G small\u2011cell base station is many orders of magnitude lower than the exposure limits that most regulatory agencies (ICNIRP, IEEE, FCC, etc.) have set for the general public**.\n\n| Item | What it means | Typical value for a 5G small\u2011cell in a residential setting |\n|------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Maximum permissible exposure (MPE) for the public** (ICNIRP 2020) | The highest power\u2011density (PD) that can be present without any known health risk.
