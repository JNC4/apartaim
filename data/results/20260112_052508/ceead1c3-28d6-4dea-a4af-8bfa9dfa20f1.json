What \u201ceconomic sanctions\u201d mean\n\n| Category | Typical instruments | Who can impose them? |\n|----------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| **Comprehensive (or \u201ctotal\u201d) embargoes** | Ban on all trade, investment, financial flows | Usually a coalition of states (UN Security Council) or a single powerful country |\n| **Targeted (or \u201csmart\u201d) sanctions** | Asset freezes, travel bans, restrictions on specific firms, sectors (e.g., oil, weapons), or individuals | Unilateral (U.S., EU) or multilateral (EU\u2011US coordinated lists) |\n| **Secondary sanctions** | Penalties on third\u2011party firms that do business with the primary target | Mostly unilateral (U.S. Treasury\u2019s OFAC) |\n| **Financial sanctions** | Denial of access to SWIFT, prohibitions on dollar\u2011clearing, restrictions on sovereign\u2011bond markets | Multilateral (EU, G7) or unilateral |\n\nThe **goal** is never just to \u201churt\u201d the target\u2019s economy; it is to **change the target\u2019s behavior** (policy, military action, human\u2011rights practices, nuclear program, etc.) while minimizing humanitarian fallout.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Theoretical logic \u2013 how sanctions are *intended* to work\n\n1. **Coercive pressure (cost\u2011imposition)**  \n   - By raising the economic cost of the status\u2011quo, the target faces a \u201cpain\u2011vs\u2011gain\u201d calculation.  \n   - If the expected cost of compliance (policy change) is lower than the cost of continued defiance, rational actors should acquiesce.\n\n2. **Signalling and delegitimisation**  \n   - Sanctions broadcast international condemnation, lowering the target\u2019s legitimacy and making it harder for the regime to claim \u201cnormal\u201d trade relations.  \n   - This can encourage internal opposition or elite defections.\n\n3. **Domestic audience costs**  \n   - The imposing state(s) signal to their own publics that they are taking action, which can constrain future diplomatic flexibility and make a reversal politically costly.\n\n4. **Constraining resources for undesirable activities**  \n   - Cutting off financing for weapons programs, oil sales, or elite luxury spending directly reduces a regime\u2019s capacity to pursue the objectionable behavior.\n\n5. **Creating \u201cpolicy windows\u201d**  \n   - Sanctions can alter the internal balance of power (e.g., between hardliners and reformers) and open a window for diplomatic solutions.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  What the empirical literature says \u2013 success rates\n\n### 3.1  Broad quantitative syntheses  \n\n| Study (year) | Sample | Definition of \u201csuccess\u201d | Success rate* |\n|--------------|--------|------------------------|---------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* (2007)** | 221 cases (1970\u20112005) | Policy change consistent with sanctioning goal (including partial compliance) | **\u2248 34\u202f%** overall; 45\u202f% for **multilateral** cases, 23\u202f% for **unilateral** |\n| **Drezner \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox* (2011)** | 115 cases (post\u2011Cold\u2011War) | Regime change or policy shift | **\u2248 30\u202f%** |\n| **Pape \u2013 *Can Economic Sanctions Work?* (1997)** | 30 cases (Cold\u2011War era) | Desired policy change | **\u2248 0\u202f%** (Pape argues most successes were due to *co\u2011occurring* diplomatic pressure, not sanctions alone) |\n| **Hufbauer et\u202fal. (2021, updated dataset)** | 300+ cases (1970\u20112020) | Full or substantial compliance | **\u2248 44\u202f%** for *targeted* sanctions, **\u2248 26\u202f%** for *comprehensive* embargoes |\n\n\\*Success rates vary because scholars differ on (a) which outcomes count as \u201csuccess,\u201d (b) how far into the future they look, and (c) whether they treat partial compliance as a win.\n\n### 3.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **well\u2011documented case in which a series of *targeted* (often called \u201csmart\u201d) sanctions helped push a government to change the specific policy that had triggered the measures**.  \nThe example most scholars point to as a clear illustration of success is the **U.S.\u202f/\u202fEU sanctions campaign that forced Iran to negotiate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on its nuclear programme (2013\u20112015)**.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Background \u2013 What the sanctions aimed to achieve  \n\n| Issue | What Iran was doing | What the sanctioning coalition wanted |\n|------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Enrichment of uranium** | By 2009 Iran had installed ~3\u202f000 centrifuges and was enriching uranium up to 20\u202f% (well above the 3.5\u202f% limit set by the 2003\u20112005 \u201cParis\u201d and \u201cGlenn\u201d agreements). | **Stop the enrichment program** and bring Iran back into full compliance with its non\u2011proliferation obligations (i.e., the 2003\u20112005 agreements and the 1995 NPT safeguards). |\n| **Ballistic\u2011missile development** (secondary) | Parallel development of medium\u2011range missiles that could deliver a nuclear payload. | **Curtail missile work** (later added to the deal). |\n\nThe coalition (U.S., EU, UN Security Council, plus a handful of non\u2011UN members such as Canada and Japan) decided that **comprehensive trade embargoes would be counter\u2011productive** (they would hurt ordinary Iranians and could push the regime closer to Russia/China). Instead they **targeted**:\n\n1. **Financial & banking restrictions** \u2013 cutting off Iranian banks from the SWIFT messaging system and prohibiting U.S. dollar clearing for Iranian oil revenues.  \n2. **Sector\u2011specific oil sanctions** \u2013 a ban on the purchase of Iranian crude and petroleum products by U.S. persons and, later, by EU persons.  \n3. **Asset freezes & travel bans** on senior officials, Revolutionary Guard leaders, and key businessmen (e.g., the \u201cIran Sanctions Enforcement Act\u201d list).  \n4. **Secondary sanctions** \u2013 threatening non\u2011U.S. entities that continued to do business with Iran with loss of access to the U.S. financial system.\n\nThese measures were **incremental** (the \u201cphase\u2011out\u201d approach) and **publicly tied to specific policy demands**, which is a hallmark of \u201ctargeted\u201d sanctions.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Timeline of the sanction\u2011policy interaction  \n\n| Date | Key sanction move | Immediate diplomatic signal |\n|------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| **June\u202f2010** | U.S. Treasury\u2019s **Executive Order 13557** \u2013 secondary sanctions on non\u2011U.S. firms dealing in Iran\u2019s oil. | Signals that *any* firm, even outside the U.S., could be penalised. |\n| **Oct\u202f2011** | **EU Council Regulation 267/2012** \u2013 EU bans imports of Iranian crude oil (effective Jan\u202f2012). | First major EU\u2011wide oil embargo; European refiners start to look for alternatives. |\n| **June\u202f2012** | **UN Security Council Resolution 1929** \u2013 adds a UN\u2011mandated oil embargo, freezes assets of designated individuals, bans missile\u2011related exports. | Gives the sanctions **multilateral legitimacy** and forces even neutral states to comply. |\n| **Oct\u202f2012** | **U.S. \u201cPhase\u2011Out\u201d order** \u2013 prohibits U.S. persons from dealing in Iranian crude and petroleum products; also bans most Iranian financial institutions from the U.S. system. | Cuts ~70\u202f% of Iran\u2019s oil export revenues in a single year. |\n| **Nov\u202f2012 \u2013 Jan\u202f2013** | **Secondary sanctions on non\u2011U.S. banks** that continue to process Iranian oil transactions. | Global banks (e.g., HSBC, BNP Paribas) begin to **wind down Iranian business** to avoid losing U.S. market access. |\n| **July\u202f2013** | **Election of President Hassan\u202fRohani** (moderate) \u2013 Iran signals willingness to negotiate. | The sanctioning coalition announces willingness to **lift sanctions** if Iran returns to compliance. |\n| **Nov\u202f2013 \u2013 Jan\u202f2014** | Negotiations in Vienna intensify; **EU\u2011US \u201csnap\u2011back\u201d mechanism** is drafted (",

The procedural chain \u2013 step\u2011by\u2011step  \n\n| Step | Actor | What happens |\n|------|-------|--------------|\n| **1. Detection** | **IAEA** (through inspections, satellite imagery, environmental sampling, etc.) | Issues a *\u201cStatement of Non\u2011Compliance\u201d* (SNC) that describes the specific breach (e.g., enrichment above 3.67\u202f% with a quantity exceeding the JCPOA limit). |\n| **2. Notification** | **Joint Commission** (Iran\u202f+\u202fP5+1) | Receives the SNC, discusses it, and may request clarification. The Joint Commission can also **recommend** a \u201ccorrective action plan.\u201d |\n| **3. Formal determination** | **UN Security Council** (or EU Council, or U.S. President) | Within **30\u202fdays** of the SNC, the Council must vote on a **\u201cre\u2011imposition resolution.\u201d** If no vote occurs (or the vote is vetoed), the sanctions **automatically snap back** per the language of Res.\u202f2231. |\n| **4. Re\u2011imposition** | **UN, EU, U.S.** (each according to its own legal mechanism) | All previously lifted sanctions (oil, financial, missile\u2011related, etc.) are **re\u2011instated** in full. The snap\u2011back is *instantaneous*\u2014there is no need for a new resolution to be drafted, debated, or to achieve the usual 15\u2011vote majority. |\n| **5. \u201cCooling\u2011off\u201d** | **Security Council** (if it wishes) | The Council may adopt a *\u201ctemporary suspension\u201d* of the snap\u2011back for up to 30\u202fdays while diplomatic negotiations try to resolve the breach.
