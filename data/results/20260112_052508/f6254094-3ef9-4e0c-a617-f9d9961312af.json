      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but their effects on **individual workers\u2019 wages and job security** are mixed and highly dependent on:\n\n| Factor | Typical direction of impact | How the factor shapes the outcome |\n|--------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Sector** (export\u2011oriented vs. import\u2011competing) | Export\u2011oriented jobs often see **higher wages** and **more secure employment**; import\u2011competing jobs can face **wage pressure** and **greater turnover** | FTAs lower tariffs on the most\u2011comparatively\u2011advantageous sectors, expanding demand for those workers while exposing others to foreign competition. |\n| **Skill level** (high\u2011skill vs. low\u2011skill) | High\u2011skill workers usually benefit (wage gains, stable jobs); low\u2011skill workers may experience **wage stagnation or decline** and **higher displacement risk** | Trade\u2011induced productivity gains are captured more by workers whose tasks complement new technologies and global value chains. |\n| **Labor\u2011market institutions** (unions, minimum\u2011wage laws, active\u2011labour\u2011market policies) | Strong institutions can **mitigate negative wage/ security effects** and spread gains more evenly. | Institutional \u201cbuffers\u201d (e.g., unemployment insurance, retraining) absorb adjustment costs. |\n| **Country income level** (developed vs. developing) | In high\u2011income countries, FTAs often lead to **wage polarization**; in low\u2011income countries they can raise **average wages** but may increase **precarious\u2011employment** in informal sectors. | The baseline wage structure and the ability to move workers across sectors differ. |\n| **Time horizon** (short\u2011run vs. long\u2011run) | Short\u2011run: **job displacement** and **wage pressure** in vulnerable industries. Long\u2011run: **overall wage growth** and **more stable employment** in expanding sectors, if adjustment policies are in place. | Adjustment costs are front\u2011loaded; gains accrue after reallocation. |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into the evidence, the mechanisms that generate these patterns, and the points where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical mechanisms behind FTA effects on wages & job security  \n\n| Mechanism | What it predicts for workers | Why it matters |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| **Comparative\u2011advantage reallocation** | Workers move from industries where the country has a relative cost disadvantage to those where it has an advantage. Wages rise in expanding sectors, fall (or jobs disappear) in contracting ones. | The core of trade theory (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin, Ricardo) \u2013 the \u201cwinner\u2011loser\u201d pattern. |\n| **Skill\u2011biased technological change (SBTC)** | Trade often brings in new capital equipment and ICT that complement high\u2011skill labor, raising their marginal product (and wages). Low\u2011skill labor may be substituted, lowering wages. | Empirically, many FTAs coincide with technology diffusion. |\n| **Increased market size & competition** | Larger export markets can raise demand for labor, pushing wages up in export\u2011oriented firms. Competition can also force firms to cut costs, sometimes lowering wages or using more contract work. | Export\u2011oriented firms typically pay more than domestically\u2011focused firms. |\n| **Labor\u2011market frictions** | If workers cannot easily move (geographic, skill, or institutional barriers), displaced workers may accept lower wages or insecure contracts. | The speed and cost of reallocation shape short\u2011run pain. |\n| **Institutional spillovers** | Strong unions, minimum\u2011wage laws, or active labour\u2011market policies can raise the floor for wages and protect job security, even in sectors exposed to import competition. | Institutions determine how gains are shared. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**  \n- **Average\u2011case:**  In most empirical work, free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are associated with **small\u2011to\u2011moderate gains in real wages** and **modest net job creation** for the economy as a whole, but the distribution of those gains is highly uneven.  \n- **Distributional side\u2011effects:**  Workers in **import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill sectors** often face **wage pressure or job loss**, while workers in **export\u2011oriented, higher\u2011skill sectors** tend to see **wage rises and better job security**.  \n- **Key moderators:**  The size of the effect depends on a country\u2019s **development level**, **labor\u2011market institutions** (unions, unemployment insurance, active\u2011labour\u2011market policies), **the depth of the agreement** (tariff cuts vs. regulatory harmonisation), and **whether the FTA includes enforceable labour\u2011rights clauses**.\n\nBelow is a systematic synthesis of the **strongest evidence from all major research perspectives**, with clear notes on where expert consensus lies, where debate persists, and where the evidence is still thin.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
