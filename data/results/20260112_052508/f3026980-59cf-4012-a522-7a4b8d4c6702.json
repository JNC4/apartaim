      "unknown_model_response": "### A Recent Raw\u2011Milk Outbreak (2022\u20112023)\n\n| Year | State | Farm / Distributor | Pathogen | Number of Ill Cases | Hospitalizations | Outcome |\n|------|-------|--------------------|----------|---------------------|------------------|---------|\n| 2022 | Texas | Small\u2011scale family dairy (identified by the Texas Department of State Health Services) | **Campylobacter jejuni** | 12 confirmed, 4 probable | 3 | All recovered |\n| 2023 | Washington | Cooperative raw\u2011milk producer (investigated by the Washington State Department of Health) | **E.\u202fcoli O157:H7** | 7 confirmed | 2 | No deaths; all recovered |\n\n**What happened?**  \nIn both incidents, the raw milk was sold directly to consumers at the farm\u2019s \u201con\u2011site\u201d store and at a few local farmers\u2011markets. Laboratory testing of the milk after the illness reports revealed the presence of the offending pathogen at levels far above the safety thresholds recommended by public\u2011health authorities. The farms were subsequently placed under a temporary production halt while they implemented corrective actions and underwent re\u2011inspection.\n\n**Why the outbreak occurred:**  \n\n| Factor | How it contributed |\n|--------|--------------------|\n| **Insufficient pasteurisation** (by definition raw milk is never heat\u2011treated) | Pathogenic bacteria that can survive in the udder or the milking environment remain viable in the final product. |\n| **Inadequate on\u2011farm hygiene** | Poor hand\u2011washing, contaminated milking equipment, and inadequate cleaning of the storage tank allowed bacteria to multiply. |\n| **Lack of routine pathogen testing** | The farms relied mainly on visual inspection and basic somatic\u2011cell counts, which do not detect *E.\u202fcoli* or *Campylobacter*. |\n| **Cross\u2011contamination during transport** | Unsterilized bulk containers and trucks introduced additional microbes. |\n\n---\n\n## How Farms Test Raw Milk to Keep It \u201cSafe\u201d\n\nAlthough the above outbreaks demonstrate that raw milk can harbor dangerous microbes, many raw\u2011milk producers employ a rigorous testing regimen to minimize risk. Below is a typical workflow used by farms that market raw milk responsibly:\n\n| Step | Description | Typical Frequency |\n|------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **1. Bulk\u2011Tank Sampling** | A sterile sample (\u2248\u202f100\u202fmL) is drawn from the bulk storage tank before each daily bottling run. | **Every day** (or each milking shift for larger operations) |\n| **2. Total Plate Count (TPC)** | Measures the overall bacterial load (CFU/mL). Low counts (<\u202f100,000\u202fCFU/mL) are a sign of good hygiene. | Daily |\n| **3. Somatic\u2011Cell Count (SCC)** | Indicates udder health; high SCC (>\u202f200,000\u202fcells/mL) can signal mastitis, which often brings pathogens into the milk. | Daily, plus a weekly composite test |\n| **4. Pathogen\u2011Specific PCR / Culture** | Targeted assays for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Salmonella spp.*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, and *Staphylococcus aureus*. Many farms use rapid PCR panels that deliver results within 4\u20136\u202fhours. | **At least twice per week**; some farms test every batch. |\n| **5. Coliform Test** | Coliforms are indicator organisms for post\u2011milking contamination. | Daily |\n| **6. Rapid ATP\u2011Bioluminescence** | Checks for residual organic matter on equipment and in the milk. | Before each milking session |\n| **7. Temperature Monitoring** | Continuous logging of bulk\u2011tank temperature (must stay \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C). | Continuous, with alerts if temperature rises above threshold |\n| **8. Record\u2011Keeping & Traceability** | All test results are logged in",

When the match is found, the source is usually a single farm or a small network of \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d operations.  \n* **Regulatory outcome:** In each case the farm was required to cease raw\u2011milk sales, undergo a formal corrective\u2011action plan, and (in the U.S.) submit to a **\u201chazard\u2011analysis and critical\u2011control\u2011point\u201d (HACCP) audit** before any future sales could be considered.\n\n---\n\n## How \u201ctesting on farms\u201d is supposed to keep raw milk safe  \n\n### 1.
