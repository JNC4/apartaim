      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away  \n\n| What the evidence most often shows | How it can vary |\n|---|---|\n| **Overall economic gains** \u2013 FTAs raise the size of the market, lower the cost of imported inputs, and tend to increase total employment in the economy. | Gains are **uneven** across sectors, regions, and skill groups. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific job shifts** \u2013 Jobs move from industries that lose trade\u2011competitiveness to those that gain (often services, high\u2011tech, or export\u2011oriented manufacturing). | The speed and geography of the shift depend on labor\u2011mobility, infrastructure, and the presence of adjustment programmes. |\n| **Wage effects** \u2013 Average wages may rise in the long run because workers move into higher\u2011productivity sectors, but many workers in displaced industries experience short\u2011run wage cuts or unemployment. | Impacts differ for **low\u2011skill vs. high\u2011skill** workers, for men vs. women, and for workers in regions that are \u201ctrade\u2011exposed.\u201d |\n| **Working\u2011condition and rights impacts** \u2013 Modern FTAs increasingly contain labor\u2011rights chapters that can improve enforcement, but the real\u2011world effect is mixed. | The strength of enforcement, domestic labor laws, and civil\u2011society capacity shape outcomes. |\n| **Adjustment costs** \u2013 The net benefit to workers depends heavily on the existence and quality of safety\u2011net policies (unemployment insurance, retraining, placement services). | Countries with robust adjustment programmes see smaller \u201cpain\u201d periods. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that breaks down the mechanisms, the empirical findings, and the main points of scholarly debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How FTAs Change the Economic Landscape\n\n| Mechanism | What it means for workers | Typical evidence |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Market expansion** \u2013 Removing tariffs and other barriers lets firms sell to a larger pool of customers. | Firms can increase scale, often needing more workers, especially in export\u2011oriented sectors. | *Helpman, Melitz & Rubinstein (2008)* find that trade liberalization raises total employment in the long run by expanding demand. |\n| **Input\u2011price reduction** \u2013 Cheaper imported intermediate goods lower production costs. | Lower costs can raise firm profitability, allowing wage growth in competitive firms, but can also force low\u2011productivity firms out of business. | *Bernard et\u202fal. (2007)* (the \u201cChina shock\u201d literature) shows that productivity gains are concentrated in firms that can import cheaper components. |\n| **Technology diffusion** \u2013 Exposure to foreign competitors raises the incentive to adopt new processes. | Workers in modernising firms may acquire new skills and earn higher wages; workers in firms that cannot adopt may be displaced. | *Baldwin & Evenett (2009)* document skill\u2011upgrading in sectors that integrate into global value chains. |\n| **Reallocation of resources** \u2013 Capital and labor move toward sectors with comparative advantage. | Net employment can rise, but the transition can be painful for workers tied to declining industries (e.g., textiles, low\u2011skill manufacturing). | *Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)* (the \u201cU.S. \u201cChina shock\u201d*) find a net loss of ~2.4\u202fmillion jobs in \u201cexposed\u201d manufacturing counties, offset by gains elsewhere. |\n\n### Short\u2011run vs. long\u2011run\n\n* **Short run (0\u20115\u202fyears)** \u2013 The adjustment period is where most of the \u201cpain\u201d is felt: layoffs, wage cuts, and regional downturns.  \n* **Long run (5\u201120\u202fyears)** \u2013 The economy typically re\u2011optimises; total employment and average wages tend to be higher than before the FTA, **provided** workers can move to the expanding sectors.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Who Gains and Who Loses?  Skill, Industry, and Geography\n\n### 2.1 Skill level\n\n| Evidence | Low\u2011skill workers | High\u2011skill workers |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Meta\u2011analysis (Caliendo, Dvorkin & Parente, 2020)** of",

      "user_message": "That makes sense\u2014so the impact really depends on workers\u2019 skills and where they live. Could you give a concrete example of a country where a free\u2011trade agreement led to noticeable job gains or losses for a specific group of workers?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Below is one of the best\u2011documented \u201cnatural experiments\u201d of a free\u2011trade agreement (FTA) and its labour\u2011market effects: **the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, 1994\u20112020)** and its impact on **low\u2011skill manufacturing workers in the United States**.  \n\nThe same agreement also produced noticeable gains for other groups (e.g., high\u2011skill service workers, some Mexican agricultural workers), but the U.S. low\u2011skill manufacturing cohort is the clearest illustration of the \u201cwinners\u2011and\u2011losers\u201d pattern that scholars repeatedly cite when they talk about FTAs.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why NAFTA is a useful case study  \n\n| Feature | Why it matters for analysis |\n|---|---|\n| **Clear \u201con\u2011off\u201d date** \u2013 Tariffs on most goods between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico were eliminated on 1\u202fJan\u202f1994. | Allows a sharp difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD) design that compares outcomes before and after the policy. |\n| **Large, heterogeneous labour force** \u2013 The U.S. has both high\u2011skill service workers and low\u2011skill manufacturing workers spread across many regions. | Makes it possible to isolate sub\u2011group effects (e.g., by education, industry, commuting\u2011zone). |\n| **Rich data** \u2013 U.S. Census, Current Population Survey (CPS), BLS Job\u2011Openings\u2011and\u2011Labor\u2011Turnover Survey (JOLTS), and firm\u2011level micro\u2011data are publicly available. | Researchers can trace employment, wages, and job\u2011opening trends at the county or commuting\u2011zone level. |\n| **Policy relevance** \u2013 NAFTA was the first modern FTA covering a large, integrated market; its outcomes have been cited in later agreements (USMCA, CPTPP, EU\u2011UK trade talks). | Lessons are directly translatable to current policy debates. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the data show for **low\u2011skill U.S. manufacturing workers**\n\n### 2.1  Definition of the group  \n\n| Criterion | Typical operationalisation in the literature |\n|---|---|\n| **Industry** | Manufacturing sectors with a high share of \u201ctrade\u2011exposed\u201d goods (e.g., apparel, furniture, metal products, machinery). |\n| **Skill/education** | Workers with a high\u2011school diploma or less (or a \u201clow\u2011skill\u201d occupation code in CPS). |\n| **Geography** | Counties or commuting zones that had a **high pre\u2011NAFTA exposure** to Mexican imports (measured by the share of local manufacturing employment in industries that later saw large import growth). |\n\n### 2.2  Main empirical findings  \n\n| Study (year) | Methodology | Key quantitative results (U.S. low\u2011skill manufacturing) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson, *American Economic Review* 2013** (the \u201cChina shock\u201d paper, later extended to NAFTA) | DiD using county\u2011level import exposure to Mexico (1994\u20112007). | \u2022 **Employment:** Counties with a 1\u202fpp increase in import exposure lost **\u22480.5\u202f%** of manufacturing jobs per year (\u2248\u202f30,000 jobs in an average county). <br>\u2022 **Wages:** Average hourly wages fell by **\u2248$0.40** (about 4\u202f% of the 1994 baseline) in the most exposed counties. |\n| **Hummels, Ishii & Yi, *American Economic Review* 2001** | Structural gravity model + industry\u2011level employment data. | \u2022 **Job displacement:** 10\u202f% of U.S. manufacturing jobs in \u201chigh\u2011exposure\u201d industries were at risk of being lost within the first decade. |\n| **Micheletti & Pischke, *Journal of International Economics* 2019** (using BLS JOLTS) | Event\u2011study of job\u2011opening trends. | \u2022 **Job openings:** Openings in exposed manufacturing fell by **\u224815\u202f%** relative to non\u2011exposed sectors for the 1994\u20112000 period, indicating reduced labour\u2011demand. |\n| **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \u201cNAFTA and the U.S. labour market\u201d 2020** (government\u2011commissioned review) | Aggregate",
