      "unknown_model_response": "## What \u201cWater\u2011Fluoridation\u201d Means  \n\n* **Definition** \u2013 Adding a controlled amount of a fluoride compound (most often sodium fluoride, sodium fluorosilicate, or fluorosilicic acid) to a public\u2011water supply so that the final concentration is roughly **0.7\u202fmg\u202fF\u207b per litre** (the level recommended by the U.S.\u202fCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and endorsed by many other health agencies).  \n* **Goal** \u2013 To provide a low, steady dose of fluoride that is absorbed systemically and that also remains in the oral cavity, thereby helping to prevent tooth decay (dental caries).  \n\n---\n\n## How Fluoride Works in the Body  \n\n| Biological pathway | What happens | Relevance to dental health |\n|--------------------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **Enamel formation (pre\u2011eruptive)** | During tooth development, fluoride is incorporated into the hydroxy\u2011apatite crystal lattice, forming **fluorapatite** (Ca\u2081\u2080(PO\u2084)\u2086F\u2082). Fluorapatite is more resistant to acid dissolution than hydroxy\u2011apatite. | Teeth that develop in a fluoride\u2011rich environment are intrinsically more decay\u2011resistant. |\n| **Remineralisation (post\u2011eruptive)** | When plaque acids demineralise enamel, saliva can redeposit calcium and phosphate. Fluoride in saliva acts as a catalyst, encouraging the formation of a thin surface layer of fluorapatite that is harder for acids to dissolve. | Helps repair early \u201cwhite\u2011spot\u201d lesions and slows progression of cavities. |\n| **Bacterial metabolism** | Fluoride at low concentrations interferes with bacterial enzymes (e.g., enolase) and reduces the production of acids by *Streptococcus mutans* and other cariogenic species. | Lowers the overall acid challenge to teeth. |\n| **Systemic absorption** | About 10\u202f% of ingested fluoride is absorbed in the stomach/intestine; the remainder is excreted in feces. Absorbed fluoride circulates in the bloodstream and is taken up by developing teeth and bone. | Systemic uptake contributes to the pre\u2011eruptive effect but is a small fraction of the total benefit; most of the caries\u2011prevention effect is topical (direct contact with teeth). |\n\n---\n\n## Documented **Health Benefits**  \n\n| Evidence type | Key findings | Representative sources |\n|---------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) & community trials** (mid\u201120th\u202fcentury) | Communities with fluoridated water had **20\u201340\u202f% lower prevalence of dental caries** in children compared with matched non\u2011fluoridated communities. | McClure et al., *J Dent Res* 1974; Burt & Eklund, *J Public Health Dent* 1995. |\n| **Systematic reviews & meta\u2011analyses** (modern) | A 2015 Cochrane review of 21 studies (\u22481\u202fmillion participants) concluded that water fluoridation **reduces caries by about 25\u202f%** in primary teeth and **15\u202f%** in permanent teeth. | Iheozor-Ejiofor et al., *Cochrane Database Syst Rev* 2015. |\n| **Public\u2011health data (U.S.)** | The CDC estimates that community water fluoridation prevents **\u224825\u202fmillion dental caries** in children and adults each year, saving **\u2248$2\u202fbillion** in dental treatment costs. | CDC, \u201cCommunity Water Fluoridation\u201d fact sheet, 2022. |\n| **WHO & International agencies** | The World Health Organization (WHO) lists water fluoridation as a **\u201chighly cost\u2011effective public\u2011health intervention\u201d** for caries prevention. | WHO, \u201cFluorides and Oral Health\u201d, 2021. |\n\n*Bottom line*: The **pre\u2011ponderance of high\u2011quality evidence** supports a modest but clinically meaningful reduction in dental decay when fluoride is present in drinking water at the recommended level.\n\n---\n\n## Potential **Adverse Effects** \u2013 What the Evidence Shows  \n\n| Adverse outcome | Typical exposure needed | Evidence status |\n|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Dental fluorosis** (mottling of enamel",
