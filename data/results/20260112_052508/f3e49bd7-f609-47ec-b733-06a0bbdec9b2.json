The amount may be flat\u2011rate or tiered by caliber, type, or condition. | Some jurisdictions offer higher payments for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles) or for guns that are not registered. |\n| **Eligibility** | Open to any resident who legally possesses a firearm, though some programs restrict participation to people who have not been convicted of certain felonies. | A few buy\u2011backs limit participation to residents of a specific zip code, to a particular demographic (e.g., veterans), or to owners who voluntarily surrender **all** guns they own. |\n| **Logistics** | A single\u2011day \u201cevent\u201d at a police station, community center, or school where people bring guns, receive the incentive, and the weapons are turned over to law\u2011enforcement for destruction (usually shredding or melting). | Ongoing \u201cdrop\u2011box\u201d sites, mobile vans that travel to neighborhoods, or \u201cmail\u2011in\u201d schemes (rare, due to legal restrictions). |\n| **Data collection** | Some programs record make, model, caliber, and serial\u2011number status; many do not. | More rigorous programs partner with academic researchers to evaluate outcomes. |\n| **Legal backdrop** | In the U.S., the National Firearms Act and state laws require that transferred firearms be logged; buy\u2011backs are treated as **voluntary surrender** rather than a purchase, so the transaction is not a \u201csale.\u201d | In countries with universal registration (e.g., Australia, New Zealand) the process can be linked to existing databases, making follow\u2011up easier. |\n\n**Why the design matters**  \nThe effectiveness of a buy\u2011back depends on:\n\n1. **Who turns in guns** \u2013 Are they weapons that would otherwise be stored safely, sold illegally, or used in a crime?  \n2. **What happens to the surrendered guns** \u2013 Immediate destruction eliminates the supply, but if the same owners later acquire new guns the net effect may be small.  \n3. **Scale and frequency** \u2013 A single weekend event that collects a few hundred guns in a city of millions will have a different impact than a sustained, city\u2011wide program that removes thousands each year.  \n\n---\n\n## What does the research say?\n\n### 1.

      "unknown_model_response": "### How the 1996 Australian gun\u2011buy\u2011back translated into a sharp fall in firearm\u2011related suicides  \n\n| Piece of the program | What was done | Why it matters for suicide |\n|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------|\n| **Legal framework \u2013 the National Firearms Agreement (NFA)** | \u2022 Banned semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and pump\u2011action shotguns (the \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons most often used in Australian suicides). <br>\u2022 Required all existing firearms to be **registered** and owners to obtain a licence that included a genuine \u201cgenuine reason\u201d test (self\u2011defence no longer accepted). | By removing the most lethal, rapid\u2011fire guns from private possession, the *case\u2011fatality* of a suicide attempt fell dramatically. Even if a person still owned a gun, the odds that it was a high\u2011capacity weapon were much lower. |\n| **Massive, time\u2011limited buy\u2011back** | \u2022 10\u2011day \u201camnesty\u201d (1\u201310\u202fMay\u202f1996) during which owners could hand in prohibited weapons **free of charge** and receive a cash voucher. <br>\u2022 Voucher amounts were set to the market value of the weapon (\u2248\u202fAU$300\u2013$1\u202f200 per rifle, lower for pistols). <br>\u2022 The government allocated **AU$1\u202fbillion** (\u2248\u202fUS$650\u202fm at today\u2019s exchange) to fund the scheme. | The large, one\u2011off cash incentive removed **\u2248\u202f650\u202f000** prohibited firearms (about 15\u202f% of the civilian stock). Because the program was publicized as a *national duty* and tied to the tragedy that sparked it, many owners who might otherwise have kept a gun for sport or collection turned it in. |\n| **Targeted outreach & community involvement** | \u2022 Nationwide media campaign (\u201cGive up your gun \u2013 help save lives\u201d). <br>\u2022 Town\u2011hall meetings, radio call\u2011ins, and printed ads in rural\u2011area newspapers where most firearms are kept. <br>\u2022 Partnerships with hunting clubs, shooting\u2011range operators, and farm bureaus to legitimize surrender and reassure owners that the process was safe, confidential and legally protected. | Rural and regional communities own the bulk of shotguns and rifles. By speaking directly to those groups, the program reduced the stigma of surrender and increased participation among the very people most likely to own a lethal weapon. |\n| **Immediate destruction of surrendered guns** | All surrendered firearms were **de\u2011activated and melted** within weeks of collection; serial numbers were recorded and then destroyed. | Guarantees that the weapons could not re\u2011enter the market, eliminating a direct supply channel for suicide. |\n| **Follow\u2011up licensing & safe\u2011storage rules** | \u2022 After the buy\u2011back, licences for the remaining legal firearms required a \u201cgenuine reason\u201d (e.g., sport shooting, hunting). <br>\u2022 Mandatory safe\u2011storage standards (locked cabinets, separate ammunition storage) were introduced. | Even for the guns that remained, the added barriers (licence justification, storage costs) make impulsive access less likely\u2014an important factor in suicide, which often occurs within minutes of the decision. |\n\n---\n\n## What the evidence tells us about the suicide impact  \n\n| Study | Data source & method | Key numbers |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------|\n| **Chapman, Alpers, & Jones (2006). \u201cAustralian firearm homicide and suicide rates before and after the 1996 reforms.\u201d *JAMA* 295: 562\u2011569** | National death\u2011certificate data (1990\u20112004).
