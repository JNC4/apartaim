The firearm is recorded, de\u2011identified, and handed to law\u2011enforcement or a licensed destroyer. | Guarantees anonymity, which encourages participation and prevents fear of prosecution for legal owners. |\n| **3.\u202fDestruction or safe\u2011storage redistribution** | The collected guns are either destroyed (e.g., shredded, melted) or, in some programs, refurbished and donated to law\u2011enforcement or \u201csafe\u2011use\u201d groups. | Reduces the *stock* of readily accessible firearms in the community. |\n| **4.\u202fFollow\u2011up data collection** | Organizers may track the number of guns collected, their type (handgun, rifle, etc.), and sometimes basic demographics (age, gender) of participants. | Provides a metric of \u201cinput\u201d (guns removed) that can be compared with trends in gun\u2011related injuries or deaths. |\n\n**Primary hypothesis:**  \nIf you take a sufficient number of firearms\u2014especially those most likely to be used in impulsive acts (handguns, cheap \u201cSaturday night specials,\u201d or guns owned by people at high risk for suicide)\u2014the *probability* that a future homicide, suicide, or accidental discharge will involve a gun that would otherwise have been in the community falls.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fThe empirical record \u2013 what the data actually show  \n\n### 2.1\u202fKey outcomes researchers look at  \n\n| Outcome | Why it matters | Typical data sources |\n|---------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **Homicide rates** (overall & gun\u2011specific) | Direct measure of lethal interpersonal violence. | FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), CDC WONDER, national crime surveys. |\n| **Suicide rates** (overall & gun\u2011specific) | Guns are the most lethal means for suicide; removing access can lower case\u2011fatality. | CDC WONDER mortality files, coroner/medical examiner reports. |\n| **Non\u2011fatal firearm injuries** (e.g., emergency\u2011department visits) | Captures \u201cnear\u2011misses\u201d and the burden on health\u2011care system. | National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), state trauma registries. |\n| **Firearm circulation metrics** (e.g., number of registered guns, background\u2011check volume) | Helps gauge whether the program actually reduced the pool of guns. | ATF National Tracing Center, state licensing databases. |\n\n### 2.2\u202fWhat the strongest studies have found  \n\n| Study (year, location) | Design | Main findings on gun\u2011related outcomes | Limitations noted by authors |\n|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Australia \u2013 National Firearms Amnesty & 1996 \u201cGun Buy\u2011Back\u201d (Bendiksen et\u202fal., 2020)** | Population\u2011level before\u2011after (1995\u20112005) with time\u2011series analysis. | ~650,000 firearms (\u223c20\u202f% of handguns) surrendered; firearm homicide fell from 0.9 to 0.5 per 100\u202fk; firearm suicide fell from 2.4 to 1.2 per 100\u202fk. | No control group; other reforms (licensing, restrictions) implemented simultaneously. |\n| **Seattle, WA, 1992\u20111995 \u201cGun Buy\u2011Back\u201d (Cook & Ludwig, 2000)** | Quasi\u2011experimental (difference\u2011in\u2011differences with comparable cities). | 4,400 guns collected; no statistically significant change in Seattle\u2019s homicide or suicide rates relative to control cities. | Small sample size; limited follow\u2011up (2\u202fyears); possible \u201cleakage\u201d of guns to other jurisdictions.",

The NYC effort is often cited as \u201cone of the most successful modern municipal buy\u2011backs\u201d because it combined a *large\u2011scale, well\u2011publicized collection* with *rigorous, publicly released evaluation* and *concurrent policy levers* (safe\u2011storage laws and expanded \u201cextreme\u2011risk\u2011protection\u2011order\u201d use).\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3  Program design & implementation  \n\n| Element | What NYC did | Why it matters for impact |\n|---------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **Funding** | **$13\u202fmillion** from the city budget (allocated in FY\u202f2019). | Sizable cash pool allowed generous incentives and many collection sites. |\n| **Incentive structure** | \u2022 **$250 cash** per handgun, **$150** per rifle/shotgun.<br>\u2022 **$100** per \u201chigh\u2011capacity magazine\u201d (\u226510 rounds).<br>\u2022 Bonus **$50** for participants who also signed a **voluntary safe\u2011storage pledge** (keep any remaining guns locked). | Higher payouts for the weapon types most linked to homicide and mass\u2011shootings; the safe\u2011storage pledge created a behavioral nudge beyond simply removing a gun. |\n| **Anonymity & legal immunity** | Full **amnesty** for any firearm turned in, even if it was unregistered or previously involved in a crime.
