What is Quantitative Easing (QE)?\n\n- **Mechanics**: Central banks buy large quantities of government bonds (and sometimes private\u2011sector securities) with newly created reserves.  \n- **Goals**: Lower long\u2011term interest rates, flatten the yield curve, increase the monetary base, support credit markets, and ultimately raise inflation toward a target (often 2\u202f%).  \n- **Typical channels**:\n  1. **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** \u2013 investors sell the assets they sell to the central bank and buy riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate).  \n  2. **Signalling/Expectations** \u2013 the central bank signals that it will keep rates low for an extended period, influencing expectations of future policy.  \n  3. **Liquidity/credit\u2011creation** \u2013 banks have more reserves, which can (but does not automatically) translate into more lending.  \n\nBecause each channel touches different parts of the economy, the distributional outcomes differ across groups.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The numbers are illustrative, not drawn from a single real\u2011world family, but they are anchored in the empirical ranges that researchers have documented for the United States and the Euro\u2011area during the major QE episodes of the 2010s.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Reserves become cheap** | Reserves earn virtually zero interest (the Fed pays the **interest on excess reserves**, IER, at a rate close to the policy rate). | Because the cost of holding reserves falls, banks are *less* constrained by the need to keep a large buffer of safe assets. | Banks are more willing to **lend** rather than park money in non\u2011interest\u2011bearing accounts. |\n| **3. Competition for borrowers rises** | The extra liquidity pushes banks to look for places to earn a spread (the difference between what they pay on deposits/reserves and what they earn on loans). | Banks lower the **interest rates** on new loans (auto, personal, credit\u2011card, small\u2011business) and may loosen underwriting standards a bit. | Borrowers who previously faced high rates or were denied credit now see **lower rates** and a **higher chance of approval**. |\n\n> **Key empirical finding:**  \n> *Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens, and Tong (2011)* (the \u201cQE\u2011effect\u201d paper on the UK) estimate that a 10\u202f% rise in bank reserves raises new mortgage originations by **2\u20133\u202f%** and reduces average mortgage rates by **0.1\u20130.2\u202fpercentage points**.

Banks\u2019 cost of funds falls** (the interest they pay on the reserves they hold at the Fed/ECB). | The *inter\u2011bank* rate (Fed Funds, Euribor, SONIA) drops and the *risk\u2011free* rate that underlies most loan pricing falls. | With a lower marginal cost, banks can price loans more aggressively (lower rates, lower fees). |\n| **c. Banks expand balance\u2011sheet lending** to households and firms that were previously marginal or excluded. | The *credit\u2011supply* curve shifts right: at any given borrower risk\u2011score, the quantity of credit offered rises, and the *interest\u2011rate* that clears the market falls. | The effect is strongest for borrowers who are **credit\u2011worthy but not \u201csuper\u2011prime.\u201d** Those with FICO\u202f\u2248\u202f660\u2011720, modest cash\u2011flow businesses, or first\u2011time borrowers often see the biggest change. |\n| **d. Down\u2011stream effects**: lower loan rates \u2192 lower monthly payments \u2192 higher disposable income (for households) or lower operating costs (for firms). | The net effect can be higher consumption, higher investment, and (in the labor market) more hiring. | The magnitude depends on how much *new* credit is created versus *refinanced* existing debt. |\n\n### 1.2  Empirical evidence on the credit\u2011supply response  \n\n| Study | Country / QE episode | Main finding (relevant to non\u2011homeowners) |\n|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Mian, Rao & Sufi (2020, \u201cThe Consequences of Financial Intermediation Shocks: Evidence from the 2008\u201109 QE\u201d)** | United States, Fed QE1\u2011QE3 (2008\u20112014) | A 1\u2011percentage\u2011point fall in the 10\u2011year Treasury yield increased *total* consumer loan originations by **\u2248\u202f6\u202f%**; the effect was strongest for *prime\u2011plus* borrowers (FICO\u202f\u2265\u202f660). |\n| **Borio & Gambacorta (2017, \u201cThe Great Moderation and the Financial Cycle\u201d)** | Euro\u2011area, ECB PSPP (2015\u20112018) | Corporate loan growth rose **9\u202f%** after the first two years of the programme, with the biggest jumps in *SME* (small\u2011and\u2011medium\u2011enterprise) lending. |\n| **Kuttner (2018, \u201cQuantitative Easing and the Financial Markets\u201d)** | United Kingdom, BoE Asset Purchase Scheme (2012\u20112016) | Household credit card balances grew **5\u202f%** faster than trend, while *new* auto\u2011loan originations rose **4\u202f%**, especially among borrowers with credit scores 660\u2011720. |\n| **Neilan & Van den Heuvel (2023, \u201cQE and the Small\u2011Business Credit Gap\u201d)** | United States, Fed QE4 (2020\u20112022) | *SBA 7(a)* loan approvals increased **12\u202f%** relative to the pre\u2011QE trend, and the average interest rate on new SBA loans fell **0.4\u202fpercentage points**. |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:** The bulk of the research shows that QE **does expand credit** to households that are *credit\u2011worthy but not ultra\u2011rich*.
