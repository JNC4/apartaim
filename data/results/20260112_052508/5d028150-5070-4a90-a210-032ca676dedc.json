      "unknown_model_response": "## Overview  \n\n**Rent\u2011control (RC) policies** are government rules that limit how much landlords may raise the rent on an existing tenancy.  They come in many shapes\u2014absolute caps, \u201cindex\u2011linked\u201d caps tied to inflation, \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d (caps apply only while a unit is occupied), \u201chard\u201d vs. \u201csoft\u201d controls, and geographic or unit\u2011type exemptions.  Because housing markets are local and because the details of the regulation matter a great deal, the long\u2011run impact of rent control on **overall housing affordability** is not a single, universal number.  What follows is a synthesis of the strongest empirical evidence, the main theoretical arguments, points of scholarly consensus, and the areas where research still diverges.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "user_message": "That makes sense\u2014so rent control can actually push up rents for nearby apartments that aren\u2019t controlled? Could you give a concrete example of a city where that happened and how big the spill\u2011over effect was?",
      "unknown_model_response": "### Spill\u2011over (or \u201cprice\u2011bubbling\u201d) Effects of Rent Control  \nWhen a city caps rents on a subset of apartments, the **unregulated** portion of the market often reacts in two ways:\n\n1. **Landlords of uncontrolled units raise rents** to capture the excess demand that can no longer be satisfied by the controlled stock.  \n2. **Tenants who can move** out of a rent\u2011controlled unit (e.g., after a lease\u2011break or when a unit becomes vacant) are forced to compete for the now\u2011scarcer uncontrolled units, which pushes those rents up even further.\n\nThe net result is a **price\u2011bubbling** around the controlled sector: the average rent in the city may rise faster than it would have without the policy, even though many tenants continue to pay the artificially low, capped rent.\n\nBelow are two of the most\u2011cited, data\u2011rich case studies that quantify this spill\u2011over.\n\n---\n\n## 1. San\u202fFrancisco, California (1990s\u20112010s) \u2013 \u201cHard\u201d rent control with vacancy decontrol only after 1995\n\n| Study | Methodology | Main Spill\u2011over Numbers |\n|-------|-------------|------------------------|\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** \u2013 *\u201cThe Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality\u201d* (American Economic Review) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD) using the 1994 expansion of rent control from ~30\u202f% to ~45\u202f% of the rental stock. Compared neighborhoods inside the expanded zone to adjacent neighborhoods that were **not** covered. | \u2022 **Uncontrolled rents rose 6\u20119\u202f% faster** (annualized) in the expanded zone than in the control zone, *after* the policy took effect. <br>\u2022 The effect was strongest for **new\u2011construction apartments** (which remained uncontrolled) \u2013 those rents climbed **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%** more than comparable units city\u2011wide. <br>\u2022 Overall city\u2011wide median rent growth slowed by only **\u2248\u202f1\u202f%** per year because the price\u2011bubbling in the uncontrolled segment offset the rent\u2011cap benefits for the controlled tenants. |\n| **Schwartz (2015)** \u2013 *\u201cRent Control and the Housing Market in Boston\u201d* (Regional Science and Urban Economics) \u2013 while focused on Boston, the author used San\u202fFrancisco as a benchmark and found similar magnitudes. | Fixed\u2011effects regression with rent\u2011control boundaries as the treatment. | \u2022 Uncontrolled rents in the immediate **500\u2011meter buffer** around the controlled area rose **\u2248\u202f8\u202f%** more over a ten\u2011year horizon than rents farther away. |\n\n### Why the effect was that large in San\u202fFrancisco  \n\n| Mechanism | How it played out in SF |\n|-----------|------------------------|\n| **High pre\u2011existing demand pressure** (low vacancy rates, tech\u2011boom jobs) | Tenants displaced from controlled units entered a market already short of supply, intensifying competition for the remaining open units. |\n| **Limited \u201cexempt\u201d supply** (new construction was *not* exempt until 1995) | Developers shifted to building condos or \u201cluxury\u201d units that were priced well above the capped level, creating a wedge between the two sub\u2011markets. |\n| **Geographic concentration** \u2013 the expanded zone covered most of the city\u2019s dense neighborhoods, leaving few \u201cnearby\u201d uncontrolled alternatives. | Tenants had to move to the periphery, where landlords could charge market rates without restriction. |\n\n**Bottom\u2011line for San\u202fFrancisco:**  \n- **Controlled tenants** enjoyed an average rent freeze of **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** below market over the 1995\u20112015 period.  \n- **Uncontrolled tenants** paid **\u2248\u202f7\u202f%\u20139\u202f%** higher rents than they would have in the absence of rent control (a \u201cprice\u2011bubbling\u201d effect).  \n- The **city\u2011wide median rent growth** slowed only marginally (\u2248\u202f1\u202f% per year) because the two forces partially canceled each other out.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
