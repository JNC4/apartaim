      "unknown_model_response": "**Why doctors recommend childhood vaccines \u2013 the core reasons**\n\n| Reason | What it means for the child and the community | Key evidence |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Direct protection against serious disease** | A vaccine trains the immune system to recognise a pathogen without causing the disease, so if the child is later exposed the infection is prevented or dramatically milder. | Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and decades of observational data show >90\u202f% efficacy for most routine childhood vaccines (e.g., measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR), diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis (DTaP), polio). |\n| **Prevention of complications, disability, and death** | Many vaccine\u2011preventable diseases can cause pneumonia, encephalitis, permanent hearing loss, paralysis, miscarriage, or death. | Example: In the United States, before the measles vaccine, ~500\u202fdeaths and >100\u202f000 hospitalisations occurred each year (CDC, 1990). After universal vaccination, deaths dropped to <1 per year. |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | When a high proportion of people are immune, the pathogen has few susceptible hosts and transmission chains break. This protects those who cannot be vaccinated (infants, immunocompromised, allergic to vaccine components). | Modelling studies and real\u2011world data (e.g., the 2009\u20112010 H1N1 pandemic) show that a 90\u201195\u202f% coverage threshold for measles stops sustained community spread. |\n| **Eradication and control of diseases** | Successful vaccination campaigns have eliminated smallpox globally and brought polio to the brink of eradication; they have reduced pertussis, Hib meningitis, and rotavirus disease to historic lows. | WHO certification of smallpox eradication (1980); Global Polio Eradication Initiative reports >99\u202f% reduction in polio cases since 1988. |\n| **Economic and social benefits** | Fewer doctor visits, hospitalisations, and long\u2011term disabilities translate into lower health\u2011care costs, fewer missed school days, and greater parental productivity. | Cost\u2011effectiveness analyses: Every $1 spent on childhood immunisation in the U.S. saves $3\u2011$10 in direct medical costs and $10\u2011$30 in societal costs (CDC, 2019). |\n| **Predictable schedule that fits normal child\u2011care visits** | The routine schedule (e.g., at 2, 4, 6, 12\u201315 months) aligns with well\u2011child check\u2011ups, making it logistically simple for families and providers. | American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and CDC schedule based on optimal timing of immune response and protection. |\n\n---\n\n## How safe are childhood vaccines?  \n\n### 1. **Safety assessment pipeline**\n\n| Stage | What happens | Who oversees it |\n|-------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Pre\u2011clinical** | Laboratory and animal studies test for toxicity, immune response, and dose. | Academic labs, manufacturers, FDA/EMA review. |\n| **Phase\u202fI\u2011III clinical trials** | 1\u202f000\u201330\u202f000 participants (including children when appropriate) receive the vaccine or a placebo. Outcomes: efficacy, common side\u2011effects, serious adverse events. | Independent Data Safety Monitoring Boards + regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA, WHO). |\n| **Regulatory licensure** | Vaccine must meet defined standards for purity, potency, and safety. | FDA (U.S.), EMA (EU), national authorities elsewhere. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure surveillance** | \u2022 **Passive**: VAERS (U.S.), Yellow Card (UK) \u2013 anyone can report. <br>\u2022 **Active**: Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), Sentinel, and WHO\u2019s Global Vaccine Safety Initiative \u2013 systematic chart review of millions of doses. <br>\u2022 **Phase\u202fIV studies**: specific safety questions (e.g., rare neurologic events). | Government health agencies, independent research centres, WHO. |\n| **Periodic safety updates** | Manufacturers submit annual safety reports; agencies can issue new guidance or restrict use if",

However, waning can occur if the series isn\u2019t completed, so boosters are essential. |\n| **After the 2nd dose (\u2248\u202f1\u202fmonth later)** | Titres often exceed 5\u201110\u202f\u00b5g/mL, well above the protective threshold of 0.15\u202f\u00b5g/mL for short\u2011term protection and 1\u202f\u00b5g/mL for long\u2011term protection. | **High\u2011level protection** (>\u202f90\u202f% efficacy). |\n| **After the 3rd dose (\u2248\u202f2\u20113\u202fmonths later)** | Antibody memory is established; titres stay protective for years, especially after the booster at 12\u201115\u202fmonths. | **Near\u2011complete protection** for the first 5\u20117\u202fyears of life. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** A child gets a meaningful reduction in risk against invasive Hib disease within **2\u202fweeks** of the first dose, but the schedule (3\u202fprimary doses\u202f+\u202fbooster) is required to",
