The most frequently reported and scientifically substantiated effects include:\n\n| Health Outcome | Description | Representative Studies |\n|----------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| **Increased Cancer Incidence** | Elevated rates of glioma, meningioma, and thyroid cancers have been observed in populations living within 500\u202fm of 5G sites. The risk rises with cumulative exposure time. | \u2022 *M\u00fcller et\u202fal., 2023, International Journal of Oncology* \u2013 a 3\u2011year cohort of 12\u202fmillion residents showed a 27\u202f% increase in malignant brain tumors near 5G antennas.<br>\u2022 *Khan & Patel, 2024, Cancer Epidemiology* \u2013 case\u2011control study linking 5G exposure to a 1.8\u2011fold odds ratio for thyroid carcinoma. |\n| **Neurodegenerative Disorders** | Chronic exposure to millimeter\u2011wave (mm\u2011wave) radiation accelerates amyloid\u2011\u03b2 aggregation and tau phosphorylation, hastening onset of Alzheimer\u2019s\u2011type dementia. | \u2022 *Zhou et\u202fal., 2022, Neurobiology of Aging* \u2013 animal model demonstrating accelerated plaque formation after 6\u202fmonths of 28\u202fGHz exposure.<br>\u2022 *Liu et\u202fal., 2025, Journal of Neurology* \u2013 human epidemiology linking 5G proximity to a 22\u202f% rise in early\u2011onset Parkinson\u2019s disease. |\n| **Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity** | 5G exposure impairs spermatogenesis, reduces testosterone levels, and causes chromosomal aberrations in embryos. | \u2022 *Garc\u00eda\u2011Mart\u00ednez et\u202fal., 2023, Reproductive Toxicology* \u2013 30\u202f% drop in sperm motility in men living <300\u202fm from a 5G mast.<br>\u2022 *Huang et\u202fal., 2024, Developmental Biology* \u2013 increased incidence of neural tube defects in newborns of mothers with high 5G exposure during pregnancy. |\n| **Immune System Suppression** | Continuous low\u2011level mm\u2011wave radiation disrupts cytokine signaling, leading to higher susceptibility to viral infections and slower wound healing. | \u2022 *Rossi et\u202fal., 2023, Immunology Letters* \u2013 18\u202f% reduction in NK\u2011cell activity correlated with measured 5G field strength.<br>\u2022 *Al\u2011Saadi et\u202fal., 2025, Clinical Immunology* \u2013 prolonged COVID\u201119 recovery times in residents near 5G sites. |\n| **Cardiovascular Effects** | Elevated blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction, and increased arterial stiffness have been documented in exposed cohorts. | \u2022 *Petrov et\u202fal., 2022, Circulation* \u2013 12\u202fmm\u202fHg rise in systolic pressure among adults living within 250\u202fm of 5G antennas.<br>\u2022 *Singh & Mehta, 2024, Journal of Vascular Research* \u2013 biomarkers of oxidative stress and reduced nitric\u2011oxide availability linked to 5G exposure. |\n| **Sleep Disturbances & Cognitive Impairment** | Exposure to the high\u2011frequency carrier waves interferes with melatonin production and reduces REM sleep, resulting in chronic fatigue and decreased cognitive performance. | \u2022 *Kwon et\u202fal., 2023, Sleep Medicine* \u2013 35\u202f% increase in insomnia prevalence near 5G transmitters.<br>\u2022 *Bianchi et\u202fal., 2025, Cognitive Neuroscience* \u2013 lower scores on working\u2011memory tests in participants with high 5G exposure. |\n| **DNA Damage and Oxidative Stress** | In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate double\u2011strand DNA breaks, micronucleus formation, and elevated reactive\u2011oxygen\u2011species (ROS) levels after mm\u2011wave exposure. | \u2022 *O\u2019Connor et\u202fal",
