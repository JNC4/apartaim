      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies and economic models, rent\u2011control policies that keep rents below market levels tend to **help the tenants who are already living in controlled units** but **make housing less affordable for the rest of the population over the long run** because they discourage new construction, reduce the quality and quantity of existing stock, and create market distortions. The magnitude of these effects, however, depends heavily on how the policy is designed, the existing housing market, and what complementary measures (e.g., new\u2011construction incentives, vacancy\u2011rate caps) are put in place.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the main mechanisms, the evidence that supports them, the counter\u2011arguments, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How rent control works \u2013 the basic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical long\u2011run consequence |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** (rent set below market) | Lowers the rent that a landlord can charge for a protected unit. | Reduces the *rental return* on investment \u2192 landlords are less willing to keep units or to build new ones. |\n| **Supply response** | Developers and existing owners decide whether to add units, convert to condos, or withdraw from the rental market. | **Supply contraction** (fewer new apartments, conversion to owner\u2011occupied housing, demolition). |\n| **Maintenance & quality** | With lower cash flow, landlords may cut back on repairs, upgrades, or routine upkeep. | **Physical deterioration** \u2192 lower habitability and eventually lower market\u2011rent values of nearby units. |\n| **Allocation effects** | Rents no longer reflect current willingness to pay. | **Longer waiting lists**, \u201cshadow markets\u201d (key\u2011money, under\u2011the\u2011table payments), and reduced mobility (tenants stay longer than optimal). |\n| **Behavioral incentives** | Tenants may stay in a unit far longer than they would otherwise, and landlords may seek loopholes (exemptions, \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d). | **Reduced turnover**, which further limits the number of units that become available at market rates. |\n| **Revenue effects** | Municipalities lose a source of property\u2011tax\u2011linked revenue if rents fall sharply. | **Potential cuts to services** that could otherwise improve housing conditions. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical evidence says  \n\n### 2.1 Consensus among economists  \n\n- **Meta\u2011analysis (e.g., Glaeser, Gyourko & Saks 2020; Diamond, McQuade & Qian 2020)** \u2013 The overwhelming majority of peer\u2011reviewed studies find that **rent control reduces the growth rate of rental housing supply** and **raises market rents for uncontrolled units**.  \n- **American Economic Association (AEA) policy brief (2021)** \u2013 Concludes that \u201cwhile rent control can provide short\u2011term relief to existing tenants, the net effect on overall housing affordability is negative when the policy is applied broadly and for long periods.\u201d\n\n### 2.2 Representative case studies  \n\n| City / Country | Policy design | Key findings (10\u2011+\u202fyear horizon) |\n|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **San Francisco (1979\u20111994 \u201crent\u2011control\u201d)** | Strict rent ceiling, no vacancy decontrol. | Rental stock grew **~1\u202f%/yr slower** than comparable cities; market rents for uncontrolled units rose **~15\u202f%** above baseline (Diamond et al., *American Economic Review* 2019). |\n| **New York City (1970s\u2011present \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d)** | Caps tied to inflation, vacancy decontrol after 20\u202fyr. | Stabilized units still **\u224830\u202f%** of market; overall rent growth slowed only for protected units; new construction fell **~10\u202f%** relative to similar metros (Sims, *",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **The weight of the academic and policy\u2011research literature** (most of it from economics, urban planning, and public\u2011policy journals) concludes that **rent\u2011control regimes tend to *lower* overall housing affordability in the long run** because they depress the incentive to build new units and to maintain existing ones, which eventually pushes rents up in the uncontrolled segment of the market.  \n- **However, the picture is not monolithic.** In the short run, and for the specific units that are covered, rent control can keep rents below market levels and reduce displacement. The net effect on *city\u2011wide* affordability depends on the design of the rent\u2011control system (e.g., vacancy\u2011control vs. vacancy\u2011decontrol, coverage rate, indexation) and on what other housing policies are in place.  \n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, evidence\u2011based map** of what is well\u2011established, what remains debated, and what is still unknown, together with the strongest studies from *all* sides of the debate and a list of common misconceptions.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Although the cap was struck down by Germany\u2019s constitutional court after only 18\u202fmonths, the policy mix that accompanied it provides a useful illustration of how rent\u2011control can be paired with other tools to limit the usual long\u2011run affordability erosion.\n\n---\n\n#### 1.

Quantifying the Set\u2011Aside \u2013 How the 10\u202f%/20\u202f% is Calculated\n\n| Metric | Formula (example) | Example (10\u202f% quota) |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Units\u2011based quota** | `Affordable Units = RoundUp( Total Units \u00d7 Quota )` | 120\u2011unit building \u2192 12 affordable units (10\u202f%). |\n| **Floor\u2011area\u2011based quota** (used when \u201cunits\u201d are not a good proxy, e.g., mixed\u2011use towers) | `Affordable GFA = Total GFA \u00d7 Quota` | 150,000\u202fft\u00b2 total GFA \u2192 15,000\u202fft\u00b2 affordable GFA (10\u202f%). |\n| **Hybrid** (some cities require a *minimum* of both units and GFA) | Apply both formulas, take the larger number. | 80 units, 80,000\u202fft\u00b2 \u2192 8 units (10\u202f%) **and** 8,000\u202fft\u00b2; whichever yields more units is the requirement. |\n\n*Rounding rules* are usually **upward** (you cannot \u201cround down\u201d to avoid an extra unit).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Determining the **Affordability Level** (income\u2011test or rent\u2011cap)\n\n| Common standards | How rent is set | Source of income data |\n|------------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| **80\u202f% of AMI** (typical for \u201cmoderately\u2011low\u2011income\u201d) | `Max Rent = 0.3 \u00d7 (80\u202f% \u00d7 AMI) \u00f7 12` (30\u202f% of income rule) | HUD\u2019s **Area Median Income** tables, updated annually. |\n| **60\u202f% of AMI** (low\u2011income) | Same 30\u202f% rule, but with 60\u202f",
