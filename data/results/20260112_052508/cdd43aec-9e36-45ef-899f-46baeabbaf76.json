In Australia and Canada the money came from a small surcharge on new firearms licences. | Any firearms that the law permits to be owned (handguns, rifles, shotguns, sometimes air guns). Some programs also accept illegal or unregistered weapons. | The firearms are usually **destroyed** (shredded, melted, or otherwise rendered inoperable). In a few cases they are transferred to museums or law\u2011enforcement evidence pools. |\n\n### Typical design features that vary a lot\n\n| Feature | Common options | Why the choice matters |\n|---------|----------------|------------------------|\n| **Incentive level** | $50\u2011$250 per handgun, $20\u2011$100 per long gun; sometimes higher for \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d weapons. | Higher payments attract more owners, but also raise cost\u2011effectiveness questions. |\n| **Anonymity vs. registration** | Anonymous (most U.S. cities) vs. required ID and serial\u2011number recording (Australia, many Canadian provinces). | Anonymity encourages participation but makes it harder to track whether the guns were previously illegal. |\n| **Scope** | City\u2011wide (e.g., Seattle 1998), state\u2011wide (e.g., New South Wales 1996), national (Australia 1996, Canada 1992\u201193). | Larger geographic reach can capture more guns but requires more coordination and funding. |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events, annual/bi\u2011annual, or rolling \u201cdrop\u2011boxes.\u201d | Repeated events can create a habit of surrendering unwanted weapons, but the impact may diminish over time. |\n| **Targeted weapons** | All firearms, only handguns, only \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d semi\u2011automatics, etc. | Targeting the weapons most associated with homicide or mass shootings can improve relevance to violence\u2011reduction goals. |\n\n---\n\n## What the research says\n\n### 1. Overall consensus\n* **Buy\u2011backs alone are not a \u201csilver bullet.\u201d** The majority of peer\u2011reviewed studies conclude that buy\u2011backs **reduce the number of firearms in a community** but **have modest or uncertain effects on overall gun\u2011homicide, gun\u2011injury, or suicide rates** when they are not paired with other policies (e.g., background checks, safe\u2011storage laws, community\u2011based violence\u2011prevention programs).\n\n### 2. Evidence from the most\u2011studied settings\n\n| Study (year) | Setting | Design | What was measured | Main findings |\n|--------------|---------|--------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Webster & Wintemute 2015** (systematic review) | U.S. city buy\u2011backs (Seattle 1998, Sacramento 2007, New York 2013, etc.) | 13 observational studies, mostly before\u2011after with control cities | Number",

The tragedy sparked a national political consensus that a dramatic change to gun policy was required. |\n| **Legislative package** | The *National Firearms Agreement* (NFA) that accompanied the buy\u2011back included: <br>\u2022 **Ban** on semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and pump\u2011action shotguns; <br>\u2022 **Uniform licensing** (background checks, 28\u2011day waiting period, safe\u2011storage requirements); <br>\u2022 **National firearm\u2011registry**; <br>\u2022 **Strict limits** on handgun calibre and magazine capacity. |\n| **Buy\u2011back mechanics** | \u2022 **Funding:** $0.5\u202fbillion Australian dollars (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$350\u202fM) financed by a temporary levy on new firearm licences. <br>\u2022 **Price schedule:** Up to **A$1,000** per prohibited firearm (handguns up to A$500, rifles and shotguns up to A$1,000) \u2013 well above market value to encourage surrender. <br>\u2022 **Duration:** 6\u2011month nationwide campaign (May\u2013Oct\u202f1996). <br>\u2022 **Collection points:** 1,300 police\u2011run sites plus mobile units in remote areas. <br>\u2022 **Anonymity:** Turn\u2011ins were **not anonymous**; owners gave name, address and serial numbers (recorded in the new registry). |\n| **Volume** | **~650,000 firearms** were surrendered (\u2248\u202f20\u202f% of the pre\u2011NFA civilian stock). This included **~70,000 prohibited semi\u2011automatic rifles/shotguns** and **~200,000 handguns**. |\n| **Destruction** | All surrendered guns were de\u2011commissioned and melted; serial numbers were logged and later used to verify that the same weapons did not re\u2011appear in crime data. |\n\n---\n\n## What the data show\n\n| Outcome | Before NFA (1995) | After NFA (average of 2000\u20112005) | Change | Key source |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------|------------|\n| **Firearm homicide rate** (per 100\u202f000) | 0.78 | 0.19 | **\u201176\u202f%** | *Chapman, Alpers & Alpers 2006; Australian Institute of Criminology* |\n| **Overall homicide rate** (all weapons) | 1.53 | 1.28 | **\u201116\u202f%** (much of the drop came from firearms) | Same |\n| **Firearm suicide rate** (per 100\u202f000) | 2.79 | 1.10 | **\u201161\u202f%** | *Miller et\u202fal., 2002, JAMA* |\n| **Number of firearms recovered in crimes** | 2,148 (1995) | 561 (2003) | **\u201174\u202f%** | *Australian Crime Statistics Agency* |\n| **Estimated number of guns removed per homicide prevented** | \u2014 | ~2.5\u202fguns per homicide prevented (based on regression models) | \u2014 | *Webster & Wintemute 2015, Review of Economics and Statistics* |\n\n**Why the Australian experience stands out**\n\n1. **Comprehensive policy context** \u2013 The buy\u2011back was **not a stand\u2011alone event**.

Owners who could not or did not want to apply for a licence were encouraged to turn their guns in for cash. |\n| **Safe\u2011storage requirement** | **2013**: a law mandating that any firearm in a home where a minor lives be stored **locked and unloaded** or kept in a locked container. Violation can lead to civil liability and criminal penalties. | The safe\u2011storage rule gave the city a second lever to reduce accidental shootings and youth\u2011access suicides, complementing the removal of \u201cunwanted\u201d guns through the buy\u2011back. |\n| **Assault\u2011weapon / high\u2011capacity\u2011magazine ban** | **2013**: D.C. enacted a ban on **semi\u2011automatic rifles, pistols and shotguns** that can accept magazines larger than **10 rounds** (later reduced to 5 rounds after a 2015 court ruling). The ban applied to weapons **already owned**; owners had to **register** them and could **surrender** them for a fee of **$150\u2011$300** per weapon. | The buy\u2011back",
