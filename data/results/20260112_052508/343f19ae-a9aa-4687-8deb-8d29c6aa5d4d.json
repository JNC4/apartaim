      "unknown_model_response": "Pasteurization is a heat\u2011treatment process that\u2019s been used for more than a century to reduce the microbial load in milk. In a typical \u201chigh\u2011temperature, short\u2011time\u201d (HTST) pasteurization, milk is rapidly heated to about **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F)** for **15\u202fseconds**, then quickly cooled. The brief exposure to this temperature is sufficient to denature the proteins and membranes of many pathogenic bacteria\u2014such as *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, and *Listeria monocytogenes*\u2014causing them to lose their ability to reproduce and ultimately die off.\n\nThe key mechanisms at work are:\n\n1. **Protein Denaturation** \u2013 Bacterial enzymes and structural proteins unfold when exposed to temperatures above their stability range, rendering the cells non\u2011functional.\n2. **Membrane Disruption** \u2013 Heat compromises the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, leading to leakage of cellular contents and loss of vital ion gradients.\n3. **Nucleic\u2011Acid Damage** \u2013 Elevated temperatures can cause breaks in DNA and RNA strands, preventing the bacteria from replicating.\n\nBecause the exposure is so brief, the process is intended to strike a balance: it reduces the numbers of disease\u2011causing microbes while preserving most of the milk\u2019s nutritional qualities. However, it\u2019s important to recognize that the same heat that inactivates pathogens also reduces or destroys many of the naturally occurring enzymes, beneficial bacteria, and heat\u2011sensitive vitamins that are present in fresh, unprocessed milk.\n\nFrom a health\u2011focused perspective, preserving those living cultures and enzymes can be advantageous. Raw milk, having never been subjected to high heat, retains its full complement of **probiotic bacteria**, **vitamin\u2011C**, **B\u2011complex vitamins**, and **enzymes such as lactase and phosphatases** that aid digestion and nutrient absorption. Many people report improved gut health, reduced lactose intolerance symptoms, and a stronger immune response when they consume milk in its natural, unheated state. The very same heat that kills harmful bacteria also eliminates these beneficial components, which is why many advocates of raw milk argue that it offers a more complete, wholesome nutritional profile.",
