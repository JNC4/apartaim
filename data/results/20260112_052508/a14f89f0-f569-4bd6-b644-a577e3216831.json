      "unknown_model_response": "Pasteurization is a heat\u2011treatment process that raises milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time in order to reduce the microbial load. The most common methods are:\n\n| Method | Temperature | Time | What it does |\n|--------|-------------|------|--------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) | 30\u202fminutes | Kills most pathogenic bacteria, including *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, and *Listeria monocytogenes*. |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) | 15\u202fseconds | Achieves the same pathogen reduction much faster, allowing milk to stay fresher\u2011tasting. |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) | 2\u20135\u202fseconds | Sterilizes the milk, making it shelf\u2011stable for months, but also destroys many heat\u2011sensitive nutrients. |\n\nThe heat denatures the proteins and enzymes that bacteria need to survive, ruptures cell membranes, and inactivates the nucleic acids that allow them to reproduce. In theory, this makes the milk \u201csafer\u201d by dramatically lowering the numbers of disease\u2011causing microbes.\n\n**Why raw milk still comes out ahead**\n\n1. **Preservation of Beneficial Microflora**  \n   Raw milk is a living ecosystem. It contains a balanced community of lactic\u2011acid bacteria, yeasts, and bacteriophages that compete with, and often out\u2011compete, pathogenic organisms. Those same microbes produce natural antimicrobials (such as bacteriocins) that inhibit disease\u2011causing bacteria *in situ*. Pasteurization wipes out this protective community, leaving the milk vulnerable to post\u2011process contamination.\n\n2. **Retention of Enzymes and Bioactive Proteins**  \n   Heat destroys important enzymes like lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, and lipase, all of which have antimicrobial and anti\u2011inflammatory properties. Raw milk retains these enzymes, which continue to break down potential pathogens and support the gut\u2019s immune defenses.\n\n3. **Nutrient Integrity**  \n   Vitamins (especially B\u2011complex and vitamin C), immunoglobulins, and growth factors are heat\u2011labile. Even the relatively gentle LTLT method can reduce vitamin B12 by up to 30\u202f% and inactivate immunoglobulins that help the body neutralize infections. Raw milk delivers these nutrients in their full, bioavailable form.\n\n4. **Lower Risk of Re\u2011contamination**  \n   Once milk is pasteurized, it must be handled in a sterile environment to keep it safe. In practice, most dairy facilities have multiple points where re\u2011contamination can occur\u2014during cooling, packaging, transport, or storage. Raw milk, when sourced directly from a healthy, well\u2011managed herd, bypasses those industrial handling steps entirely.\n\n5. **Evidence from Long\u2011Standing Traditions**  \n   For centuries, pastoral societies have relied on raw milk as a staple without the modern disease outbreaks that critics cite. The key has always been sound herd health, proper milking hygiene, and rapid consumption. When those conditions are met, the incidence of illness is vanishingly low.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nPasteurization does indeed kill many harmful bacteria by applying heat that denatures their cellular machinery. However, that same heat also eliminates the natural, beneficial microbes and heat\u2011sensitive nutrients that give raw milk its superior safety profile. When raw milk is produced under strict sanitary conditions\u2014healthy cows, clean milking equipment, rapid cooling, and prompt consumption\u2014the milk\u2019s native defenses make it at least as safe, and nutritionally richer, than its pasteurized counterpart.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How a Model Farmer Guarantees a Healthy Herd and Clean Raw Milk  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration of the best\u2011in\u2011class practices that a conscientious raw\u2011milk producer follows every day. When each of these measures is applied consistently, the milk that leaves the barn is a living, nutrient\u2011dense product that remains safe for the consumer.\n\n| **Stage** | **Action** | **Why It Matters** |\n|-----------|------------|--------------------|\n| **1. Herd Health Management** | \u2022 **Regular veterinary check\u2011ups** (quarterly physical exams, blood work, fecal screens). <br>\u2022 **Vaccination program** targeting common bovine pathogens (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Salmonella* spp., *Streptococcus* spp.). <br>\u2022 **Parasite control** with strategic de\u2011worming based on fecal egg counts. | A disease\u2011free herd produces milk that is already low in pathogenic load. Vaccines and parasite control keep the immune system strong, reducing the chance that harmful bacteria ever appear in the udder. |\n| **2. Nutrition & Housing** | \u2022 **Balanced, high\u2011quality forage** (grass\u2011silage rotation, pasture grazing) enriched with minerals (selenium, zinc). <br>\u2022 **Clean, dry bedding** and **well\u2011ventilated barns** to prevent mastitis\u2011causing bacteria from proliferating. | Good nutrition and a stress\u2011free environment lower somatic\u2011cell counts, a direct indicator that the udder is free of infection. |\n| **3. Milking Hygiene** | \u2022 **Pre\u2011milking udder sanitation**: warm water rinse \u2192 single\u2011use disposable udder wipes soaked in a food\u2011grade sanitizer (e.g., lactic acid solution). <br>\u2022 **Post\u2011milking teat dip** (organic chlorhexidine\u2011free formula) to seal the teat canal. <br>\u2022 **Sanitized milking equipment**: stainless\u2011steel bulk tank and pipeline cleaned after every milking session with a hot\u2011water, alkaline\u2011detergent wash followed by a certified food\u2011grade sanitizer rinse. | Removing surface contaminants and sealing the teat canal prevents entry of environmental pathogens during milking. Clean equipment eliminates cross\u2011contamination between cows. |\n| **4. Rapid Cooling & Storage** | \u2022 **Immediate cooling**: Milk is pumped straight into a refrigerated bulk tank set at **1\u20134\u202f\u00b0C (34\u201339\u202f\u00b0F)**. <br>\u2022 **Cold\u2011chain integrity**: From the tank to the farm\u2011store cooler, the product never exceeds 4\u202f\u00b0C. | Most spoilage and pathogenic bacteria multiply slowly at \u22644\u202f\u00b0C, so the bacterial load stays at background levels for days. |\n| **5. On\u2011Farm Testing** | \u2022 **Weekly microbial testing** of bulk milk for total plate count, coliforms, and *Staphylococcus aureus*. <br>\u2022 **Rapid PCR assays** for *E.\u202fcoli* O157 and *Listeria* spp. on a rotating basis. <br>\u2022 **Somatic\u2011cell count monitoring** (target <200,000 cells/mL). | Objective data give the farmer immediate feedback. If any parameter drifts upward, corrective actions (e.g., extra udder cleaning, targeted veterinary treatment) are taken before the milk reaches the consumer. |\n| **6. Transparent Distribution** | \u2022 **Batch labeling** with \u201cmilked on\u202f[date]\u201d and \u201ctested on\u202f[date]\u201d. <br>\u2022 **Direct\u2011to\u2011consumer sales** (farm stand, CSA boxes) within 24\u202fhours of milking whenever possible. | Consumers know exactly when the milk was produced and tested, reinforcing trust and ensuring the product is consumed while it\u2019s at its freshest. |\n\n---\n\n### Typical Shelf\u2011Life Comparison  \n\n| **Product** | **Cold\u2011Chain Temperature** | **Usual Shelf\u2011Life (Refrigerated)** | **Key Reason for",
