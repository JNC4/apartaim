      "truthbot_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away  \n- **Public\u2011health consensus:**  Pasteurisation dramatically reduces the risk of food\u2011borne illness.  Raw milk carries a **10\u2013100\u2011fold higher** risk of serious bacterial infection per serving, and the absolute number of outbreaks linked to raw milk far exceeds those linked to pasteurised milk.  \n- **Nutritional differences:**  Heat\u2011treatment destroys some heat\u2011sensitive vitamins, enzymes and non\u2011pathogenic bacteria, but the loss is modest (\u2248\u202f5\u201115\u202f% of certain B\u2011vitamins, negligible for protein, calcium, vitamin\u2011D, etc.).  No robust, reproducible clinical benefit has been demonstrated for the claimed \u201cextra\u201d nutrients.  \n- **Health\u2011claim evidence:**  Small observational studies suggest lower rates of asthma or allergy in children who regularly drink raw milk, but these findings are **confounded** (e.g., rural lifestyle, genetics, overall diet) and have not been confirmed in randomized trials.  \n- **Bottom line:**  If the priority is to **minimise the chance of a life\u2011threatening infection**, pasteurised milk is far safer.  If you value the (still\u2011unproven) possible immunological benefits of raw milk and are willing to accept the documented infection risk, you must rely on very strict on\u2011farm hygiene and frequent testing\u2014yet the risk never disappears completely.\n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based breakdown of the safety picture for raw versus pasteurised milk, with citations, consensus statements, and notes on where the science is still uncertain or contested.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

In this outbreak, the median age of patients was 68\u202fyears; the single fatality occurred in a 72\u2011year\u2011old patient with chronic heart disease, who developed meningitis and septicemia. |\n| **Key Take\u2011away for Consumers** | The outbreak illustrates how *Listeria* can survive and even proliferate in raw milk that is stored at refrigeration temperatures, especially when milking equipment is not adequately sanitized. Pasteurization (heating milk to at least 72\u202f\u00b0C/161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fseconds) reliably eliminates *Listeria* and other pathogenic bacteria, dramatically reducing the risk of such severe infections. |\n\n#### Why This Outbreak Is Notable\n1. **Genetic Fingerprinting** \u2013 Whole\u2011genome sequencing provided a definitive link between patient isolates and the farm\u2019s milk, leaving no doubt about the source.\n2. **Severity of Illness** \u2013 *Listeria* is one of the most dangerous food\u2011borne pathogens; it can cross the intestinal barrier, enter the bloodstream, and reach the central nervous system.\n3. **Regulatory Response** \u2013 The rapid, coordinated response across federal and state agencies showcases the public\u2011health infrastructure that monitors and controls milk\u2011borne disease.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\nThe 2022\u20112023 *Listeria* outbreak demonstrates that raw milk can harbor pathogens capable of causing life\u2011threatening illness. The same pathogen is reliably destroyed by the standard pasteurization process, underscoring the safety advantage of pasteurized milk.",

How the outbreak was detected  \n\n| Step | What the investigators did | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------------------|----------------|\n| **2.1. Clinical alert** | Two patients presented to different hospitals with *Campylobacter* gastroenteritis within 48\u202fh. Both isolates were submitted to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) lab. | The same pathogen in two unrelated patients raises a red flag for a common exposure. |\n| **2.2. Laboratory typing** | The DSHS performed **Pulsed\u2011Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)** and later **Whole\u2011Genome Sequencing (WGS)**. All isolates shared an indistinguishable PFGE pattern and \u2264\u202f2 single\u2011nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on WGS, indicating a single strain. | High\u2011resolution typing proves the cases are epidemiologically linked, not coincidental. |\n| **2.3. Epidemiologic interview** | A standardized \u201cfood\u2011frequency questionnaire\u201d was administered to each case (or proxy). >\u202f80\u202f% reported drinking raw milk from the same farm in the week before illness. | Systematic data collection pinpoints the exposure. |\n| **2.4. Environmental sampling** | Investigators visited the farm on 28\u202fMay\u202f2022, collected **bulk\u2011tank milk**, **udder swabs**, **milking\u2011equipment swabs**, and **water samples**. The bulk\u2011tank milk tested positive for *C. jejuni* with the same PFGE/WGS profile as the patient isolates. | Direct microbiological evidence links the product to the outbreak strain. |\n| **2.5. Trace\u2011back & recall** | The farm\u2019s distribution records showed that the contaminated bulk tank was sold to **seven** retail \u201cfarm\u2011stand\u201d locations and directly to **\u2248\u202f120** private customers (via home\u2011delivery). All sales were voluntarily halted on 30\u202fMay, and a **public health advisory** was issued. | Rapid product removal stops further exposures. |\n| **2.6. Public communication** | The Texas DSHS, CDC, and the farm\u2019s state\u2011agricultural agency issued press releases, posted alerts on the FDA\u2019s \u201cFood Safety Alerts\u201d page, and sent letters to all known customers. | Transparent communication helps the public seek care early and reduces panic. |\n| **2.7. Follow\u2011up testing** | One month later, the farm\u2019s bulk\u2011tank milk was re\u2011tested; *C. jejuni* was **not** detected. The farm implemented a **mandatory 24\u2011h post\u2011milking tank\u2011flush** and introduced a **daily on\u2011site bacterial test** (coliform count \u2264\u202f10\u202fCFU/mL)",
