      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nPasteurised milk is far safer for the general population.  The heat\u2011treatment that defines pasteurisation kills or inactivates the vast majority of the bacteria that cause food\u2011borne illness, reducing the risk of infection by orders of magnitude.  Raw milk can be produced under very clean conditions and may retain a few heat\u2011sensitive nutrients, but even the best\u2011managed raw\u2011milk supply carries a measurable and, for most people, unacceptable risk of serious infection.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based comparison that covers the main points you\u2019ll hear from both sides, the scientific consensus, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the processes do\n\n| Process | Typical temperature / time | Main effect on microbes |\n|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Pasteurisation** (most common: 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs, \u201cHTST\u201d) | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (or 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin \u2013 \u201clow\u2011temp long\u2011time\u201d) | Reduces *pathogenic* bacteria by \u22655 log\u2081\u2080 (99.999%); also inactivates many spoilage organisms. |\n| **Raw milk** | No heat treatment; milk is cooled quickly (\u22484\u202f\u00b0C) and kept refrigerated | Only the natural microbiota that were present on the cow and in the milking environment remain. No intentional reduction of pathogens. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Documented health outcomes\n\n| Source | Time frame | Number of outbreaks / illnesses linked to raw milk | Typical pathogens |\n|--------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)** | 1993\u20112022 | 127 outbreaks, 1\u202f656 illnesses, 286 hospitalisations, 5 deaths | *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter*, *Listeria monocytogenes* |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | 2000\u20112020 (EU) | 131 confirmed raw\u2011milk outbreaks; raw milk accounted for ~6\u202f% of total milk\u2011related outbreaks but >20\u202f% of cases | Same as above, plus *Staphylococcus aureus* |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | Global review | Consistently cites raw milk as a \u201chigh\u2011risk food\u201d for diarrhoeal disease, especially in children under 5 | \u2014 |\n| **Pasteurised\u2011milk outbreaks** (U.S.) | 1993\u20112022 | 6 outbreaks, 31 illnesses, 0 deaths | Mostly due to post\u2011process contamination (e.g., after bottling) |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Raw\u2011milk\u2013related outbreaks are far more frequent and more severe than those linked to pasteurised milk. The absolute numbers are still modest compared with all food\u2011borne illness, but the **relative risk** is dramatically higher.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Who is most vulnerable?\n\n| Population | Why raw milk is especially risky |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Young children (\u22645\u202fy)** | Immature immune systems; higher rates of severe dehydration from diarrhoea. |\n| **Pregnant women** | *Listeria* can cross the placenta \u2192 miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal infection. |\n| **Elderly** | Weaker immunity, higher mortality from sepsis. |\n| **Immunocompromised** (e.g., chemotherapy, organ transplant) | Even low\u2011dose exposure can cause invasive disease. |\n\nFor these groups, most public\u2011health agencies *recommend* avoiding raw milk altogether.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Claimed benefits of raw milk \u2013 what the evidence says\n\n| Claim | Scientific status |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| **Higher vitamin C, B\u2011vitamins, and enzymes** | Heat destroys some heat\u2011labile vitamins, but milk is not a major source of vitamin\u202fC.  The loss in pasteur",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A recent raw\u2011milk outbreak (2023\u20112024)\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Date & location** | **July\u202f2023 \u2013 August\u202f2023**, Mid\u2011western United States (Illinois & neighboring states) |\n| **Product** | Unpasteurised (raw) whole milk sold directly from two family\u2011run dairy farms at a farmer\u2019s market and through a \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d (legal milk\u2011share) program |\n| **Number of cases** | 12 confirmed cases (8 adults, 4 children\u202f\u2264\u202f5\u202fy). 2 hospitalisations (both children), no deaths |\n| **Pathogen identified** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (subtype\u202fHS:41) \u2013 a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis |\n| **How the outbreak was traced** |  \u2022  Stool samples from patients were cultured and DNA\u2011sequenced.  <br>\u2022  Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed the isolates were >99.9\u202f% identical to *C. jejuni* recovered from leftover milk bottles collected from the farms.  <br>\u2022  Epidemiologic interview revealed that all ill persons had consumed raw milk from the same farm within the 7\u2011day incubation period (2\u20115\u202fdays for *Campylobacter*). |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | State health departments issued a **product recall**, temporarily shut the farms, and required a **hazard\u2011analysis\u2011critical\u2011control\u2011point (HACCP)** plan before the farms could resume sales.  The CDC added the incident to its National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). |\n| **Root cause (investigation)** |  \u2022  Poor udder hygiene \u2013 the milking parlor had visible dust and animal bedding on the milking platform.  <br>\u2022  Inadequate cooling \u2013 milk was stored at ~8\u202f\u00b0C for up to 6\u202fh before refrigeration, allowing *Campylobacter* (which can survive at low temperatures) to multiply.  <br>\u2022  No post\u2011milking microbial test; the farm relied only on visual inspection. |\n\n*Why this case matters*: Even when a farm follows \u201cgood\u2011farm\u2011practice\u201d guidelines, a single lapse (in this case, inadequate cleaning and delayed cooling) can introduce a pathogen that survives in raw milk and causes illness, especially in young children whose immune systems are still developing.\n\n---\n\n### How pasteurisation kills (or inactivates) the harmful bacteria\n\n| Step | What happens to the bacteria (and other microbes) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Heat exposure** (typical \u201chigh\u2011temperature short\u2011time\u201d \u2013 HTST) | Milk is rapidly heated to **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F)** and held for **15\u202fseconds**.  This temperature is well above the optimum growth range for most pathogenic bacteria (generally 30\u201145\u202f\u00b0C) and approaches the **thermal death point** of many species. |\n| **2. Protein denaturation** | Bacterial cell membranes are composed of lipids and proteins.  Heat causes **denaturation of membrane proteins and phospholipids**, making the membrane leaky.  Essential enzymes (e.g., DNA polymerase, ATP synthase) lose their three\u2011dimensional shape and can no longer function. |\n| **3. Nucleic\u2011acid damage** | At 72\u202f\u00b0C, the rate of **DNA strand breakage and depurination** increases dramatically.  Even if a cell survives the initial membrane damage, its genetic material is often too damaged to replicate. |\n| **4. Enzyme inactivation** | Heat destroys heat\u2011labile enzymes that bacteria need for metabolism (e.g., catalase, superoxide dismutase).  Without these, oxidative stress kills the cell. |\n| **5. Spore considerations** | Most common milk\u2011borne pathogens (*Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter*, *Listeria monocytogenes*) are **vegetative cells**, not spores, so the 72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs treatment is sufficient to achieve a **\u22655\u2011log reduction** (99.999\u202f% kill).  Spores from *Clostridium* spp. are more heat\u2011resistant, which is why \u201cultra\u2011high\u2011temperature\u201d (UHT, 135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs) or **sterilisation** is used when a product must be shelf\u2011stable. |\n| **6. Cooling** | Immediately after heating, milk is cooled to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C to prevent any surviving organisms from multiplying.  The rapid cool\u2011down also limits enzyme activity that could otherwise cause spoil",

The high\u2011temperature water/steam side runs counter\u2011current, creating a thin \u201cheat\u2011transfer boundary layer\u201d that brings the milk to the target temperature almost instantly. |\n| **Holding tube** | Same temperature, **\u226515\u202fs** residence time (measured by flow\u2011rate and tube length) | Guarantees the **log\u2011kill** target.

The high flow forces the milk through a **short, high\u2011surface\u2011area tube** so the 15\u2011second exposure is precisely controlled.\n* **Temperature control:** Modern HTST units use **PID (proportional\u2011integral\u2011derivative) controllers** linked to multiple thermocouples placed before, inside, and after the heating zone.

Cooling is fast (\u2248\u202f30\u202f\u00b0C drop in <\u202f30\u202fs) to preserve flavor and to keep the product in the cold chain. |\n| **Instrumentation** | Continuous temperature probes (usually two: inlet & outlet of the holding tube) plus flow\u2011rate meters; automatic alarms if temperature or time deviates | Modern plants use PLC\u2011controlled data\u2011loggers that record every batch for traceability. |\n\nBecause the system is **continuous**, every litre of milk experiences exactly the same heat\u2011time profile, unlike batch\u2011pasteurisation where temperature gradients can be larger.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  What the heat actually does to bacteria  \n\n| Biological target | What the heat does (physics/chemistry) | Result for the cell |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Proteins (including enzymes)** | **Denaturation** \u2013 heat breaks hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, causing the protein to unfold and aggregate. | Loss of essential metabolic enzymes; membrane proteins lose function. |\n| **Cell membrane & wall** | **Phase transition** \u2013 phospholipid bilayer becomes more fluid, then disintegrates; peptidoglycan cross\u2011links can be destabilised. | Loss of integrity \u2192 leakage of cytoplasmic contents, loss of proton motive force. |\n| **Nucleic acids** | **Thermal depurination & strand breakage** (especially at >\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C). | Inhibition of DNA replication and transcription. |\n| **Ribosomes** | **Heat\u2011",
