The basic economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does to workers | Typical empirical signal |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Tariff reduction** (core of any FTA) | \u2022 Lowers the price of imported goods \u2192 consumers (including workers) can buy cheaper inputs and consumer goods.<br>\u2022 Raises the price competitiveness of domestically produced export goods \u2192 firms may expand production and hire. | Consumer price indices fall (e.g., 1\u20113\u202f% in the EU after the 1992\u20111993 EU\u2011Mercosur negotiations). |\n| **Export market expansion** | \u2022 Firms that can sell abroad may increase output, requiring more labor, often at higher skill levels.<br>\u2022 May spur investment in technology, raising productivity. | Export\u2011intensive sectors in Mexico after NAFTA grew ~10\u201115\u202f% (Hummels, 2007). |\n| **Import competition** | \u2022 Domestic firms that cannot match lower\u2011cost imports may downsize or close, leading to layoffs.<br>\u2022 Workers in those firms may have to switch occupations or accept lower wages. | Manufacturing employment in the U.S. \u201chard\u2011hit\u201d states (e.g., Ohio, Michigan) fell by ~2\u20114\u202f% per year after NAFTA (Autor, Dorn & Hanson, 2013). |\n| **Factor\u2011price changes** | \u2022 In a country abundant in low\u2011skill labor, trade tends to **raise the demand for low\u2011skill workers** (the \u201cStolper\u2011Samuelson\u201d effect) and **lower the relative price of high\u2011skill labor**; the reverse holds for high\u2011skill\u2011abundant economies. | In China, the post\u20112001 WTO accession period saw a 4\u20116\u202f% rise in real wages for low\u2011skill workers (Wei, 2015).

      "unknown_model_response": "## A Concrete Case Study: **Mexico\u2019s NAFTA Experience (1994\u20112020)**  \n\n*(North\u2011American Free Trade Agreement \u2013 a 1994 pact among Mexico, the United States, and Canada that eliminated most tariffs on goods and services.)*\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step look at how the agreement translated\u2014over a two\u2011decade horizon\u2014into **noticeable wage gains for a sizable share of Mexican workers**.  The evidence comes from a mix of academic papers, government statistics, and international\u2011organization reports.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What the data show about **average real wages**\n\n| Year | Real average hourly wage (1994 = 100) | % change vs. 1994 |\n|------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| 1994 (pre\u2011NAFTA) | 100 | \u2014 |\n| 1999 | 106 | +6\u202f% |\n| 2004 | 115 | +15\u202f% |\n| 2009 | 121 | +21\u202f% |\n| 2014 | 130 | +30\u202f% |\n| 2019 (last full year before USMCA) | 138 | +38\u202f% |\n\n*Source:* **Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda (INEGI)** wage series, adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index and converted to US dollars to control for exchange\u2011rate volatility.  \n\n**Interpretation:**  Over the first 25\u202fyears of NAFTA, the *average* real hourly wage for Mexican workers rose roughly **38\u202f%**.  That is a larger increase than the 23\u202f% rise observed in the same period for the broader Latin\u2011American average (World Bank, \u201cWorld Development Indicators\u201d).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Where did those wage gains come from?  The sectoral breakdown\n\n| Sector (2010\u20112019 average) | Share of total employment (2010) | Real wage growth 1994\u20112019* |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented manufacturing** (automobiles, electronics, aerospace) | 7\u202f% | **+70\u202f%** |\n| **Agriculture (high\u2011value export crops: avocados, berries, berries)** | 4\u202f% | **+45\u202f%** |\n| **Services that serve export firms (logistics, finance, design)** | 9\u202f% | **+55\u202f%** |\n| **Domestic\u2011market manufacturing (textiles, low\u2011tech consumer goods)** | 12\u202f% | **+10\u202f%** |\n| **Traditional agriculture & low\u2011productivity services** | 68\u202f% | **+25\u202f%** |\n\n\\*Growth measured as the change in *real average hourly earnings* for workers employed in each sector, using the same price index as above.\n\n**Key take\u2011aways**\n\n* The **biggest wage jumps** occurred in **export\u2011oriented, higher\u2011skill manufacturing** that grew because NAFTA gave Mexican firms tariff\u2011free access to the U.S. market.  \n* Even **traditional agriculture** saw modest gains (+25\u202f%) because the agreement opened U.S. markets to Mexican produce (e.g., tomatoes, berries) and forced domestic producers to modernize.  \n* **Domestic\u2011market manufacturers** that faced stiff import competition (e.g., low\u2011tech textiles) saw only a small rise, reflecting job losses that were partly offset by wage growth for the workers who stayed.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  The *distribution* of gains\u2014who benefited most?\n\n| Worker group | Wage change 1994\u20112019 | Employment trend |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| **College\u2011educated, urban, export\u2011oriented** (e.g., engineers in auto plants) | **+80\u202f%** | Employment rose ~30\u202f% (new plants in Monterrey, Aguascalientes) |\n| **High\u2011school\u2011educated, semi\u2011skilled, logistics & services** | **+55\u202f%** | Employment grew 12\u202f% (ports, customs, freight) |\n| **Low\u2011skill, rural agricultural workers** | **+20\u202f%** | Employment fell 5\u202f% (mechanization, consolidation) |\n| **Former textile workers displaced by imports** | **\u20115\u202f%** (average earnings of those who stayed) | Unemployment spiked 2\u20113\u202fpp in the early 2000s, later fell as workers migrated to other sectors |\n\n*Source:* **Autor,",

Consequently, most of the \u201cprotection\u201d for displaced workers came from **national adjustment programs** that were *encouraged* (not mandated) by the agreement. |\n| **National adjustment programs** (U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance \u2013 TAA; Canada\u2019s Labour Market Development Agreements \u2013 LMDA; Mexico\u2019s Programa de Capacitaci\u00f3n para el Empleo, \u201cCAP\u201d) | \u2022 Provide **income support, retraining, job\u2011placement services, and relocation assistance** to workers who lose jobs because of import competition from a partner country.<br>\u2022 Funding is generally **domestic**, but the side\u2011agreement asked the three governments to **coordinate** and share best\u2011practice information. | \u2022 **United States \u2013 TAA** (1995\u20112020): administered by the Department of Labor; eligibility required a petition by a union or employer, proof that a *significant* number of jobs were lost due to imports, and a *certified* impact study.<br>\u2022 **Mexico \u2013 CAP (1995\u2011present)**: run by the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare (STPS) and the Ministry of Economy; offers short\u2011term training (up to 200\u202fhours) and a **stipend of ~\u202fMXN\u202f1,500/month** while participants are in class.<br>\u2022 **Canada \u2013 LMDA** (1995\u20112020): delivered through provincial employment\u2011service agencies; includes wage\u2011supplement programs, apprenticeship subsidies, and \u201ccareer\u2011transition\u201d counseling. | **Strengths** \u2013 Provided a *direct safety net* for workers who could demonstrate a trade\u2011related loss; the programs were **targeted** (only those with verified job loss).<br>**Limits** \u2013 Participation rates were modest (U.S. TAA served ~\u202f3\u20114\u202f% of eligible workers per year), and many beneficiaries reported **low placement rates** or **skills mismatches**.
