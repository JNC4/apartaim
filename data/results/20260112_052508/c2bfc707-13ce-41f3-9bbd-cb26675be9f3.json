      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.\u202fWhy most public\u2011health experts **recommend vaccinating children**\n\n| Reason | What it means in practice | Key evidence |\n|--------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| **Direct protection of the child** | A vaccine trains the child\u2019s immune system to recognise a pathogen without the child having to suffer the disease. | \u2022\u202fClinical\u2011trial efficacy rates: 94\u201199\u202f% for measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR), 93\u202f% for varicella, >\u202f90\u202f% for the 4\u2011dose DTaP series. <br>\u2022\u202fPost\u2011licensure studies show >\u202f99\u202f% reduction in cases of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus in vaccinated cohorts. |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | When enough people are immune, the pathogen has few \u201chosts\u201d to jump to, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants, immunocompromised). | \u2022\u202fMathematical models and real\u2011world data show that measles transmission drops sharply once coverage >\u202f95\u202f% is achieved; outbreaks re\u2011appear when coverage falls below that threshold (e.g., 2019\u20112020 US measles resurgence). |\n| **Prevention of severe complications** | Many vaccine\u2011preventable diseases can cause permanent injury or death (e.g., encephalitis from measles, permanent lung damage from pertussis, paralysis from polio). | \u2022\u202fCDC estimates: 1 in 5 children who get measles develop serious complications; 1 in 10 who survive meningitis (a complication of Hib) is left with permanent disability. |\n| **Economic and societal benefits** | Fewer hospitalisations, less time off school/work for families, lower health\u2011care costs, and reduced strain on health systems. | \u2022\u202fAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) estimates: each dollar spent on childhood vaccination saves $3\u2013$10 in direct medical costs and $10\u2013$30 in societal costs. |\n| **Eradication or near\u2011eradication of diseases** | Successful campaigns can eliminate a disease globally (smallpox) or in a region (polio in the Americas, measles in many high\u2011income countries). | \u2022\u202fSmallpox eradicated 1980; polio cases fell >\u202f99\u202f% since 1988 (from 350\u202f000 to <\u202f1\u202f000 annual cases). |\n| **Preparedness for future outbreaks** | High coverage maintains a \u201cbuffer\u201d that limits the spread of emerging or re\u2011emerging pathogens (e.g., COVID\u201119 showed how quickly immunity can wane in under\u2011vaccinated pockets). | \u2022\u202fModeling of COVID\u201119 demonstrated that communities with >\u202f80\u202f% adult vaccination had far fewer hospitalisations during the Delta wave. |\n\n### Bottom\u2011line for this point\nThe **scientific consensus**\u2014endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and virtually every major medical association\u2014is that the **benefits of routine childhood vaccination far outweigh the risks** for the overwhelming majority of children.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHow safe are the vaccines that are given to children?\n\n### 2.1\u202fThe safety\u2011assessment pipeline\n\n| Stage | What happens | Who oversees it |\n|-------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Pre\u2011clinical** | Laboratory work & animal studies to spot obvious toxicity. | National regulatory bodies (e.g., FDA, EMA). |\n| **Phase\u202fI\u2011III clinical trials** | 10\u202f000\u201180\u202f000 participants across multiple countries; randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled (or active\u2011control) designs. | Independent Data Safety Monitoring Boards + regulators. |\n| **Regulatory licensure** | Review of efficacy, safety, manufacturing quality, and risk\u2011management plans. | FDA, EMA, Health Canada, etc. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure surveillance** | \u2022\u202fPassive systems (VAERS in the U.S., Yellow Card in the U.K.). <br>\u2022\u202fActive systems (CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, the U.K.\u2019s Clinical Practice Research Datalink, WHO",

Bednarczyk\u202fet\u202fal., *Vaccine*\u202f2020) identified concerns about \u201cvaccine safety\u201d, \u201creligious autonomy\u201d, and \u201cmisinformation on social media\u201d as drivers of refusal in those neighborhoods. |\n| **High transmissibility of measles** | The basic reproduction number (R\u2080) for measles is 12\u201118.  To keep the effective reproduction number (R\u2091)\u202f<\u202f1, **\u2265\u202f95\u202f% two\u2011dose coverage is needed**.  Falling even a few points below that threshold creates a \u201csusceptible pocket\u201d that can sustain transmission. |\n| **International importations** | The index case in New York was a traveler who contracted measles in Israel (where a large outbreak was occurring in 2018\u201119).  Because the local community\u2019s immunity was below the herd\u2011immunity threshold, the virus spread rapidly. |\n| **Delayed catch\u2011up vaccination** | Some families had previously delayed the first MMR dose (normally given at 12\u201115\u202fmonths).  When the outbreak began, many children were still **unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated**, providing the virus with a larger pool of hosts. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.\u202fWhat was the public\u2011health response?\n\n| Action | Timeline | Outcome |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| **Urgent \u201cring\u2011vaccination\u201d campaigns** (mobile clinics, school\u2011based drives) | Initiated within weeks of case clusters being identified. | In the NYC outbreak, two\u2011dose coverage rose from 78\u202f% to **\u2248\u202f93\u202f%** within 3\u202fmonths. |\n| **Public\u2011information blitz** (press conferences, targeted messaging in community languages, engagement of religious leaders) | Ongoing throughout 2019. | Surveyed parents in the affected neighborhoods reported a **15\u2011point increase** in confidence that the MMR vaccine is safe. |\n| **Legal/administrative measures** (temporary suspension of school exemptions, mandatory documentation of vaccination status) | New York State passed a law in April\u202f2019 limiting non\u2011medical exemptions. | By the end of 2020, the **overall exemption rate fell from 2.3\u202f% to 0.6\u202f%** in New York State. |\n| **Enhanced surveillance** (real\u2011time reporting, genome sequencing to link cases) | Implement",
