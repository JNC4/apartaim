What \u201cdeterrence\u201d means in this debate  \n\n| Term | What it refers to | Typical way it is measured |\n|------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| **General deterrence** | The idea that the existence of the death penalty reduces the overall incidence of homicide in a society. | Cross\u2011state or cross\u2011country comparisons of homicide rates before/after abolition or introduction of capital punishment; econometric regressions controlling for other variables. |\n| **Specific deterrence** | The idea that a particular offender refrains from further killing because they know they will be executed if caught. | Recidivism rates of convicted murderers sentenced to death vs. life; surveys of offenders\u2019 stated motivations; case\u2011studies of serial killers. |\n| **Certainty vs. severity** | Criminal\u2011justice theory (e.g., rational\u2011choice, expected\u2011utility) predicts that **certainty of punishment** matters far more than **severity**. | Empirical work on detection rates, conviction rates, and the \u201cspeed\u201d of punishment. |\n\nUnderstanding this distinction is crucial because most of the empirical work can only speak to **general deterrence** (population\u2011level homicide trends).

(1975).** *The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life and Death.* **American Economic Review, 65(3), 397\u2011417.**  \n\nEhrlich\u2019s article is the one most often quoted when a pro\u2011death\u2011penalty argument points to \u201cresearch showing that each execution saves lives\u201d. It was also the first quantitative, econometric analysis of the issue and therefore set the agenda for a half\u2011century of debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Ehrlich did (the original claim)\n\n| Step | What the paper did | Result that was highlighted |\n|------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Data** | State\u2011level homicide counts (1960\u20111970) for 17 U.S. states that carried out executions. |  |\n| **Model** | Simple linear regression: **Homicides = \u03b1 + \u03b2\u00b7Executions + \u03b3\u00b7Controls + \u03b5**. Controls included per\u2011capita income, unemployment, police officers per capita, and a dummy for \u201cFurman v. Georgia\u201d (1972) because that decision temporarily halted executions. |  |\n| **Key coefficient (\u03b2)** | **\u03b2 \u2248 \u20130.7** (negative and statistically significant at the 5\u202f% level). Interpreted as \u201ceach execution prevented roughly 0.7 murders per year\u201d. | This single number became the headline \u201cthe death penalty saves lives\u201d. |\n\nThe paper was published in a top economics journal, received a lot of media coverage, and was cited by policymakers and advocacy groups on both sides of the death\u2011penalty debate.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why later scholars began to doubt the finding\n\n| Critique | Explanation | How it undermines the original result |\n|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Omitted\u2011variable bias** | The model omitted several factors that affect homicide rates and also influence the likelihood of executions, such as: <br>\u2022 *Gun ownership rates* (which rose dramatically in the 1960s). <br>\u2022 *Changes in policing tactics* (e.g., the \u201claw\u2011and\u2011order\u201d wave of the late\u201160s). <br>\u2022 *Drug\u2011related violence* (emerging in the early 70s). | If any of these omitted variables were positively correlated with both executions and homicides, the negative \u03b2 would be biased downward (i.e., it would look more deterrent than it really is). |\n| **Reverse causality (simultaneity)** | Homicide spikes often prompted political pressure to resume executions. The regression treated \u201cexecutions\u201d as an exogenous predictor of homicide, but in reality the causal arrow can run the other way. | This can generate a spurious negative relationship because a rise in murders leads to more executions *after* the spike, not before. |\n| **Small sample & limited time span** | Only 17 states over a 10\u2011year window (\u2248170 state\u2011year observations). The statistical power is low, and a few outlier years (e.g., 1968\u201169, when several states dramatically increased both homicide and execution rates) drive the result. | The estimate is highly sensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of a handful of observations. |\n| **Measurement error in \u201cexecutions\u201d** | Ehrlich counted *executions* rather than *sentences* or *death\u2011penalty statutes*. The number of executions is a noisy proxy for the *threat* of death, which is what a deterrent would require. | A weak proxy attenuates the estimated effect, but combined with omitted variables it can also produce sign reversal in different specifications. |\n| **Failure to control for \u201cFurman\u201d and \u201cPost\u2011Furman\u201d regime changes** | The 1972 Supreme Court decision temporarily halted executions, creating a structural break. Ehrlich\u2019s dummy variable does not fully capture the complex policy environment (e.g., states that reinstated the death penalty in 1976 and 1977). | The dummy may soak up some variation that actually belongs to the execution variable, distorting the coefficient. |\n| **Later replication attempts** | - **Bailey & Epp (1995)** re\u2011estimated the model with a longer data series (1960\u20111992) and found \u03b2 not statistically different from zero.  <br>- **Donohue & Wolfers (2005)** showed that small changes in the specification (e.g., adding a \u201cpercent of population aged 15\u201124\u201d) flip the sign of \u03b2.  <",
      "truthbot_response": "Below is a **single, well\u2011known study that concluded the death penalty does deter homicide** and a step\u2011by\u2011step explanation of **why later researchers have found serious problems with its design, data, and interpretation**.  \nThe example is the **2003 article by Dezhbakhsh, Shepherd, and Walsh** (often shortened to **DSW\u20112003**) because it is the most\u2011cited \u201cpro\u2011deterrence\u201d paper in the modern literature and because it sparked a large, documented cascade of re\u2011analyses and methodological critiques.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

New Evidence from Post\u2011Appeal Death Sentences.\u201d* **Journal of Legal Studies**, 32(1), 1\u201155. |\n| **Data set** | All **post\u2011appeal** death\u2011sentence cases in the United States from **1977\u20111997** (\u2248\u202f1,000 cases). The authors compared the homicide rate in a state **in the year a death sentence was handed down** with the homicide rate in the same state **the following year**. |\n| **Statistical model** | Fixed\u2011effects linear regression (state\u2011year panel). The key independent variable is a dummy that equals 1 for the year a death sentence is *issued* (not executed) and 0 otherwise. Controls include: unemployment, poverty, police per capita, incarceration rate, and a set of year\u2011specific dummies. |\n| **Main quantitative finding** | A death\u2011sentence year is associated with **0.8 fewer murders per 100,000 population** (\u2248\u202f21 fewer murders per state per year). Translating this into a \u201clives saved\u201d figure, the authors estimated **\u2248\u202f18 lives saved per execution**. |\n| **Policy\u2011relevant conclusion** | Because each death sentence appears to cut homicide rates, the authors argued that **capital punishment is an effective general deterrent** and that \u201cthe life\u2011saving benefits of the death penalty outweigh its costs.\u201d |\n\nThe study quickly became the **canonical citation** for legislators, advocacy groups, and media outlets that wanted a \u201cscientific\u201d justification for keeping or expanding the death penalty.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Why researchers later questioned (and largely rejected) those findings  \n\n### 2.1  Core conceptual problem: **Confusing *sentence* with *execution***  \n\n| Issue | Explanation |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Deterrence theory** predicts that potential offenders respond to the *perceived* likelihood of being *killed*, not to the *administrative act* of a judge issuing a sentence. | A death **sentence** is usually **secret** (the defendant is not publicly identified) and **rarely known** to the general public. Most people who might be deterred would only hear about **executions**, not about the moment a court pronounces a death sentence. |\n| **Empirical implication** | If the deterrent mechanism is \u201cpeople fear being executed,\u201d the appropriate variable to test is **the number of executions**, not the number of sentences. Using sentences inflates the \u201cdose\u201d of the penalty by a factor of roughly **10\u201315** (most sentenced inmates die after many years of appeals). |\n| **Later re\u2011analyses** | Subsequent papers (e.g., **Radelet & Lacock 2009**, **Cook 2009**, **Nagin & Pepper 2012**) re\u2011estimated the model using **executions** instead of sentences and found the effect disappears (coefficients not statistically different from zero). |\n\n### 2.2  **Statistical\u2011design flaws** \u2013 omitted\u2011variable bias & reverse causality  \n\n| Problem | How it manifested in DSW\u20112003 |\n|---------|------------------------------|\n| **Omitted variables** | The regression omitted **key crime\u2011deterrence drivers** such as: (i) **gun\u2011availability indexes**, (ii) **drug\u2011market activity**, (iii) **changes in policing strategies**, (iv) **media coverage of high\u2011profile murders**. If any of these variables changed in the same year a death sentence was handed down, the estimated coefficient would pick up their effect instead of a true deterrent effect. |\n| **Reverse causality**",

The post\u2011treatment homicide trajectory of the real state is then compared with its synthetic counterpart. | SCM is a quasi\u2011experimental technique that mimics a randomized experiment by creating a counterfactual that would have occurred **absent the execution**.
