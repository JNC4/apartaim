      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **In the short run** rent\u2011control (RC) policies usually keep the rents of existing tenants lower than market rates and can improve affordability for those households.\n- **In the long run (5\u202f+\u202fyears)** most empirical studies find that the *overall* affordability of a city\u2019s rental housing stock tends to decline because the policies reduce the incentive to build new units, to maintain existing ones, or to convert apartments to rental use.  The net effect is usually a smaller, poorer\u2011quality stock that benefits a relatively small group of \u201cprotected\u201d tenants while making it harder for newcomers to find affordable housing.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of why scholars and policymakers see the issue the way they do, where the evidence is strongest, and where the debate remains open.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How rent control works (the basic mechanisms)\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical long\u2011run consequence (if left unchecked) |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling on existing leases** | Caps the rent that a landlord can charge a tenant who is already in place. | Rent\u2011controlled units become \u201cscarce\u201d because they are cheaper than market\u2011rate units. |\n| **Vacancy decontrol / \u201cstrict\u201d caps** | When a tenant moves out, the unit can be reset to market rent (or a modest increase). | Creates a \u201cdual market\u201d: low\u2011rent \u201cprotected\u201d units vs. high\u2011rent \u201cnew\u201d units. The protected pool shrinks over time as turnover occurs. |\n| **Indexation (e.g., CPI\u2011linked)** | Allows limited annual rent increases. | Mitigates the erosion of real rents but still keeps them below pure market rates. |\n| **Regulatory \u201ccoverage\u201d** | The share of the rental stock subject to the rule (e.g., all units under $2\u202fM, or only units built before a certain date). | Higher coverage \u2192 larger distortion of supply incentives. |\n| **Enforcement & compliance costs** | Landlords may spend resources on legal battles, \u201ckey\u2011money\u201d payments, or informal side\u2011payments. | Can increase transaction costs and reduce the net supply of rental units. |\n\n*Take\u2011away:* The *direct* effect of RC is lower rents for a subset of tenants. The *indirect* effects arise from how landlords respond to the altered profit expectations.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The empirical record \u2013 what the data actually show\n\n### 2.1.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **The bulk of empirical research (especially from the United States, Europe, and some Latin\u2011American cases) finds that **rent\u2011control policies tend to **reduce the quantity and quality of rental housing in the long run**, which in turn **weakens overall housing affordability** for the broader market.  \n- **A smaller, but growing, body of work shows that **well\u2011designed \u201ctargeted\u201d or \u201climited\u2011duration\u201d rent\u2011stabilization systems can **protect a modest share of low\u2011income renters without causing large supply\u2011side losses**, especially when paired with strong supply\u2011side incentives (e.g., new\u2011construction exemptions, vacancy\u2011bonus allowances, or \u201cinclusionary\u201d subsidies).  \n- **There is **no single, universally accepted conclusion** because outcomes depend heavily on **policy design, local market conditions, and the presence (or absence) of complementary housing\u2011production measures**.  \n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, evidence\u2011based overview** that lays out what is well\u2011established, what remains debated, and what is still unknown.
