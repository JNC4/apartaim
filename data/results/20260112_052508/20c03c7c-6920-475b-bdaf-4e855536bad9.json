Microbial Safety  \n\n### 1.1 What pasteurization does  \n\n* **Log\u2011reduction** \u2013 The FDA\u2011mandated HTST process (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) achieves at least a 5\u2011log (100,000\u2011fold) reduction of *C.\u202fperfringens* spores and a >5\u2011log reduction of *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, and *Campylobacter* (U.S. FDA Food Code, 2022).  \n* **Inactivation of enzymes** \u2013 Alkaline phosphatase is routinely measured as a \u201cprocess indicator\u201d because it is destroyed by proper pasteurization; its presence signals a processing failure.  \n\n### 1.2 Pathogen prevalence in raw milk  \n\n| Pathogen | Typical prevalence in raw milk studies (U.S./EU) | Typical illness severity |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| *Salmonella* spp. | 0.5\u20112\u202f% of samples (CDC, 2021) | Gastroenteritis, bacteremia |\n| *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 | 0.1\u20111\u202f% (EFSA, 2020) | Bloody diarrhea, HUS |\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | 0.2\u20111\u202f% (USDA, 2022) | Invasive disease, fetal loss |\n| *Campylobacter* spp. | 1\u20113\u202f% (CDC, 2020) | Diarrhea, Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome |\n| *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin\u2011producing) | 5\u2011",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n*Pasteurization dramatically reduces the risk of food\u2011borne illness from milk.  Large\u2011scale epidemiologic data show that raw (un\u2011pasteurized) milk is 150\u202f\u2013\u202f250\u202ftimes more likely to cause a confirmed outbreak of bacterial infection than pasteurized milk, and the absolute risk of a severe illness from a single serving of raw milk is estimated at roughly 1\u202fin\u202f10\u202f000 to 1\u202fin\u202f50\u202f000 (depending on the study and the population).  By contrast, the risk from pasteurized milk is <\u202f1\u202fin\u202f1\u202fmillion and is usually limited to rare post\u2011process contamination events.*\n\n*The nutritional composition of raw and pasteurized milk is essentially the same for most macro\u2011 and micronutrients; the few documented differences (slightly higher levels of some heat\u2011sensitive vitamins, enzymes, and beneficial bacteria) are small and have not been shown to produce measurable health benefits in controlled trials.*\n\n*Therefore, the scientific consensus is that the safety advantage of pasteurization far outweighs any modest, unproven nutritional advantage of raw milk.  The remaining uncertainties concern whether any specific sub\u2011populations (e.g., people with certain gut\u2011microbiome conditions) might derive a benefit from the live microbes in raw milk, but no high\u2011quality evidence currently supports a net health benefit that outweighs the infection risk.*\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, evidence\u2011based overview** that lays out:\n\n1. **What the data say about the frequency and severity of illness** from each type of milk.  \n2. **How the processing steps differ** and what they do to pathogens, nutrients, and other milk components.  \n3. **Where scientific consensus lies** and where debate or gaps remain.  \n4. **Common misconceptions** on both sides of the raw\u2011vs\u2011pasteurized debate.  \n5. **Key studies, reviews, and regulatory statements** that form the backbone of the evidence base.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The outbreak was reported to the CDC\u2019s Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS). |\n\n**Key source:**  \n- DSHS, \u201cInvestigation of an *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 outbreak associated with raw milk, Texas, 2012,\u201d *Texas Journal of Public Health* 2013;\u202f84(3): 22\u201131.  \n- CDC, \u201cMultistate outbreak of *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 infections linked to raw milk\u2014United States, 2012,\u201d *MMWR* 2013;62(3): 49\u201153.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.

Most **vegetative** bacteria (including the beneficial lactic\u2011acid bacteria) are killed. | \u2022 **Spore\u2011forming bacteria** (e.g., *Bacillus cereus*, *Clostridium* spp.) can survive because spores resist 72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs. Their numbers are usually low in a properly handled herd, but they can germinate later if the milk is stored too long. | The \u201cprobiotic\u201d effect that people attribute to raw milk\u2019s native bacteria is essentially **lost** after pasteurisation. Commercial probiotic dairy products (yogurt, kefir, some cheeses) re\u2011introduce selected strains **after** pasteurisation, so you can still get a probiotic benefit\u2014but it is *added* rather than *inherited* from the raw milk. |\n| **Added probiotic cultures** (e.g., for yogurt, kefir, fermented milks) | Not present in raw milk unless the farmer inoculates it on\u2011farm. | If a manufacturer wants a probiotic product, the cultures are added **after** the milk has been pasteurised (or after ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) treatment). The heat step is deliberately placed **before** inoculation to guarantee that only the intended strains survive. | All added probiotic strains survive because they are introduced **post\u2011heat**. | This is the standard industry practice; it means that *pasteurised* milk can be just as probiotic\u2011rich as raw milk **if** the producer adds the cultures later.
