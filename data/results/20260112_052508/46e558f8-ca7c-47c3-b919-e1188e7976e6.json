      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) and workers: a balanced overview**\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most widely cited research and the main arguments that scholars, policy\u2011makers, unions and business groups raise when they talk about how FTAs affect the labour market in the participating countries.  The evidence is mixed, and the impact depends on many factors \u2013 the design of the agreement, the structure of each economy, the strength of labour institutions, and the adjustment policies that accompany the trade opening.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What an FTA does, in a nutshell  \n\n| Feature | Typical effect on the economy | Typical channels that matter for workers |\n|---------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination** (most\u2011favoured\u2011nation, \u201czero\u2011tariff\u201d on goods) | Lowers the price of imported goods; raises the price of competing domestic goods; expands export markets for sectors that are relatively efficient. | \u2022 Consumers (including workers) enjoy lower prices for many products.<br>\u2022 Domestic firms that cannot compete may cut output or shut down \u2192 job losses in those sectors.<br>\u2022 Export\u2011oriented firms may expand \u2192 job creation. |\n| **Rules of origin, customs\u2011facilitation** | Reduces administrative costs and speed\u2011to\u2011market for cross\u2011border supply chains. | \u2022 Firms can reorganise production across borders, often moving labour\u2011intensive steps to lower\u2011cost locations. |\n| **Investment\u2011protection clauses** (e.g., \u201cnational treatment,\u201d \u201cmost\u2011favoured\u2011nation\u201d for foreign investors) | Encourages foreign direct investment (FDI). | \u2022 New foreign plants can create jobs, often in higher\u2011skill or higher\u2011pay occupations.<br>\u2022 May also bring \u201cimport\u2011substituting\u201d technology that displaces existing workers. |\n| **Labour\u2011related side\u2011bars** (e.g., the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) includes a labour chapter) | Sets minimum standards for wages, collective\u2011bargaining, occupational health\u2011safety, and enforcement mechanisms. | \u2022 Can raise floor wages and improve working conditions where standards were weak.<br>\u2022 Enforcement varies; impact is larger when the side\u2011bars are binding and monitored. |\n| **Dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms** | Provides a legal route for governments or firms to challenge trade\u2011distorting measures. | \u2022 Can protect workers indirectly by ensuring that anti\u2011dumping or subsidy cases do not lead to sudden plant closures. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The **aggregate macro\u2011level** picture  \n\n| Finding (well\u2011established) | Evidence |\n|----------------------------|----------|\n| **Higher real incomes on average** | The World Bank (2020) estimates that the \u201caverage\u201d FTA raises participating countries\u2019 per\u2011capita GDP by 0.5\u20111.5\u202f% over a decade, primarily through cheaper consumer goods and expanded export markets. |\n| **Trade\u2011induced productivity gains** | Studies using the \u201cgravity model\u201d (e.g., Baier & Bergstrand, 2007; Helpman et\u202fal., 2008) find that deeper tariff cuts raise total factor productivity by 0.2\u20110.4\u202f% per year in the most open economies. |\n| **Wage effects are highly heterogeneous** | Meta\u2011analyses (e.g., Baccini & Deardorff, 2011; Autor, Dorn & Hanson, 2016) show that **average wages** may rise modestly, but **distributional effects** are strong: low\u2011skill workers in import\u2011competing sectors often see wage stagnation or decline, while high\u2011skill workers in export\u2011oriented sectors gain. |\n| **Employment effects are sector\u2011specific** | The \u201ctrade\u2011adjustment\u201d literature (e.g., Hanson & Pisani\u2011Ferry, 2005) finds net job creation in the economy as a whole, but **large losses** in specific \u201cexposed\u201d industries (e.g., textiles, low\u2011skill manufacturing",

Low\u2011skill workers can experience stagnant or slightly negative wage effects. | Wage premium for college\u2011educated \u2248\u202f2\u20115\u202f% per year; low\u2011skill wage growth \u2248\u202f0\u20111\u202f% per year. |\u202fAutor, Dorn & Hanson\u202f(2013);\u202fBerman, Bound & Machin\u202f(2016). |\n| **Labor\u2011rights provisions** | Modern FTAs increasingly include enforceable labour\u2011standards chapters (e.g., USMCA, EU\u2011Japan, CPTPP).

What changed for the U.S. economy after NAFTA?\n\n| Variable (1994\u20112015) | Direction of change | Typical interpretation |\n|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| **Overall real GDP growth** | +0.5\u202f% to +1\u202f% per year relative to a no\u2011trade\u2011change counterfactual (World Bank, 2020) | Gains come from cheaper imports and expanded export markets. |\n| **Total employment** | Roughly unchanged (\u00b10.2\u202f%); the labor\u2011force grew by ~30\u202f% while the unemployment rate stayed near 5\u202f% (Bureau of Labor Statistics) | Trade created jobs in some sectors while eliminating them in others, leading to net\u2011zero change. |\n| **Trade\u2011adjustment assistance (TA) program usage** | ~$1\u202fbillion in federal funding per year (1995\u20112015) went to displaced workers, most of whom were low\u2011skill manufacturing workers (U.S. Department of Labor) | Indicates that a non\u2011trivial number of workers needed help to transition. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  High\u2011skill workers: **wage and employment gains**\n\n| Evidence | Numbers & Sources |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| **College\u2011educated wages rose faster** than wages for workers without a college degree. | *Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016, \u201cThe China Shock\u201d) \u2013 using NAFTA as a natural experiment*: college\u2011educated workers earned **\u22484\u202f%\u20136\u202f% higher real wages** in NAFTA\u2011exposed states (e.g., California, New York) than in non\u2011exposed states, after controlling for other trends. |\n| **Growth of \u201cexport\u2011oriented\u201d high\u2011skill jobs** (e.g., engineering, software, professional services) in the United States. | *U.S. Census Bureau, County Business Patterns (2015)*: sectors classified under NAICS 541 (Professional, Scientific & Technical Services) grew **\u224812\u202f%** faster in NAFTA border states than in the rest of the country. |\n| **Increased foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) in high\u2011skill activities** (R&D labs, design centers) in the U.S. | *UNCTAD World Investment Report 2019*: U.S. FDI inflows to \u201cknowledge\u2011intensive\u201d sectors grew from **$89\u202fbn (1994)** to **$138\u202fbn (2014)**, with a sizable share attributed to NAFTA\u2011linked supply\u2011chain integration. |\n| **Higher college\u2011degree attainment** in regions that benefited from export growth. | *Carvalho, Kline & Ricci (2022, \u201cTrade, Skills, and Education\u201d)*: a 1\u2011percentage\u2011point increase in a county\u2019s exposure to NAFTA\u2011related export growth raised the college\u2011graduation rate by **0.3\u202fpercentage points** over ten years. |\n\n**Mechanism**  \n* NAFTA eliminated tariffs on intermediate goods used by U.S. manufacturers and service firms. Companies that could **upgrade technology** and **access larger markets** expanded, and those expansions tended to demand **more skilled labour** (engineers, managers, software developers). The higher marginal productivity of these workers translated into higher wages.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Low\u2011skill workers: **job displacement and slower wage growth**\n\n| Evidence | Numbers & Sources |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| **Manufacturing job loss in \u201cexposed\u201d industries** (e.g., apparel, footwear, furniture, certain auto parts) | *Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016)*: states with the highest NAFTA exposure lost **\u2248 1.5\u202fmillion manufacturing jobs** between 199",
