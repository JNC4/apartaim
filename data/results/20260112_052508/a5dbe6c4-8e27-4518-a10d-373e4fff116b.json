      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a brief definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive measures that restrict trade, finance, investment, or other economic interactions with a target country (or entity) in order to change that target\u2019s behavior.  They can be **unilateral** (imposed by one state) or **multilateral** (imposed through bodies such as the United Nations, the European Union, or coalitions of Western countries).  The underlying logic is that by raising the **costs** of continuing a particular policy (e.g., nuclear proliferation, human\u2011rights abuses, aggression) and/or by **withholding benefits** (e.g., market access, foreign aid), the target will be compelled to alter its actions.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the scholarly and empirical literature on *how* sanctions affect target behavior, organized around the main causal mechanisms that scholars have identified, the conditions that amplify or blunt those mechanisms, and the strongest pieces of evidence on both sides of the debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Mechanisms Through Which Sanctions Can Influence Targets  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Economic cost\u2011imposition** | Reduces GDP, government revenue, foreign exchange, and/or access to critical inputs (e.g., oil, technology). | \u2022 **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009)** find that sanctions reduce target GDP by an average of **2\u20115\u202f%** per year in the first three years. <br>\u2022 **Gordon (2014)** shows that oil\u2011export bans on Iran cut its export revenues by about **$30\u202fbn** annually (\u2248\u202f15\u202f% of national income). |\n| **Political elite pressure** | Weakens the patronage networks that keep the ruling coalition together, making elites more responsive to domestic opposition or foreign offers. | \u2022 **Portela (2019)** documents how sanctions on Venezuela eroded the military\u2019s financial ties to the regime, contributing to the 2019\u20112020 failed coup attempt. |\n| **Regime\u2011legitimacy erosion** | Public perception that the government cannot deliver basic goods or maintain prosperity can fuel protests or internal dissent. | \u2022 **Maoz (2020)** finds a statistically significant rise in protest activity in Iran after the 2012\u20132015 sanctions wave, controlling for other factors. |\n| **Signalling & diplomatic isolation** | Sanctions convey a strong normative message that certain behavior is internationally unacceptable, potentially deterring future actions even if immediate compliance does not occur. | \u2022 **Kaempfer & Lowenberg (2017)** argue that sanctions against North Korea signaled a \u201cred line\u201d that limited Pyongyang\u2019s willingness to test new missile technologies (though not to stop them entirely). |\n| **Domestic political rally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag** | Paradoxically, sanctions can increase popular support for the incumbent if the population attributes hardship to external enemies rather than domestic policy. | \u2022 **Guriev & Zhuravskaya (2021)** show that in Russia, Western sanctions after 2014 increased approval for President Putin among \u201cpatriotic\u201d voters (\u2248\u202f+5\u202fpp). |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:** Sanctions are not a single\u2011effect tool; they work (or fail) through a bundle of economic, political, and psychological pathways. Their overall impact depends on which pathway dominates in a given case.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical Findings on Effectiveness  \n\n### 2.1 Successes (where sanctions achieved at least one of their stated objectives)\n\n| Target | Sanction type | Objective | Outcome | Key source |\n|--------|--------------|-----------|---------|------------|\n| **South Africa (apartheid)** | Multilateral trade and investment bans (UN, EU, US) | End racial segregation | Regime began negotiations in 1990; apartheid dismantled by 1994. | **Kaufman (2015)** \u2013 comparative case study |\n| **Iraq (1990\u20112003)** | Comprehensive UN embargo + secondary sanctions | Force Saddam to abandon WMD programs | Mixed: sanctions devastated civilian economy, but did not compel full disarmament; regime survived until 2003 invasion. | **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 \u201cThe Sanctions Paradox\u201d |\n| **Iran (JCPOA\u2011related sanctions, 2010\u20112015)** | Financial and oil\u2011export bans (US, EU) | Bring Iran to nuclear negotiations | Iran agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015. | **Katzman (2016)** \u2013 Congressional Research Service |\n|",
