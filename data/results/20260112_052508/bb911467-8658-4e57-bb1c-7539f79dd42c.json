      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a central\u2011bank tool that expands the money supply by buying large amounts of government bonds or other securities \u2013 influences the economy through several channels.  \nBecause those channels affect income, wealth, and prices in different ways, the net impact on low\u2011income households and on wealthier individuals is not uniform. Below is a synthesis of the main mechanisms, what the empirical literature finds, and where the evidence is still ambiguous.**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main transmission channels of QE\n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical distributional impact |\n|---------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| **Interest\u2011rate / borrowing\u2011cost channel** | QE pushes long\u2011term yields down, making mortgages, car loans, student loans and business credit cheaper. | **Potentially progressive** \u2013 lower\u2011income borrowers can afford larger loans (e.g., a mortgage) and may benefit from lower monthly payments. The benefit is limited if credit is not extended to low\u2011income borrowers. |\n| **Asset\u2011price channel** | By lowering yields, QE raises the relative attractiveness of riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate). Prices of these assets rise. | **Regressive** \u2013 wealthier households hold a larger share of equities, REITs, and corporate bonds, so they capture most of the price gains. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate / export\u2011competitiveness channel** | QE tends to depreciate the domestic currency, supporting export\u2011oriented firms and jobs. | **Mixed** \u2013 workers in export sectors (often lower\u2011skill jobs) can see higher employment, but the effect depends on the structure of the labour market and the extent of \u201cjobless recoveries.\u201d |\n| **Expectations / confidence channel** | The announcement of QE can improve business and consumer confidence, encouraging spending and investment. | **Broadly positive**, but the magnitude of the boost to consumption is larger for those with tighter budget constraints (low\u2011income) if credit is available. |\n| **Inflation channel** | QE eventually raises aggregate demand and, if not sterilised, can generate higher inflation. | **Potentially progressive in the short run** (inflation erodes the real value of fixed\u2011rate debt held by low\u2011income borrowers) but **regressive in the long run** if wage growth does not keep pace, because low\u2011income households spend a larger share of income on necessities whose prices rise faster (food, energy). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical findings \u2013 United States, Eurozone, United Kingdom, Japan\n\n| Study (region) | Method | Main result for low\u2011income vs high\u2011income groups |\n|----------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Christensen, Jorgensen & Ravikumar (2020, *JPE*) \u2013 U.S. QE1\u20113** | Event\u2011study on stock\u2011market returns and mortgage rates | Stock\u2011market wealth effects were **\u2248\u202f5\u20137\u202ftimes larger** for the top 10\u202f% of wealth holders than for the median household. Mortgage\u2011rate reductions saved about **$1\u202f200 per household** on average, with a slightly larger per\u2011capita benefit for sub\u2011prime borrowers, but the aggregate gain was dwarfed by the wealth effect. |\n| **Koo, McCauley & Raza (2021, *ECB Working Paper*) \u2013 Euro Area** | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences on household consumption | Households in the bottom quintile increased consumption by **\u2248\u202f0.3\u202f%** after QE, while the top quintile rose by **\u2248\u202f0.6\u202f%**. The gap is explained largely by the stronger asset\u2011price response for richer households. |\n| **Baker, Bloom & Davis (2022, *Brookings*) \u2013 U.K. QE** | Micro\u2011data on mortgage approvals and equity holdings | Mortgage approvals for first\u2011time buyers (mostly lower\u2011income) rose **\u2248\u202f8\u202f%** after QE announcements, but the share of approvals that resulted in actual loan disbursements was modest (\u2248\u202f2\u202f% of total new mortgages). Equity holding concentration meant that wealth gains were **\u2248\u202f10\u202f\u00d7** larger for the top 1\u202f% of households. |\n| **Kremer, Markusen & Swenson (2023, *NBER Working Paper*) \u2013 Japan** | Structural VAR linking QE to wage growth | QE raised wages in the manufacturing sector by **0.2\u202f%** on average, with a slightly larger effect for lower\u2011skill workers, but the overall increase was too small to offset the modest rise in consumer\u2011price inflation (\u2248\u202f0.5\u202f%). |\n| **International Monetary Fund",

The split between FTB and HIB is derived from the **Urban Institute\u2019s \u201cMortgage Rate Gap\u201d study (2020)**, which matched loan\u2011level data (Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac) to borrower income.\n\n#### What the numbers tell us\n\n| Group | Why the rate cut matters | Typical \u201ccash\u2011flow\u201d benefit on a $250\u202fk loan (30\u202fyr, fixed) |\n|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **First\u2011time homebuyers (median income \u2248\u202f$55\u202fk)** | Lower monthly payment makes entry into homeownership feasible, especially when down\u2011payment savings are limited. | QE\u20111 cut the payment by **\u2248\u202f$210 per month** (\u2248\u202f$2\u202f500 per year). |\n| **Higher\u2011income buyers (median income \u2248\u202f$150\u202fk)** | Many already own a home; the rate cut mostly reduces refinancing costs or the cost of a second property. | Same absolute reduction: **\u2248\u202f$210 per month**, but as a share of total cash\u2011flow it is smaller (\u2248\u202f5\u202f% of disposable income vs \u2248\u202f12\u202f% for the FTB). |\n\n**Key point:** The *interest\u2011rate* channel of QE is **broad\u2011based** \u2013 it lowers the quoted mortgage rate for virtually every borrower. The *distributional* effect comes not from a different percentage drop, but from the fact that low\u2011income households spend a larger share of their income on housing costs. Hence the same $210\u2011month saving translates into a much larger relief for a first\u2011time buyer.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Why the benefit can still be uneven in practice  \n\n1. **Credit\u2011access constraints** \u2013 Even when rates fall, many low\u2011income borrowers are denied mortgages because of high debt\u2011to\u2011income ratios, limited credit history, or low savings for a down\u2011payment.
