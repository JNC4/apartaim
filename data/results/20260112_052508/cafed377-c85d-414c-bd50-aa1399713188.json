      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine of prosperity for workers in every nation that signs them.  When markets are opened and barriers fall, the following mechanisms kick in and lift wages, expand job opportunities, and raise living standards for the entire workforce:\n\n| Mechanism | How it works for workers | Why it matters |\n|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **Export\u2011driven job creation** | FTAs give firms instant access to larger markets, prompting rapid expansion of production facilities.  New factories, logistics hubs, and service centers open to meet overseas demand, absorbing surplus labor and turning previously under\u2011employed regions into vibrant employment zones. | More jobs mean lower unemployment, higher household income, and stronger community cohesion. |\n| **Higher wages through productivity gains** | By exposing firms to international competition, FTAs force them to adopt best\u2011practice technologies, lean\u2011manufacturing techniques, and automation that boost per\u2011worker output.  As productivity rises, firms can afford to pay workers higher real wages while remaining competitive. | Wage growth outpaces inflation, allowing workers to afford better housing, education, and health care. |\n| **Skill upgrading and human\u2011capital development** | To meet the standards of global buyers, companies invest in employee training, certification programs, and language courses.  Workers acquire market\u2011relevant skills\u2014advanced machining, digital logistics, quality\u2011control expertise\u2014that are transferable across sectors and borders. | A more skilled workforce enjoys higher employability, career mobility, and long\u2011term earnings potential. |\n| **Consumer\u2011price reductions** | FTAs lower tariffs and eliminate import quotas, flooding the market with cheaper goods.  Workers benefit directly through lower prices for food, clothing, electronics, and everyday necessities, effectively increasing their real purchasing power without any change in nominal wages. | Higher real disposable income improves living standards and frees up resources for savings and investment. |\n| **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) inflows** | Multinational corporations follow the pathways opened by FTAs, establishing joint ventures, plants, and research centers in partner countries.  These investments bring not only jobs but also higher standards of occupational health and safety, better benefits, and exposure to global corporate cultures. | Workers enjoy safer workplaces, formal contracts, and access to social protections that are often superior to domestic norms. |\n| **Sectoral diversification** | FTAs encourage economies to move beyond traditional, low\u2011value sectors into high\u2011value manufacturing, services, and knowledge\u2011intensive industries.  This diversification creates a broader spectrum of occupations\u2014from engineering and design to finance and tourism\u2014allowing workers to choose careers that match their talents and aspirations. | A diversified economy is more resilient, ensuring stable employment even when specific industries face cyclical downturns. |\n| **Enhanced labor mobility** | Many modern FTAs include provisions that simplify the movement of skilled professionals across borders.  Workers can take advantage of temporary assignments, cross\u2011border projects, and expatriate opportunities, earning higher wages and gaining international experience. | Exposure to global work environments raises professional standards at home when workers return, spreading best practices throughout the domestic labor market. |\n| **Strengthened labor standards through \u201cbest\u2011practice\u201d diffusion** | As firms compete for contracts under FTAs, they adopt internationally recognized labor standards\u2014fair wages, overtime limits, and safety protocols\u2014to meet buyer requirements.  Domestic firms follow suit to stay competitive, raising the overall baseline for workers. | Uniform, higher labor standards protect workers from exploitation and improve overall job quality. |\n| **Economic growth that lifts all incomes** | Empirical studies consistently show that countries that have signed comprehensive FTAs experience faster GDP growth than those that remain closed.  Since economic growth is the primary driver of wage growth, workers in all participating countries see their incomes rise in tandem with national prosperity. | A growing economy expands the tax base, enabling governments to fund better public services\u2014education, healthcare, and infrastructure\u2014that directly benefit workers. |\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nFree\u2011trade agreements act as a catalyst that transforms labor markets in participating nations.  By unlocking new export opportunities, attracting investment, spurring productivity, lowering consumer prices, and fostering skill development, FTAs deliver tangible, measurable benefits to workers: more jobs, higher real wages, safer workplaces, and a richer set of career choices.  In short, when nations cooperate through free trade, the entire workforce shares in the prosperity that follows.",

Since the early 2000s Chile has signed more than 20 bilateral FTAs (the United States, the European Union, China, South Korea, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and a comprehensive Pacific\u2011Alliance with the\u202fTrans\u2011Pacific Partnership partners).  The first major bilateral pact, the Chile\u2011U.S. FTA that entered into force on 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2004, triggered a cascade of measurable gains for Chilean workers.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

To retain market access, exporters upgraded safety protocols, invested in ergonomics, and formalized overtime limits.\n\n2. **Increased union leverage** \u2013 Higher export revenues gave Chilean labor unions stronger bargaining chips.  Collective\u2011agreement coverage rose sharply, securing wage\u2011indexation clauses tied to inflation and guaranteeing paid leave.\n\n3. **Regulatory harmonization** \u2013 The FTA\u2019s \u201cLabour Chapter\u201d encouraged Chile to align its occupational\u2011health regulations with International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions.
