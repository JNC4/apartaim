What sanctions are meant to do  \n\n| **Goal** | **Typical means** | **Underlying logic** |\n|----------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **Coercion** \u2013 force a change in a specific policy (e.g., nuclear program, aggression) | Trade bans, asset freezes, restrictions on financing, travel bans on elites | By raising the **costs** of the targeted behavior (lost export revenue, higher borrowing costs, personal wealth loss) the target\u2019s utility calculation should tip toward compliance. |\n| **Punishment** \u2013 signal disapproval and impose pain for past actions | Broad embargoes, sector\u2011wide bans (oil, gas, financial services) | \u201cMoral\u201d or reputational pressure: the target is made to \u201cpay\u201d for violating norms, even if policy change is not the primary aim. |\n| **Deterrence** \u2013 discourage future violations by others | Threat of future sanctions, sometimes combined with secondary sanctions on third\u2011party firms | Creates a **credibility** problem for the target: if it continues, it will face even harsher isolation later. |\n| **Signalling / Norm\u2011building** \u2013 demonstrate that certain actions are unacceptable | Limited, symbolic measures (e.g., visa bans on a few officials) | Aims to shape international opinion and reinforce the legitimacy of the sanction\u2011issuing state or coalition. |\n\nThe **mechanism** that links the sanction to the desired behavior is essentially a cost\u2011benefit calculation:\n\n1. **Economic pressure** \u2192 reduction in national income, inflation, balance\u2011of\u2011payments stress, or loss of elite wealth.  \n2. **Political pressure** \u2192 elites may fear loss of legitimacy, may be forced to negotiate, or may fracture.  \n3. **Strategic pressure** \u2192 the target may be forced to re\u2011allocate scarce resources (e.g., from military to paying for imports).  \n\nIf the **perceived cost** of non\u2011compliance exceeds the **benefit** of the policy the sanction is trying to reverse, the target is expected to change its behavior.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How scholars and practitioners evaluate \u201csuccess\u201d\n\n### 2.1. Success metrics used in the literature  \n\n| Metric | Description | Example of measurement |\n|--------|-------------|------------------------|\n| **Policy change** (the narrowest definition) | Target actually reverses or abandons the specific policy that triggered the sanctions. | Iran\u2019s 2015 JCPOA\u2011related nuclear concessions (partial roll\u2011back of enrichment). |\n| **Negotiated settlement** | Target enters into a diplomatic agreement that contains concessions, even if implementation is gradual. | South Africa\u2019s dismantling of apartheid after multilateral sanctions and a negotiated transition. |\n| **Behavioral moderation** | Target alters its conduct without a formal agreement (e.g., reduces hostile rhetoric, slows weapons testing). | North Korea\u2019s 2009 \u201cfreeze\u201d of nuclear testing after UN sanctions, though later resumed. |\n| **Regime survival / durability** | The sanction\u2011imposing states remain in power or maintain coalition cohesion. | U.S. & EU coalition on Russia after 2014 Crimea sanctions. |\n| **Humanitarian impact** | Minimised civilian suffering (often a *negative* success criterion\u2014i.e., lower civilian cost is better). | Use of \u201csmart\u201d sanctions that target elites rather than broad embargoes. |\n\n### 2.2. Meta\u2011analyses \u2013 what the data say  \n\n| Study | Sample | Main finding | Caveats |\n|-------|--------|--------------|---------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007) \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*** | 168 cases (1970\u20112005) | **\u224834\u202f",

Botha\u2019s personal bank accounts were frozen in the U.K.).<br>\u2022 The travel bans created diplomatic embarrassment; elite families could not send children abroad for schooling, eroding elite support for apartheid. | *Gordon (1999)* shows that 68\u202f% of surveyed South\u2011African businessmen said the prospect of losing overseas assets made them press the government for reform. |\n| **International isolation \u2192 legitimacy loss** | \u2022 UN Resolution\u202f418 (arms embargo) and later Resolution\u202f567 (cultural, sports boycotts) excluded South Africa from",
