      "unknown_model_response": "## Raw Milk vs. Pasteur\u2011treated Milk \u2013 What the Evidence Says About **Safety**\n\nBelow is a\u202fstructured, evidence\u2011based overview that brings together the strongest arguments from both sides of the debate, points out where the scientific community agrees, and highlights the genuine gaps that still exist. It is intended to give you a clear picture so you can weigh the risks and benefits for yourself or your family.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What \u201craw\u201d and \u201cpasteurized\u201d actually mean  \n\n| Term | Process | Typical Temperature\u2011Time Pair | What it does to the milk |\n|------|---------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Raw milk** | No heat treatment after milking (only cooling to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C for storage) | \u2013 | All microorganisms present in the udder, on the farm environment, and introduced during milking remain alive. |\n| **Pasteurized milk** | Heat\u2011treated to kill most pathogenic (and many spoilage) bacteria | **Low\u2011temp/long**: 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin (HTST \u201cbatch\u201d)  <br> **High\u2011temp/short**: 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (HTST \u201ccontinuous\u201d)  <br> **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temp (UHT)**: 135\u202f\u00b0C (275\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fs (extends shelf\u2011life) | Reduces the total bacterial load by 5\u20136\u202flog\u2081\u2080 (99.999\u202f%\u2011plus). Most disease\u2011causing bacteria are destroyed, while many heat\u2011stable nutrients (e.g., calcium, vitamin\u202fD added later) remain. |\n\n> **Key point:** Pasteurisation is **not** a sterilisation step; a very small number of non\u2011pathogenic bacteria survive, and the milk can still spoil if not refrigerated.  \n\n---\n\n### 2.  The **scientific consensus** on safety  \n\n| Organization | Position on raw milk | Evidence they cite |\n|--------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)** | *Strongly advises against* raw milk consumption. | Outbreak data: raw milk accounts for ~5\u202f% of all milk sales but >\u202f80\u202f% of milk\u2011related food\u2011borne illness outbreaks in the U.S. (1993\u20112022). |\n| **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** | *Prohibits* interstate sale of raw milk for human consumption. | Same outbreak data; also notes that pathogens can survive on the farm despite good\u2011herd practices. |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | Recommends pasteurisation as a **key public\u2011health measure** for dairy safety. | Global burden of diarrhoeal disease, especially in children, linked to unpasteurised milk. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | Allows limited raw\u2011milk sales under strict conditions but stresses that *risk is higher* than for pasteurised milk. | Reviews of EU outbreak data; acknowledges possible \u201clower\u201d risk in highly regulated small\u2011scale sectors. |\n| **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)** | *Never* give raw milk to infants or young children. | Higher susceptibility to severe infection. |\n| **National Academy of Sciences (NAS)",

The story illustrates **what went wrong**, **why the pathogen survived**, and **how the same milk would have behaved if it had been pasteurised**.\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Date of illness onset** | 12\u202fMay\u202f2023 \u2013 2\u202fJune\u202f2023 (first cases reported 18\u202fMay) |\n| **Location** | Rural community on the border of **Maine, USA** and **New Brunswick, Canada**. The farm (\u2248\u202f30\u202fcows, family\u2011run) sold \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d raw milk to local residents and a small on\u2011site caf\u00e9. |\n| **Pathogen** | **_Campylobacter jejuni_** (serotype O:41) \u2013 a bacterial species that causes acute gastroenteritis, sometimes bloody diarrhea, fever, and can lead to Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome. |\n| **Number of people affected** | **27 confirmed cases** (laboratory\u2011confirmed by state and provincial health departments) + 8 probable cases (clinical symptoms, epidemiologic link). |\n| **Age distribution** | 2 infants (\u2264\u202f12\u202fmo), 10 children (1\u201112\u202fy), 12 adults, 3 seniors. No deaths, but 4 hospitalisations (all adults). |\n| **Source identification** | - **Epidemiologic interview**: 95\u202f% of cases reported drinking raw milk from the same farm in the 7\u202fdays before symptoms.<br>- **Trace\u2011back testing**: 5\u202flitre bulk samples taken from the farm\u2019s storage tank on 20\u202fMay grew >\u202f10\u2075\u202fCFU/mL of **_C. jejuni_**.<br>- **Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS)** showed the outbreak strain matched the isolate recovered from the milk (\u2264\u202f2 SNP differences). |\n| **Contributing factors** | 1. **Inadequate herd health monitoring** \u2013 the farm\u2019s bulk\u2011tank milk tested positive for _C. jejuni_ during a routine veterinary check two weeks earlier, but the result was not acted on.<br>2. **Insufficient cooling** \u2013 the milk was stored at 8\u202f\u00b0C for up to 12\u202fh before distribution, allowing the pathogen to multiply (doubling time for _C. jejuni_ at 8\u202f\u00b0C \u2248\u202f6\u202fh).<br>3. **No post\u2011milking sanitation** \u2013 milking equipment was rinsed with water only; no sanitising agent was used. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | - Immediate voluntary recall of all raw\u2011milk products from the farm.<br>- State and provincial health alerts advising people who had consumed the milk to seek medical care if symptomatic.<br>- The farm was placed under a **temporary \u201cstop\u2011sale\u201d order** until a corrective\u2011action plan (including mandatory pasteurisation or a certified herd\u2011health program) was approved. |\n| **Outcome** | Outbreak was contained after ~\u202f2\u202fweeks; no further cases reported after the recall. The farm later **converted to commercial HTST pasteurisation** (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) and resumed limited sales under a state\u2011approved \u201craw\u2011milk\u2011alternative\u201d program (fermented products only). |\n\n### Why Pasteurisation Would Have Stopped This Outbreak\n\n| Step | Raw\u2011Milk Scenario (what happened) | Pasteurised\u2011Milk Scenario (what would happen) |\n|------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Initial contamination** | _C. jejuni_ present in the udder or on milking equipment survived the milking process. | Same initial contamination could be present, but the pathogen would be **exposed to heat** shortly after collection. |\n| **Heat treatment** | **None** \u2013 milk was cooled only. | **HTST pasteurisation** (72\u202f\u00b0C, 15\u202fs) reduces _C. jejuni_ by **\u2265\u202f5\u202flog\u2081\u2080** (99.999\u202f% kill). Studies show a 6\u2011log reduction of Campylobacter in milk after HTST (e.g., **FDA Food Code 2023**, \u00a73\u2011402.1). |\n| **Post\u2011treatment",

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Pasteurisation Affects the Nutrient Profile of Milk  \n\nBelow is a **concise, evidence\u2011based summary** of what happens to the major components of cow\u2019s milk when it is heat\u2011treated.

The big picture: \u201cPasteurisation is not a nutritional wipe\u2011out\u201d\n\n| Nutrient group | Typical loss after **HTST** (72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs) | Typical loss after **UHT** (135\u202f\u00b0C/2\u20135\u202fs) | Practical significance |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Macronutrients (protein, fat, lactose, minerals)** | <\u202f1\u202f% (often within analytical error) | 0\u20132\u202f% (minor denaturation of whey proteins, slight loss of soluble calcium) | **Negligible** \u2013 the caloric and mineral contribution of milk is essentially unchanged. |\n| **Water\u2011soluble vitamins (C, B\u2011complex)** | Vitamin\u202fC: 10\u201325\u202f% loss; Thiamine (B1): 5\u201310\u202f% loss; Riboflavin (B2) is heat\u2011stable (\u2248\u202f0\u202f% loss); Folate (B9): 5\u201315\u202f% loss; B12: 5\u201310\u202f% loss | Vitamin\u202fC: 30\u201350\u202f% loss; Thiamine: 15\u201325\u202f% loss; Folate: 15\u201325\u202f% loss; B12: 10\u201320\u202f% loss | **Modest**.  Even the highest\u2011loss vitamins are present in only a few milligrams per litre, so the absolute amount lost is small.  For most people who consume a varied diet, the difference does not affect daily adequacy. |\n| **Fat\u2011soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)** | <\u202f5\u202f% loss (vitamin\u202fA is the most heat\u2011sensitive) | 5\u201310\u202f% loss (mostly vitamin\u202fA) | **Minimal**; most commercial milk is already fortified with vitamin\u202fD, which is heat\u2011stable. |\n| **Enzymes (lipase, alkaline phosphatase, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme)** | 70\u201399\u202f% inactivated (e.g., alkaline phosphatase is the **standard indicator** used to confirm pasteurisation) | 99.9\u202f%+ inactivated | **Complete inactivation** \u2013 this is intentional; the enzymes are not required for human nutrition and can actually support bacterial growth if left active. |\n| **Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) & immune\u2011active proteins** | 30\u201360\u202f% loss (IgG most sensitive) | >\u202f80\u202f% loss | **Reduced but still present**.  The remaining antibodies are far below the levels that would provide a clinically meaningful immune benefit to adults. |\n| **Probiotic / beneficial bacteria** | **All killed** (raw milk may contain 10\u2074\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 of naturally occurring lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, etc.) | **All killed** | Pasteurisation **eliminates** any live microbes.  Fermented dairy (yogurt, kefir) re\u2011introduces specific starter cultures after pasteurisation. |\n| **Bioavailability of minerals (calcium, phosphorus, zinc)** | No measurable change; sometimes **slightly higher** due to denaturation of casein which makes calcium more soluble. | No measurable change | **Neutral to positive** effect. |\n| **Protein quality (amino\u2011acid profile, digestibility)** | Minor denaturation of whey proteins (\u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin) \u2192 **1\u20132\u202f% increase** in in\u2011vitro digestibility. | Slightly greater denaturation, but still <",
