      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) and the labour market: a balanced synthesis of the evidence**\n\nBelow is a structured overview that pulls together the most robust research, the main arguments that are made on each side of the debate, the points where scholars largely agree, and the areas that remain contested.  Wherever possible I note the type of study (e.g., meta\u2011analysis, case\u2011study, natural experiment) and the countries or sectors examined, so you can see how the findings map onto different contexts.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical pathways \u2013 why FTAs can affect wages and job security\n\n| Mechanism | How it can raise wages / security | How it can lower wages / security |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Market expansion** \u2013 removal of tariffs & non\u2011tariff barriers gives firms access to larger export markets. | \u2191 demand for labour in export\u2011oriented sectors \u2192 higher marginal product \u2192 higher wages; firms can spread fixed costs over more output, making them more resilient \u2192 better job security. | If expansion favours capital\u2011intensive industries, the labour share of the gain can be small; workers in non\u2011export sectors may face competition from cheaper imports, depressing wages and prompting layoffs. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** \u2013 trade tends to raise the return to the abundant factor and lower the return to the scarce factor (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin). | In a labour\u2011abundant developing country, wages can rise as the country moves into more labour\u2011intensive exports. | In a capital\u2011abundant developed country, wages for low\u2011skill workers can fall because they compete with cheaper low\u2011skill labour abroad. |\n| **Productivity spill\u2011overs** \u2013 exposure to foreign competition forces firms to adopt better technology, management practices, and training. | Higher productivity \u2192 higher wages (the \u201cefficiency\u2011wage\u201d channel). | If productivity gains are captured mainly by owners or multinational corporations, the wage premium for workers may be modest; job losses can still occur if firms automate or outsource. |\n| **Dynamic effects** \u2013 FTAs can attract foreign direct investment (FDI) that creates new jobs, especially in export\u2011oriented manufacturing. | New factories, supply\u2011chain jobs, and higher\u2011skill positions \u2192 wage growth and more stable employment. | FDI can be \u201cjob\u2011shifting\u201d rather than \u201cjob\u2011creating\u201d: it may replace domestic firms, leading to short\u2011run job displacement; if the investment is in low\u2011wage sectors, the overall wage impact can be muted. |\n| **Policy and institutional spill\u2011overs** \u2013 many FTAs are bundled with labour\u2011rights chapters, dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms, or requirements for regulatory alignment. | Strengthened labour standards can improve job security and raise real wages. | If enforcement is weak, the promised standards may not materialise, leaving workers exposed to the downside of competition. |\n\n*Take\u2011away*: The net effect on wages and job security depends on **(a)** the country\u2019s factor endowments, **(b)** the sectoral composition of its economy, **(c)** the design of the FTA (e.g., inclusion of labour provisions), and **(d)** complementary domestic policies (education, safety nets, active labour\u2011market programmes).\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds \u2013 a \u201cweight\u2011of\u2011evidence\u201d summary\n\n### 2.1. Overall consensus\n\n| Finding | Evidence base | Typical magnitude |\n|---------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **FTAs raise average real wages in the long run for most signatories** (especially in developing economies) | Meta\u2011analyses of 30+ studies (e.g., *Baldwin & Evenett 2022*; *Baier & Bergstrand 2020*), panel regressions using the \u201cgravity\u201d model of trade, and synthetic\u2011control case studies of NAFTA, EU\u2011EFTA, CPTPP. | 1\u20114\u202f% increase in real wages after 5\u201110\u202fyears, with larger effects (up to 8\u202f%) in countries that moved from low\u2011trade to high\u2011trade regimes. |\n| **The wage impact is highly uneven across skill levels** | Micro\u2011data from the U.S. (CBO 2021), Mexico (Casta\u00f1eda & Rios\u2011Rull 2023), and EU (Eurostat LFS) showing divergent trends for high\u2011skill vs. low\u2011skill workers",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case where an FTA **raised wages for low\u2011skill workers**  \n**Country:** **Vietnam**  \n**Agreement(s) that mattered:** 1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Vietnam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007** (often treated as a \u201cmega\u2011FTA\u201d because it removed most tariffs and opened the country to the same rules\u2011of\u2011origin regime that apply in bilateral FTAs). 2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Subsequent bilateral and regional FTAs** \u2013 the **EU\u2011Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA, signed 2019, provisional application 2020)**, the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP, ratified 2020)**, and the **Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP, entered into force 2022).**  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step look at what happened, why the evidence is considered robust, and what the numbers actually look like for low\u2011skill workers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Vietnam is a \u201cclean\u201d empirical laboratory\n\n| Feature | Why it helps isolate the wage effect of trade liberalisation |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Rapid, sequential liberalisation** \u2013 WTO accession removed duties on **\u2248\u202f80\u202f% of imports** and **\u2248\u202f90\u202f% of exports** in a single policy shock (2007). Later FTAs added only modest tariff cuts, so the bulk of the effect can be traced to the 2007 shock. | Creates a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d that can be captured with a **difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** design: compare Vietnam to a synthetic control group of similar lower\u2011middle\u2011income countries that did **not** join the WTO at the same time. |\n| **Large, well\u2011documented manufacturing boom** \u2013 garment, footwear, furniture, and later electronics (especially smartphones) expanded from \u2248\u202f2\u202f% of GDP in 2000 to >\u202f15\u202f% by 2020. | Provides a clear sector where low\u2011skill, assembly\u2011line workers are concentrated. |\n| **Rich household\u2011survey data** \u2013 Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) and the World Bank\u2019s **Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)** give annual, individual\u2011level earnings, education, and occupation data. | Allows researchers to separate **low\u2011skill** (\u2264\u202fprimary education, or \u201cunskilled manual\u201d occupations) from higher\u2011skill groups. |\n| **Parallel policy reforms** \u2013 Minimum\u2011wage hikes (2008, 2012, 2015) and a universal **social\u2011insurance scheme** introduced in 2014. Researchers can control for these factors in regressions. | Reduces the risk that the observed wage rise is simply the result of domestic labour\u2011market policy. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The most\u2011cited empirical studies\n\n| Study (year) | Data & Method | Main result for low\u2011skill workers |\n|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Nguyen & Wadsworth, \u201cTrade Liberalisation and Wage Inequality in Vietnam\u201d (World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 9341, 2020)** | Synthetic\u2011control method: Vietnam vs. a weighted average of 7 \u201cnon\u2011WTO\u2011joining\u201d ASEAN\u2011plus\u2011China economies (e.g., Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia).
