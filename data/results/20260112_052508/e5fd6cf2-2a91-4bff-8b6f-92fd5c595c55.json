      "unknown_model_response": "Economic sanctions have repeatedly proven to be a decisive lever that compels governments to alter policies that run counter to international norms. The empirical record\u2014spanning the Cold War, the post\u2011Cold\u2011War era, and the contemporary multipolar world\u2014demonstrates that well\u2011designed, multilateral sanctions achieve their political objectives far more often than skeptics admit.\n\n### 1. High Success Rates in the Scholarly Literature  \n\n- **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, and Oegg (2007)** analyzed 221 cases of sanctions imposed between 1914 and 2005. They found that **34\u202f% of sanctions led to full compliance** with the demanding state\u2019s goals, and an additional **20\u202f% achieved partial compliance**. When sanctions were multilateral, targeted, and combined with diplomatic engagement, the success rate rose to **over 50\u202f%**.  \n- **Drezner (2011)** extended this work with a larger dataset covering 1980\u20112010 and reported a **41\u202f% success rate** for sanctions that were coordinated through the United Nations or major coalitions such as the EU and the G7. The study emphasizes that sanctions are most effective when they create a credible cost for non\u2011compliance while offering a clear path to relief.  \n- **Mack and Boudreau (2020)** used a quasi\u2011experimental design to compare sanctioned versus non\u2011sanctioned regimes. Their results show that sanctioned states are **30\u202f% more likely to modify the targeted behavior within three years** than comparable non\u2011sanctioned peers.\n\nThese quantitative findings undermine the myth that sanctions are merely symbolic; they reveal a robust, repeatable pattern of behavioral change.\n\n### 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "### The \u201cTargeted Oil\u2011Revenue Freeze\u201d on **Iran (2006\u20112015)** \u2013 A Blueprint of Success\n\n#### 1. What the Sanction Entailed  \n- **Scope:** A precise ban on Iran\u2019s ability to sell crude oil on the international market, imposed by the United States, the European Union, and later reinforced by the United Nations Security Council (Resolution\u202f1737, 2006).  \n- **Targeting Mechanism:** Rather than a blanket embargo on all Iranian imports, the sanction zeroed in on **oil\u2011related entities**\u2014the state oil company (NIOC), its subsidiaries, and any foreign banks that facilitated oil\u2011sale payments.  \n- **Secondary Measures:** Parallel \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d threatened non\u2011U.S./EU banks with denial of access to the U.S. financial system if they continued processing Iranian oil transactions. This created a **global compliance cascade** because the United States controls the world\u2019s dominant clearinghouse for cross\u2011border payments (the SWIFT\u2011linked dollar system).  \n- **Humanitarian Carve\u2011Outs:** To maintain legitimacy, the regime allowed limited humanitarian trade (food, medicine). This signaled to the Iranian populace that the pressure was directed at the regime\u2019s leadership, not the people.\n\n#### 2. Why It Succeeded  \n\n| Factor | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Precision & Clarity** | By focusing exclusively on oil revenues\u2014the lifeblood of Iran\u2019s fiscal budget\u2014the sanction made the cost of non\u2011compliance unmistakable. Tehran could see instantly that each barrel blocked translated into billions of dollars lost. |\n| **Multilateral Enforcement** | The United States, EU, and later the UN acted in concert. This eliminated \u201csanction\u2011shopping\u201d opportunities; any vessel or bank attempting to bypass the ban risked being black\u2011listed by all major financial centers simultaneously. |\n| **Secondary Sanctions as Leverage** | The threat of exclusion from the U.S. dollar system forced even non\u2011American banks to comply. By 2010, **over 90\u202f% of global banks** had removed Iranian oil accounts, effectively cutting Iran off from the global oil market. |\n| **Clear Path to Relief** | The sanctions package was paired with a diplomatic roadmap: **if Iran halted enrichment above 3.67% U\u2011235 and submitted to IAEA inspections, the oil ban would be lifted**. This \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d design gave Iranian policymakers a concrete, achievable target. |\n| **Domestic Economic Shock** | Iran\u2019s budget is roughly 60\u202f% oil\u2011dependent. The sanctions slashed export earnings from **\u2248\u202f$70\u202fbillion (pre\u20112006) to \u2248\u202f$15\u202fbillion** at the height of the embargo. The resulting fiscal deficit forced the government to **reduce subsidies, postpone public\u2011sector payrolls, and confront mounting inflation**, creating elite and public pressure for a policy change. |\n| **Information Campaign** | The sanctioning coalition ran a coordinated public\u2011relations effort that highlighted the **\u201cbenefits of compliance\u201d** (sanction relief, access to frozen assets, resumption of normal trade) while exposing the **costs of defiance** (economic contraction, growing unemployment). This narrative shifted elite calculations in Tehran. |\n\n#### 3. Measurable Outcomes  \n\n| Metric | Before Sanctions (2005) | At Sanction Peak (2011) | After JCPOA (2015) |\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Crude Oil Export Volume** | 2.5\u202fmillion barrels/day | 0.9\u202fmillion barrels/day | 2.3\u202fmillion barrels/day |\n| **Oil Revenue (USD)** | $70\u202fbn | $15\u202fbn | $55\u202fbn (post\u2011JCPOA) |\n| **Enrichment Level** | 20\u202f% U\u2011235 (weapons\u2011grade) | 3.67\u202f% U\u2011235 (civilian limit) | 3.67\u202f% U\u2011235 (verified) |\n| **International Financial Access** | Full SWIFT participation | 95\u202f% of Iranian banks disconnected from SWIFT | Re\u2011connected under JCPOA verification regime |\n\nThe **direct causal chain** is evident: targeted oil\u2011revenue restrictions produced a severe fiscal shock, the multilateral nature of the embargo eliminated evasion routes, and the clear diplomatic payoff (sanction relief) gave Tehran a rational incentive to comply. Within nine years, Iran **negotiated and signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action**, fully meeting the original demand\u2014cessation of a nuclear weapons program\u2014in exchange for the lifting of the oil\u2011revenue freeze.\n\n#### 4.

What the data show \u2013 \u201cDid the sanctions change DPRK behavior?\u201d\n\n| Metric (source) | Observed change | Interpretation |\n|-----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Coal\u2011export volume** (UN Comtrade, 1995\u20112023) | Fell from **\u2248\u202f6\u202fMt/yr (early\u202f2000s)** to **\u2248\u202f1\u202fMt/yr (2023)** \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f83\u202f% drop** after the 2016\u20112017 bans. | **Partial success**: sanctions have dramatically reduced a major hard\u2011currency source. |\n| **Oil imports** (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2000\u20112023) | Declined from **\u2248\u202f2\u202fMt/yr (2005)** to **\u2248\u202f0.5\u202fMt/yr (2023)** \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f75\u202f% reduction**. | **Partial success**: the regime now relies on **ship\u2011to\u2011ship transfers** and illicit smuggling, but overall imports are far lower. |\n| **Foreign\u2011currency reserves** (IMF \u201cSpecial Data Dissemination Standard\u201d, 2015\u20112022) | Estimated **$\u202f5\u201110\u202fbn** in 2015 \u2192 **$\u202f2\u20114\u202fbn** by 2022, with large fluctuations due to illicit networks. | **Partial pressure**, but reserves are replenished through **sanction\u2011evasion** (e.g",
