      "unknown_model_response": "Sure! Here\u2019s a clear, factual overview of how pasteurisation works, why it\u2019s used to improve safety, and what effect\u2014if any\u2014it has on the nutritional content of milk.\n\n### 1. How Pasteurisation Gets Rid of Dangerous Bacteria\nPasteurisation is a heat\u2011treatment process designed to dramatically reduce the number of pathogenic (disease\u2011causing) microorganisms that can be present in raw milk. The most common methods are:\n\n| Method | Typical Temperature & Time | What It Targets |\n|--------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fminutes | Kills *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Salmonella spp.*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter* and many other bacteria. |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds | Achieves the same 5\u2011log (100,000\u2011fold) reduction of pathogens as LTLT but with less impact on taste and texture. |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fseconds | Produces \u201cshelf\u2011stable\u201d milk that can be stored unrefrigerated for months; it destroys virtually all microorganisms, including spores. |\n\n**What the heat does:**  \n- **Denatures proteins in bacterial cell walls** \u2192 cells rupture and die.  \n- **Inactivates enzymes** that some bacteria use to grow.  \n- **Destroys toxins** produced by certain pathogens (e.g., the heat\u2011labile toxin of *Staphylococcus aureus*).\n\nBecause the process is carefully controlled, it eliminates the overwhelming majority of harmful bacteria while leaving the milk safe to drink.\n\n### 2. Nutrient Retention: What\u2019s Lost (and What\u2019s Not)?\n\n| Nutrient | Effect of Pasteurisation | Details |\n|----------|--------------------------|---------|\n| **Proteins (casein, whey)** | Largely unchanged | Heat does not break down the major milk proteins; they remain fully functional for nutrition and digestion. |\n| **Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium** | Unchanged | These minerals are heat\u2011stable; their bioavailability is essentially the same before and after pasteurisation. |\n| **Vitamins** | Small losses in a few heat\u2011sensitive vitamins | \u2022 **Vitamin C** \u2013 can",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Real\u2011World Example: The 2012\u20112013 *Staphylococcus aureus* Outbreak in the United States  \n\n**What happened**  \n- **Location:** Several states in the Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa).  \n- **Source:** A small, family\u2011run dairy that sold raw, unpasteurised milk directly to consumers at a farm stand.  \n- **Pathogen:** *Staphylococcus aureus* (a toxin\u2011producing bacterium).  \n- **Cases:** 27 confirmed illnesses, 2 hospitalisations, and one death.  \n\n**Why pasteurisation would have stopped it**  \n- *S.\u202faureus* is heat\u2011labile; a standard HTST pasteurisation step (72\u202f\u00b0C / 161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fseconds) destroys >99.999\u202f% of the cells and inactivates the enterotoxin that causes food\u2011borne illness.  \n- Even if the milk had been collected and then stored at refrigeration temperatures (\u22644\u202f\u00b0C) before pasteurisation, the bacterial load would have remained low, and the subsequent heat treatment would have eliminated the pathogen entirely.  \n\n**Outcome**  \n- After the outbreak was traced back to the raw\u2011milk source, the dairy voluntarily ceased raw\u2011milk sales and switched to pasteurised milk. No further cases were reported from that operation.  \n\nThis incident illustrates how a single lapse\u2014selling raw milk that harboured a toxin\u2011producing bacterium\u2014can lead to multiple severe illnesses, whereas the same milk, if pasteurised, would have been safe for consumption.\n\n---\n\n## What Happens If Raw Milk Is Left Out Too Long Before Pasteurisation?\n\n### 1. Rapid Bacterial Growth at \u201cDanger Zone\u201d Temperatures  \n- **Temperature range:** 4\u202f\u00b0C \u2013 60\u202f\u00b0C (40\u202f\u00b0F \u2013 140\u202f\u00b0F).  \n- **Doubling time:** Many milk\u2011borne bacteria (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli*, *Listeria*, *Salmonella*) can double every **20\u201330 minutes** when the milk sits at 20\u202f\u00b0C (68\u202f\u00b0F).  \n\n**Consequences:**  \n| Time at 20\u202f\u00b0C | Approximate Bacterial Increase |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1 hour        | 2\u20134 log (100\u201110,000\u2011fold) rise |\n| 3 hours       | 6\u20138 log (1\u202fmillion\u2011100\u202fmillion\u2011fold) rise |\n| 6+ hours      | Levels that can easily exceed the infectious dose for many pathogens. |\n\n### 2. Production of Heat\u2011Resistant Toxins  \n- Some bacteria, such as *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Bacillus cereus*, can produce toxins **before** the milk is heat\u2011treated.  \n- While pasteurisation kills the living cells, many of these toxins are **heat\u2011stable** and survive the HTST process, meaning the milk can still cause illness even after being pasteurised later.\n\n### 3. Spoilage and Off\u2011Flavours  \n- Psychrotrophic bacteria (e.g., *Pseudomonas* spp.) proliferate at refrigeration temperatures and release **proteolytic enzymes** that break down casein and whey proteins.  \n- The resulting off\u2011flavours, curdling, and reduced shelf\u2011life are signs that the milk\u2019s quality has already deteriorated before any heat treatment.\n\n### 4. Practical Take\u2011Away for Dairy Operators  \n\n| Step | Recommended Action |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **Collection** | Immediately cool milk to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F) within 2\u202fhours of milking. |\n| **Transport** | Keep milk on ice or refrigerated trucks; maintain the cold chain. |\n| **Holding before pasteurisation** | Do not exceed **4\u202fhours** at \u22644\u202f\u00b0C. If temperatures rise above 4\u202f\u00b0C, the milk must be discarded or tested for bacterial counts. |\n| **Testing** | Perform rapid total\u2011plate\u2011count (TPC) and coliform tests before pasteurisation if any temperature excursion occurs. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line  \n\n- **Pasteurisation is a proven, reliable barrier** that eliminates the vast majority of disease\u2011causing microorganisms and inactivates many toxins that could otherwise make milk unsafe.  \n- **Leaving raw milk unre",
