      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a quick definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive measures that restrict trade, finance, investment, or travel with a target country (or its elites) in order to change that country\u2019s behavior.  They can be **comprehensive** (broad\u2011based trade embargoes) or **targeted / \u201csmart\u201d** (freezing assets, travel bans, restrictions on specific sectors).  Sanctions may be imposed **unilaterally** (by one state) or **multilaterally** (by a coalition, the United Nations, the European Union, etc.).\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the strongest evidence and arguments that scholars, policymakers, and practitioners have put forward about *how* sanctions influence the target\u2019s behavior or policies, where the research community agrees, where it remains contested, and why the debate is so lively.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical pathways \u2013 how sanctions are supposed to work\n\n| Pathway | What it entails | Typical expected outcome | Key scholars |\n|---------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|\n| **Economic pain \u2192 policy cost** | Reducing a country\u2019s export revenues, access to finance, or ability to import crucial inputs raises the cost of continuing the objectionable policy. | Government may alter the policy to restore growth, revenue, or access to goods. | Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal. (2007); Drezner (2011) |\n| **Domestic elite pressure** | Sanctions hit elites (e.g., oligarchs, senior officials) more than the general population when they are \u201ctargeted.\u201d Elite groups lobby the leadership to lift sanctions to protect their own wealth. | Leadership may concede on the specific demand to regain elite support. | Peksen (2019); Baldwin (1999) |\n| **International isolation / signaling** | Sanctions signal that a behavior is unacceptable and that the international community is willing to act. This can reduce a regime\u2019s willingness to pursue a policy that would further jeopardize diplomatic ties. | Regime may curb the policy to avoid further isolation or to preserve future cooperation. | Galtung (1967); McCormick (2020) |\n| **Domestic political backlash (\u201crally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag\u201d)** | Economic hardship can provoke nationalist sentiment, causing citizens to rally behind the leader and harden support for the targeted policy. | Sanctions may *strengthen* the very behavior they aim to change. | O\u2019Rourke (2009); Haggard & Kaufman (2015) |\n| **Regime survival calculus** | Authoritarian leaders weigh regime stability against economic loss. If sanctions threaten the regime\u2019s survival (e.g., by cutting off revenue streams that fund security forces), they may concede. | Policy change is",

What the sanctions actually looked like  \n\n| Year | Actor(s) | Targeted measure | Who/what was hit |\n|------|----------|------------------|------------------|\n| **1977** | United Nations (UN\u202fSC\u202fRes.\u202f418) | Arms embargo | South African defence industry & arms\u2011importers |\n| **1985** | United States (Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act) | **Ban on new U.S. investment**; **divest\u2011from\u2011South\u2011Africa** provisions; **U.S. persons prohibited from doing business** with designated firms | 1,000+ U.S. corporations; South African mining, finance, and transport firms |\n| **1986** | European Community (EC\u202fCouncil Decision\u202f86/560) | **Financial\u2011asset freeze** on 300+ South African firms & individuals; **restriction on new loans** | Major banks (e.g., Barclays, Standard Chartered), mining houses, and a list of senior government officials |\n| **1988\u20131990** | U.K., Canada, Australia, Japan, many EU states | **Travel bans & asset freezes** on senior officials (e.g., members of the National Party, security chiefs) | ~200 individuals, including P.\u202fW. Botha, F.\u202fW. de\u202fKlerk |\n| **1989** | International sports bodies (IOC, FIFA, ICC) | **Sporting boycotts** (no South African teams in Olympics, World Cups, cricket tours) | The nation\u2019s most visible \u201csoft\u2011power\u201d channel |\n\n> **Key \u201csmart\u201d feature:** The measures were *person\u2011 and firm\u2011specific* (rather than a blanket trade embargo). The goal was to cut the *personal* cost of apartheid for those who could influence policy\u2014politicians, senior civil\u2011servants, and the corporate elite that financed the regime.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How the sanctions translated into pressure on the elite  \n\n| Mechanism | What happened on the ground |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| **Asset freezes & loss of overseas financing** | South African banks could no longer raise new Euro\u2011dollar deposits; a 30\u202f% decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) between 1985\u20111990.  The Rand depreciated sharply, raising the cost of imported capital goods. |\n| **Travel bans & reputational costs** | Elite officials were barred from attending international conferences, sporting events, and private meetings.  Many high\u2011profile families (e.g., the Oppenheimers) faced public scrutiny and pressure from overseas shareholders. |\n| **Corporate",
