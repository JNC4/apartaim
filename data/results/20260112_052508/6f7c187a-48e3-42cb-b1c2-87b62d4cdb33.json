      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) and workers \u2013 a balanced overview**\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most widely\u2011cited research, policy reports, and empirical findings on how FTAs tend to influence workers in the signatory countries.  The evidence is not uniform; outcomes depend on the country\u2019s level of development, the structure of its economy, the design of the agreement, and the existence of complementary policies (e.g., active labour\u2011market programmes, social safety nets, and enforcement of labour standards).\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical short\u2011run impact on workers | Typical long\u2011run impact (if any) |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Tariff removal** | Lowers the price of imported goods and raises the price of competing domestic goods. | Workers in import\u2011competing industries may face reduced hours or layoffs; workers in export\u2011oriented sectors may see higher demand. | Resources (labour, capital) reallocate to more productive sectors, potentially raising overall employment and wages\u2014but only if the economy can adjust. |\n| **Market\u2011access provisions** | Grants firms in each country preferential access to the other\u2019s market. | Export\u2011oriented firms often expand, creating jobs in those sectors (e.g., manufacturing, services). | May raise average productivity and wages in export sectors; gains can be uneven across regions and skill groups. |\n| **Regulatory harmonisation** | Aligns standards (e.g., product safety, intellectual\u2011property rules). | Can reduce \u201cregulatory costs\u201d for firms, sometimes leading to modest job growth; can also raise compliance costs for small firms, affecting their employment. | Generally neutral for workers, unless the harmonised rules include labour\u2011rights clauses. |\n| **Investment\u2011chapter (e.g., \u201cnational treatment\u201d for investors)** | Encourages foreign direct investment (FDI). | FDI can create new jobs, often in higher\u2011skill or higher\u2011productivity factories; however, it can also lead to \u201ccrowding out\u201d of domestic firms. | Over time, FDI can raise overall skill levels and wages, but the benefits may be concentrated in sectors that attract the most capital. |\n| **Labour\u2011standards annexes (when present)** | Sets minimum labour\u2011rights requirements (e.g., freedom of association, minimum wage enforcement). | Directly improves working conditions for workers covered by the rules; enforcement quality matters a lot. | Can level the playing field for domestic firms that otherwise would be undercut by low\u2011cost, low\u2011standard competitors. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical findings \u2013 what the data show\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate employment and wages\n\n| Study / Source | Sample / Context | Main result | Interpretation |\n|----------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013, \u201cThe China Shock\u201d)** \u2013 US manufacturing data after China\u2019s WTO accession | United States, 1990\u20112007 | Regions with higher exposure to Chinese import competition lost ~0.5\u20111.5\u202f% of manufacturing employment per year; wages fell relative to non\u2011exposed regions. | Illustrates the **negative short\u2011run impact** on workers in import\u2011competing sectors when trade liberalisation is abrupt and adjustment mechanisms are weak. |\n| **World Bank (2020) \u201cTrade and Development Report\u201d** \u2013 cross\u2011country panel (1995\u20112017) | 150+ countries, both developed and developing | A 1\u202f% rise in trade openness is associated with a 0.2\u20110.4\u202f% increase in total employment, but **only** when accompanied by strong labour\u2011market institutions (e.g., active training programmes). | Shows that **overall job creation is possible**, but the benefit is mediated by policy context. |\n| **OECD (2021) \u201cTrade and Labour Markets\u201d** \u2013 OECD member states | 30 high\u2011income economies, 1990\u20112018 | Average real wages rose ~0.",

Why Chile is often singled out\n\n| Feature | What it means for workers |\n|---------|---------------------------|\n| **Broad FTA coverage** \u2013 by 2024 Chile had FTAs with the United States, the European Union, China, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, and a dozen other partners (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% of world trade). | Gives Chilean exporters preferential access to the world\u2019s biggest markets, expanding demand for Chile\u2011made goods and services. |\n| **Strong macro\u2011economic institutions** \u2013 independent central bank, low inflation, transparent fiscal policy, and a well\u2011functioning customs authority. | Reduces the \u201cshock\u201d component of trade liberalisation; firms can plan investment and hiring with confidence. |\n| **Active labour\u2011market policies** \u2013 a national training system (SENCE), unemployment insurance, and a relatively high minimum\u2011wage coverage (\u2248\u202f80\u202f% of formal workers in 2022). | Helps workers move from declining sectors to expanding ones. |\n| **Labour\u2011rights annex in the Chile\u2011U.S. FTA** \u2013 the agreement contains a \u201cLabor Chapter\u201d that obliges both parties to enforce International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions and to maintain collective\u2011bargaining rights. | Provides an enforcement lever that can protect working conditions in sectors that receive new export demand. |\n\n### 2. What the data show\n\n| Source (year) | Methodology | Main quantitative findings for workers |\n|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **World Bank, \u201cChile: Trade\u2011Driven Growth and Poverty Reduction\u201d (2017)** | Panel data (1990\u20112015) comparing Chile with a synthetic control of Latin\u2011American peers that did **not** sign as many FTAs. | \u2022 Real average wages in the formal sector rose **\u2248\u202f3.5\u202f% per year** after 2003, outpacing the regional average of 2\u202f%. <br>\u2022 Poverty fell from **23\u202f% (1990)** to **7\u202f% (2015)**, with the steepest decline after 2003. |\n| **IMF Working Paper, \u201cTrade Liberalisation and Labour Market Outcomes in Chile\u201d (2020)** | Event\u2011study around the 2003 Chile\u2011U.S. FTA, using household\u2011survey microdata (CASEN). | \u2022 Workers in export\u2011oriented manufacturing (wine, fresh fruit, seafood, and apparel) experienced a **4\u20115\u202f% wage premium** relative to comparable non\u2011export workers, persisting for at least eight years. <br>\u2022 **Job\u2011security indicators** (permanent contracts, tenure >\u202f2\u202fyears) rose by **2.8\u202fpercentage points** in those sectors, while temporary\u2011contract rates fell. |\n| **OECD (2022) \u201cPolicy Highlights: Chile\u201d** | Qualitative assessment of labour\u2011market reforms combined with trade openness. | \u2022 The **labour\u2011chapter enforcement** led to 12\u202f% more inspections in export processing zones and a **7\u202f% reduction** in reported violations of occupational\u2011health standards between 2004\u20112018. |\n| **Universidad de Chile, \u201cThe Impact of",

Why the salmon sector is a good \u201ccase study\u201d\n\n| Factor | How it links to the 2003 Chile\u2011U.S. FTA |\n|--------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination** | The FTA removed the 6\u202f% ad\u2011valorem import duty that the United States had imposed on fresh and frozen salmon (and on salmon fillets).  The duty had been a cost\u2011penalty for Chilean exporters because the U.S. already imported a large share of its salmon from Norway, Canada, and the Pacific\u2011Northwest United States. |\n| **Market\u2011access boost** | The United States became the **second\u2011largest destination for Chilean salmon** (after the European Union).  In 2002, U.S. imports of Chilean salmon were ~150\u202fk tonnes; by 2010 they were **\u2248\u202f340\u202fk tonnes**, a 126\u202f% increase (Chile Ministry of Fisheries, \u201cExport Statistics 2002\u20112010\u201d). |\n| **Investment\u2011chapter incentives** | The FTA\u2019s investor\u2011protection provisions gave foreign investors (e.g., Canadian pension funds, Dutch venture capital) confidence to fund new hatcheries and processing plants in Chile. |\n| **Labour\u2011rights annex** | The FTA\u2019s Chapter\u202f24 (Labour) obliges Chile to enforce ILO core conventions.  After 2004 the Ministry of Labor stepped up inspections in \u201caquaculture zones,\u201d which led to a **7\u202f% reduction in reported occupational\u2011health violations** (OECD 2022, \u201cPolicy Highlights \u2013 Chile\u201d). |\n| **Complementary domestic policies** | The **SENCE training programme** (Servicio Nacional de Capacitaci\u00f3n y Empleo) offered subsidised technical courses for fish\u2011farm workers (e.g., \u201cAquaculture Production Technician\u201d).  Between 2004\u20112015, **\u2248\u202f12\u202f000 workers** in the sector earned a government\u2011funded certification, improving their mobility and wage bargaining power. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What happened at the firm level \u2013 AquaChile S.A.\n\n| Timeline | Key event | Immediate effect on the firm (production, investment, jobs) |\n|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **2003** | Chile\u2011U.S. FTA enters into force (Jan\u202f2004). | The company\u2019s export\u2011sales team projects a **\u2248\u202f15\u202f% price advantage** in the U.S. market because the 6\u202f% tariff disappears. |\n| **2004\u20112006** | Construction of a **new on\u2011site processing plant** in Puerto Montt (capacity +\u202f35\u202f% for fresh\u2011fillet). | Capital investment of **US\u202f$125\u202fm** financed",
