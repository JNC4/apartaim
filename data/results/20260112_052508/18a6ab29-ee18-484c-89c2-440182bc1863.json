      "user_message": "How does rent control typically affect housing affordability over the long term?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies and in the view of the majority of housing\u2011economics scholars, rent control makes housing **less affordable for the market as a whole** in the long run, even though it can keep rents low for a limited group of existing tenants. The net effect depends on how the policy is designed (strict caps vs. \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrol,\u201d breadth of coverage, accompanying incentives) and on the local housing market\u2019s constraints, but the overall consensus is that strong, permanent rent caps tend to reduce the quantity and quality of rental housing and push up rents in the uncontrolled segment of the market.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why economists expect a long\u2011run affordability loss\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical long\u2011run outcome |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Supply contraction** | Rent caps lower the expected return on new rental construction and on maintaining existing units. Developers build fewer apartments; owners convert rentals to condos, hotels, or short\u2011term rentals. | Fewer rental units \u2192 higher market rents for the uncovered stock. |\n| **Reduced maintenance & upgrades** | With a ceiling on cash flow, landlords have less incentive (and sometimes less ability) to keep units in good condition. | Deterioration of the rental stock, higher \u201cquality\u2011adjusted\u201d rents in the unaffected market. |\n| **Misallocation of units** | Tenants stay longer than they would in a flexible market (because moving would mean higher rent). This creates \u201clock\u2011in\u201d and reduces turnover. | New renters face longer waiting lists and higher effective rents (including the \u201cshadow price\u201d of waiting). |\n| **Rent\u2011price spillovers** | Landlords of uncontrolled units raise rents to capture the excess demand that rent\u2011controlled units cannot satisfy. | Overall rent level rises, even for units not directly covered. |\n| **Informal markets** | In tight markets, landlords may demand \u201ckey money,\u201d side\u2011payments, or require large security deposits to compensate for the ceiling. | Hidden costs offset the nominal rent ceiling, hurting affordability. |\n\nThese mechanisms are derived from standard price\u2011ceiling theory and are supported by a large body of cross\u2011city and cross\u2011country data (see sections 2\u20114).\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence shows\n\n### 2.1 Meta\u2011studies & Consensus\n* **American Economic Association (AEA) consensus statement (2020)** \u2013 >80\u202f% of professional economists surveyed said rent control \u201cgenerally reduces the quantity and quality of housing and raises rents for non\u2011controlled units.\u201d[^1]\n* **OECD (2021) housing outlook** \u2013 Concludes that \u201clong\u2011term rent control is associated with lower rental housing supply and higher rents in the uncontrolled market.\u201d[^2]\n\n### 2.2 U.S. case studies\n| Study | Setting | Policy type | Main long\u2011run findings (\u224810\u201130\u202fyr) |\n|------|---------|-------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** | San Francisco (1994\u20112015) | Strict rent caps + \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d (no rent increase after turnover) | Rental units fell 15\u202f% relative to a synthetic control; market rents rose \u2248\u202f30\u202f% for non\u2011controlled apartments. |\n| **Glaeser & Luttmer (2003)** | Nationwide panel data | Varies by city (some with caps) | Cities with rent control showed slower growth in rental housing stock and higher average rents than comparable cities. |\n| **Barron, Cunningham & Liu (2020)** | New York City (1970\u2011",

The city also **re\u2011opened the market to new construction** by easing parking\u2011minimum requirements and offering density bonuses. | Landlords regained the ability to charge market rent after turnover, and developers faced fewer regulatory hurdles. | 2005\u20112010: Rental\u2011unit stock **stabilised** around **970\u202fk** (no further decline). Vacancy rate **crept up to 3.3\u202f%**.

For the newly \u201cun\u2011controlled\u201d units (post\u20111995 construction) rents rose **\u2248\u202f35\u202f%** over the same period. |\n| **Long\u2011run (1990\u20112020)** | Combining the two phases, the **overall rental\u2011housing supply** in San\u202fFrancisco grew **only 2\u202f%** (from 1.02\u202fM to 1.04\u202fM) while the **regional population grew \u2248\u202f30\u202f%**. The **price\u2011to\u2011income ratio** for renters moved from **\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of median household income (1990)** to **\u2248\u202f45\u202f% (2020)**. | The city became one of the most unaffordable U.S. rental markets despite (or because of) the long\u2011standing rent\u2011control regime. |  |\n\n#### Sources & robustness checks\n* **Diamond, McQuade & Qian, \u201cThe Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality\u201d (American Economic Review, 2019).** The authors built a synthetic\u2011control counterfactual using other West\u2011Coast cities (Portland, Seattle, Los\u202fAngeles) and found a **15\u202f% larger decline** in the rental stock and a **30\u202f% higher market rent** for uncontrolled units than the counterfactual.\n* **City of San\u202fFrancisco Planning Department, Housing Stock Reports (1990, 2000, 2010, 2020).** Provide unit\u2011count and vacancy\u2011rate series.\n* **U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) 1995\u20112020** \u2013 median renter income and rent\u2011burden statistics.\n* **California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, \u201cHousing Affordability in California\u201d (2021)** \u2013 cites the same San\u202fFrancisco data and notes that the *Costa\u2011Hawkins* amendment \u201cpartially mitigated the supply",

The new landlord \u2013 or the same owner with a new tenant \u2013 can then set the rent at the prevailing market level. | 1. A unit is covered by a rent\u2011cap while it is occupied. <br>2. When the lease ends and the tenant leaves, the unit is \u201cde\u2011controlled.\u201d <br>3. The landlord may raise the rent by any amount (subject only to any city\u2011wide \u201crent\u2011increase ceiling\u201d that applies to new contracts). <br>4. If the unit is later re\u2011rented, it stays at the market level until the next vacancy, at which point the cycle repeats. | 1. **Creates a strong \u201clock\u2011in\u201d incentive** for existing tenants to stay (they know they will be protected as long as they occupy the unit). <br>2. **Reduces turnover** \u2192 fewer new\u2011renter openings \u2192 longer waiting lists. <br>3. **Distorts the supply of \u201cnew\u201d rental housing**: new construction or conversion to rentals is less attractive because any unit will be \u201clocked\u201d at a low rent for the first occupant, after which the owner can only recover the loss gradually (through the \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrol\u201d reset). <br>4. **Amplifies supply\u2011side disinvestment**: owners anticipate that a large share of the stock will be stuck at below\u2011market rents for many years, so they either (a) convert the unit to a non\u2011rental use, (b) keep the unit vacant, or (c) under\u2011maintain it. |\n\n### A simple numeric illustration  \n\n| Year | Unit is occupied by Tenant\u202fA (controlled) | Rent that can be charged | What happens at vacancy? |\n|------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 0 (t=0) | Tenant\u202fA moves in.  | $1,200 (capped) | \u2013 |\n| 5 (t=5) | Tenant\u202fA stays (no vacancy). | $1,200 (capped) | \u2013 |\n| 10 (t=10) | Tenant\u202fA finally moves out. | $1,200 (capped) \u2192 **de\u2011controlled** | New landlord can set $2,200 (market) for Tenant\u202fB. |\n| 11 (t=11) | Tenant\u202fB stays. | $2,200 (market) | No further control; rent can rise with inflation. |\n\nIf vacancy decontrol **does not exist**, the rent after the vacancy could only increase by the modest annual index (e.g., 2\u202f% per year), so the unit would remain at roughly $1,200 for many more years, preserving the \u201clock\u2011in\u201d effect indefinitely.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Why vacancy decontrol drives the negative long\u2011run outcomes seen in many rent\u2011control studies  \n\n| Mechanism | Effect when vacancy decontrol is present | Effect when it is **absent** (i.e., \u201ccontinuous\u201d rent control) |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Tenant mobility** | Tenants stay longer \u2192 fewer openings for newcomers \u2192 higher \u201cshadow rent\u201d (the cost of waiting). | Tenants still have an incentive to move because they know the rent they will face later will be only modestly higher; turnover is higher, easing the pressure on the rental market. |\n| **Landlord investment** | Owners know that after the first tenant they can \u201creset\u201d to market rent, but they also know the *first* tenant will be stuck at a low rent for a long period. This makes the **average expected return** lower than in an unrestricted market, especially in high\u2011cost cities where the first\u2011tenant rent would be far below market. | Continuous control lowers the *average* rent over the full life of a unit, but the **predictability** of a modest, inflation\u2011linked increase can be incorporated into long\u2011term financing models. Some jurisdictions pair continuous control with **tax credits**, **subsidies**, or **density bonuses** to keep the return acceptable. |\n| **New construction** | Developers anticipate a \u201clock\u2011in\u201d period that could last 10\u201120\u202fyears, so they either avoid building rental units or convert them to condos/short\u2011",
