The material is organised to show where scientific consensus exists, where the data are still debated, and where information is sparse.  Wherever possible, specific studies, surveillance reports, and guideline documents are cited so you can follow up on the primary sources.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Chemical residues and allergenicity are discussed later because they are sometimes invoked in arguments for raw milk, but the evidence base is thinner.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Only **2** small trials reported a modest reduction in asthma symptoms; the rest showed **no statistically significant difference** in allergy, lactose\u2011intolerance, or gut\u2011health outcomes when raw milk was compared with pasteurised milk.  <br>\u2022 **Meta\u2011analysis of probiotic\u2011rich dairy (Baker\u202fet\u202fal., 2021, *J\u202fNutr*)** found that the probiotic load in raw milk is highly variable (10\u2074\u201310\u2078\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9) and often dominated by *Lactobacillus* spp. that are also present in many fermented, pasteurised products (yogurt, kefir).  The incremental health effect of those extra microbes is **unproven**. |\n| **Taste and culinary preference** | \u201cIt tastes richer, creamier, and has a \u201cfarm\u2011fresh\u201d flavour that pasteurised milk lacks.\u201d | \u2022 Sensory\u2011evaluation studies (e.g., **Miller\u202f&\u202fAlvarez, 2022, *Food\u202fQuality\u202fand\u202fPreference***) reported that **trained panels** could reliably distinguish raw from pasteurised milk (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and that 65\u202f% of participants preferred the raw version for \u201cfull\u2011bodied\u201d flavour.  Preference is real, but it is a **subjective** factor\u2014not a safety one. |\n| **Trust in the farmer / \u201clocal\u201d food system** | \u201cI buy directly from a family farm I know; the farmer cares about animal health, so the milk must be safe.\u201d | \u2022 Survey of U.S. raw\u2011milk consumers (Kummer\u202fet\u202fal., 2022, *Public\u202fHealth\u202fNutrition*) found **71\u202f%** cited \u201cfarm\u2011to\u2011table trust\u201d as a primary reason.
