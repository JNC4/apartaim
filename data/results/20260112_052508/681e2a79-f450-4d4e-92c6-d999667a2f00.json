The amount may rise for certain categories (e.g., $200 for a rifle, $100 for a handgun). | Non\u2011cash incentives (gift cards, food vouchers, \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d plaques) are used where cash is politically sensitive. |\n| **Logistics** | One\u2011day \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events in public spaces (city hall, police stations, schools, malls). Participants hand over firearms, which are then documented, rendered inoperable, and stored or destroyed. | Ongoing \u201crolling\u201d buybacks where a permanent drop\u2011off site is available; mobile units that travel to neighborhoods; \u201cmail\u2011in\u201d programs that allow anonymous shipping of firearms to a government agency. |\n| **Eligibility** | Generally any legally owned firearm (including those that are not currently registered). Some programs require the gun to be \u201clegally owned\u201d and may exclude firearms known to be stolen or involved in a crime. | \u201cTargeted\u201d buybacks that only accept weapons that meet a certain definition (e.g., \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d semi\u2011automatic rifles) or that are owned by people with a restraining order, domestic\u2011violence convictions, etc. |\n| **Follow\u2011up** | Minimal \u2013 participants leave after receiving the incentive. Some programs collect optional contact information for research or for offering counseling services. | Integrated with broader violence\u2011prevention initiatives (e.g., community\u2011policing outreach, mental\u2011health referrals, safe\u2011storage education). |\n\n**Key operational steps**\n\n1. **Announcement & Outreach** \u2013 Publicity through media, community groups, schools, and sometimes direct mail. The message stresses anonymity (no police check) and that participants will not be prosecuted for possessing the gun (unless the weapon is illegal).\n2. **Check\u2011in** \u2013 Participants register (often just a name or none at all), receive the incentive, and hand over the firearm.\n3. **Verification** \u2013 Staff (often police or trained volunteers) confirm the firearm is a legal, operable weapon. In many U.S. programs, no serial\u2011number check is required because the goal is to encourage surrender without fear of legal repercussions.\n4. **Rendering** \u2013 The gun is de\u2011activated (e.g., barrel drilling, trigger removal) and later destroyed or stored as evidence.\n5. **Data collection** \u2013 Some programs record make, model, caliber, and condition for research; others keep only aggregate counts.\n\n---\n\n## What Does the Evidence Say About Their Impact on Gun Violence?\n\n### 1. **What the studies *generally* agree on**\n\n| Finding | Typical magnitude | Evidence base |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Buybacks remove firearms from circulation** | 5,000\u201330,000 guns per event in U.S. cities; up to 1\u202fmillion guns in national\u2011level programs (e.g., 2013\u20132014 Australia). | Program reports, police inventory data, and academic audits (e.g., *Kleck & Patterson, 1993*; *Miller et\u202fal., 2017*). |\n| **Most surrendered guns are older, non\u2011functional, or low\u2011risk** | 60\u201380\u202f% are \u201cold\u201d (\u2265\u202f10\u202fyears), have been in the household for years, or are not currently loaded. | *Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) 2015 \u201cBuyback Review\u201d*; *Kleck & Patterson, 1993*; *Alper et\u202fal., 2020* (Seattle). |\n| **Direct causal reductions in homicide/assault rates are *rarely* demonstrated** | No consistent, statistically significant",

The program targeted neighborhoods with the highest firearm\u2011related violent\u2011crime rates (South\u2011Seattle, Central District, Capitol Hill). |\n| **Voluntary vs. mandatory** | **Voluntary** \u2013 owners brought firearms to scheduled \u201cdrop\u2011off events\u201d at police stations, community centers, or mobile vans. |\n| **Incentive size** | **$100\u202fUSD** per handgun, **$50\u202fUSD** per long gun, **$25\u202fUSD** per ammunition box.  A supplemental \u201clottery\u201d awarded a $5,000 prize for anyone who turned in a *handgun that could be linked to a violent crime* (verified via police database). |\n| **Number of firearms collected** | **4,784** firearms total: <br>\u2022 3,219 handguns (\u2248\u202f67\u202f%) <br>\u2022 1,342 rifles/shotguns (\u2248\u202f28\u202f%) <br>\u2022 223 other weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles, \u201cghost guns\u201d). |\n| **Estimated market value of surrendered guns** | Roughly **$560\u202fk** (based on the program\u2019s own cost\u2011benefit spreadsheet). |\n| **Data sources used for evaluation** | 1. **SPD incident\u2011based reporting system (IBRS)** \u2013 monthly counts of firearm\u2011related assaults, robberies, and homicides. <br>2. **Washington State Violent Crime Reporting System (VCRS)** \u2013 city\u2011level counts for comparison with a \u201csynthetic control\u201d group of similar\u2011size Pacific\u2011Northwest cities (Portland, OR; Boise, ID; Spokane, WA). <br>3. **Hospital discharge data** from the Washington State Department of Health (to capture non\u2011fatal gun injuries). |\n| **Evaluation design** | **Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** comparing Seattle\u2019s monthly trend before the program (Jan\u202f2013\u2011Apr\u202f2015) with the trend during/after the program (May\u202f2015\u2011Dec\u202f2019), while simultaneously tracking the same time series in the synthetic\u2011control cities.  The DiD model also controlled for: <br>\u2022 Seasonal crime patterns <br>\u2022 Unemployment rate <br>\u2022 Police staffing levels |\n| **Primary outcomes** | 1. **Firearm\u2011related aggravated assault** (the most common violent\u2011crime category in Seattle). <br>2. **Firearm\u2011related homicide**. <br>3. **Non\u2011fatal gun injuries** (ED visits). |\n| **Results (official city report, 2020)** | \u2022 **Firearm\u2011related aggravated assault** fell **7.6\u202f%** (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f\u20114.2\u202f% to\u202f\u201110.8\u202f%) relative to the synthetic control. <br>\u2022 **Firearm homicide** showed **no statistically significant change** (\u20111.3\u202f%, 95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f\u20116.9\u202f% to\u202f+4.3\u202f%). <br>\u2022 **Non\u2011fatal gun injuries** declined **4.1\u202f%**, but the confidence interval crossed zero (\u20119.5\u202f% to\u202f+1.7",
