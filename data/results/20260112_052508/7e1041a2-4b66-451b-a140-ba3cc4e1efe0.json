The evidence is **mixed**; some outcomes show modest benefits, while others show little or no measurable effect on violent crime. I have grouped findings by the type of violence most often examined.\n\n### 1.

The NFA mandated a **mandatory** buy\u2011back of all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic and pump\u2011action shotguns, and all hand\u2011guns with a capacity\u202f>\u202f5\u202frounds. | The program was **nation\u2011wide**, compulsory for the targeted categories, and financed by a one\u2011off $1.5\u202fbillion levy on the public. This scale is rare in the literature and gives the evaluation a relatively \u201cclean\u201d before\u2011and\u2011after signal. |\n| **Implementation** | \u2022 19\u202fmonths (Oct\u202f1996\u202f\u2013\u202fApr\u202f1998) <br>\u2022 650\u202f000 firearms surrendered (\u2248\u202f1\u202f% of all Australian firearms, but \u2248\u202f70\u202f% of the weapons that fell under the NFA) <br>\u2022 Average payout \u2248\u202fAU$\u202f590 per firearm (\u2248\u202fUS$\u202f420 at 1996 exchange rates) | The high participation rate meant that a sizable share of the *high\u2011risk* weapons (hand\u2011guns and high\u2011capacity rifles) were removed from circulation. |\n| **Data source for outcomes** | - **Suicide mortality** from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (complete national death registration) <br>- **Firearm vs. non\u2011firearm suicide** coding based on ICD\u201110 (X72\u2011X74 for firearm, X60\u2011X71 for other methods) <br>- Monthly counts from 1990\u20112002 to allow an interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) analysis | The mortality data are **population\u2011wide, not sample\u2011based**, eliminating concerns about under\u2011reporting that can plague US county\u2011level studies. |\n| **Key findings (Chapman\u202fet\u202fal., 2006; Metzl\u202fet\u202fal., 2015)** | 1. **Firearm suicide rate fell from 1.12 per 100\u202f000 (1995) to 0.88 per 100\u202f000 (1997)** \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f21\u202f% relative reduction** in the two years after the buy\u2011back. <br>2. **Overall suicide rate fell modestly (\u2248\u202f4\u202f% drop)** because non\u2011firearm methods rose slightly, but the net effect remained a reduction. <br>3.

The event created immediate political pressure for stricter gun laws. | The buy\u2011back was part of a **comprehensive reform package**, not an isolated \u201cvoluntary\u201d program.

The majority were semi\u2011automatic rifles (\u2248\u202f12\u202f000) and shotguns (\u2248\u202f9\u202f000). |\n| **Cost** | \u2248\u202fNZ\u202f$78\u202fmillion (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$48\u202fmillion) paid to participants. | Provides a benchmark for cost\u2011effectiveness calculations (see the \u201ccost per life saved\u201d discussion below). |\n| **Data sources for outcomes** | \u2022 **National homicide and suicide statistics** from Statistics New\u202fZealand (monthly counts, ICD\u201110 coding). <br>\u2022 **Firearm\u2011incident database** maintained by the New\u202fZealand Police (includes assaults, robberies, accidental discharges). <br>\u2022 **International Crime Victims Survey** for self\u2011reported victimisation (used in one academic follow\u2011up). | All sources cover the *entire country*, removing the \u201cselection bias\u201d that plagues city\u2011level U.S. studies. |\n| **Key empirical results** | **(a) Firearm homicide** \u2013 2020 (the first full year after the reform) recorded **7 firearm homicides**, down from **13** in 2019 (a 46\u202f% drop).
