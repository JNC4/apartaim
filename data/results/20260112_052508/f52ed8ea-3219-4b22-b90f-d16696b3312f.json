      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the *average* income of a country\u2019s workers, but the gains are unevenly distributed. Some workers\u2014especially those in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011productivity sectors\u2014often see higher wages, more job opportunities and cheaper consumer goods. Others\u2014particularly workers in industries that face import competition from the partner country\u2014may lose jobs or see wages stagnate. The net effect for a given country depends on its economic structure, the terms of the agreement, and the presence of policies that help workers adjust.\n\nBelow is a structured, evidence\u2011based overview that covers:\n\n1. **What the bulk of the research says (the scientific consensus).**  \n2. **The strongest arguments and evidence on the \u201cgood\u201d side.**  \n3. **The strongest arguments and evidence on the \u201cbad\u201d side.**  \n4. **Areas where scholars and policymakers still disagree.**  \n5. **Why the debate is so heated (political, ideological, and methodological reasons).**  \n6. **Key references and where to read more.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Scientific consensus on trade and workers\n\n| Aspect | General consensus among economists (e.g., NBER, IMF, World Bank) |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Overall welfare** | Most studies find that FTAs raise a country\u2019s *real* GDP per\u2011capita by **0.2\u202f%\u20130.6\u202f% per year** of the agreement\u2019s duration (e.g., the *\u201cgravity\u201d* literature). |\n| **Average wages** | On average, workers in signatory countries earn **~0.5\u202f%\u20131\u202f% more** after an FTA, largely because of higher productivity and lower consumer\u2011price inflation. |\n| **Distributional effects** | **Consensus:** the gains are *not* evenly spread. Gains accrue to *export\u2011oriented* sectors, high\u2011skill workers, and capital owners; losses are concentrated among *import\u2011competing* low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Adjustment costs** | The short\u2011run adjustment costs (job loss, wage pressure, regional dislocation) are real and can be sizable, but they can be mitigated with active labor\u2011market policies. |\n| **Net effect** | The *average* net effect on employment is modestly positive (\u22480.1\u202f%\u20130.3\u202f% higher employment rates), but the *distribution* of that effect is the primary source of controversy. |\n\n*Sources:*  \n- *Baldwin, R.

Arguments and evidence that FTAs *help* workers\n\n| Mechanism | Typical outcome for workers | Representative evidence |\n|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Lower consumer prices** | Real wages rise because workers can buy more with the same nominal income. | A 2015 EU\u2011Japan EPA analysis found a **2\u20133\u202f%** reduction in prices for consumer electronics and apparel, translating into a **0.4\u202f%** rise in real wages for the average household. |\n| **Export expansion** | Jobs are created in sectors that gain market access; wages rise where productivity is high. | After NAFTA, U.S. **agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico grew by 30\u202f%** (USDA, 2005), and farm\u2011worker wages in the Midwest rose **\u22485\u202f%** (Gordon & Jovanovic, 2009). |\n| **Technology spillovers** | Firms adopt more efficient processes, raising labor productivity and",

Why Chile is a useful illustration  \n\n| Feature | Why it matters for the trade\u2011jobs question |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Broad, deep FTAs** | Chile signed a *comprehensive* bilateral FTA with the United States in 2004 and later joined the *Pacific\u2011Alliance* (Chile\u2011Mexico\u2011Peru\u2011Colombia) and a *comprehensive* agreement with the European Union (2011).

Those sectors gained *preferential market access* to the United States (zero\u2011tariff quotas for Chilean fruit, wine, salmon, etc.).  \n- **Wage growth** was strongest in those same sectors (average hourly wages rose **\u224810\u202f%** between 2005\u20112010, versus **\u22484\u202f%** in the rest of manufacturing).  \n- The **overall unemployment decline** was modest but statistically significant after controlling for global commodity\u2011price cycles.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
