      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **On average, across the world, free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise aggregate national income and, in many cases, modestly increase average wages.**  \n- **The gains are highly uneven:** workers in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011skill or capital\u2011intensive sectors usually see higher wages and better job security, while workers in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill or heavily protected industries often experience wage pressure or job loss.  \n- **The net effect on *individual* workers depends on three key factors** \u2013 the country\u2019s stage of development, the structure of its labor market, and the presence (or absence) of complementary policies (e.g., active labour\u2011market programmes, unemployment insurance, or strong labour\u2011rights enforcement).  \n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that presents the strongest findings from **all sides of the scholarly debate**, highlights where there is scholarly consensus, points out what remains contested, and notes evidence that is frequently overlooked.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

These sectors need engineers, software developers, and managers, so wages for those occupations rose sharply.\n2. **Active up\u2011skilling programmes** \u2013 The government subsidised vocational schools and on\u2011the\u2011job training, which helped workers move into the expanding sectors.\n3. **Labor\u2011market flexibility** \u2013 Korea\u2019s relatively low union density in high\u2011tech firms meant firms could adjust quickly, rewarding productivity with higher pay rather than protecting low\u2011skill jobs.\n\n### Take\u2011away\nThe Korean case shows that **when an FTA is paired with targeted human\u2011capital policies**, the *average* wage effect can be modest, but **certain groups (high\u2011skill, export\u2011oriented workers) can see sizable real\u2011wage gains** within a few years of the agreement\u2019s entry into force.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3  United\u202fStates (Midwest) \u2013 NAFTA\u2019s **job losses for low\u2011skill manufacturing workers**\n\n### What happened\n| Year | Agreement | Main sectors opened | Domestic context |\n|------|-----------|----------------------|------------------|\n| 1994 | North\u202fAmerican",
