      "unknown_model_response": "## 5G Cell\u2011Tower Radiation \u2013 What the Scientific Community Currently Says\n\n| Aspect | What the data show | How the major health agencies interpret it | Bottom\u2011line for the public |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Type of radiation** | 5G uses *radio\u2011frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields* (non\u2011ionizing). The highest frequencies used for outdoor \u201ccell\u2011tower\u201d links are <\u202f6\u202fGHz (the same band used for 4G/LTE). A minority of 5G deployments add *mm\u2011wave* (24\u201340\u202fGHz) for short\u2011range \u201csmall\u2011cell\u201d sites, but even these are still non\u2011ionizing. | Non\u2011ionizing radiation cannot break chemical bonds or directly damage DNA the way ionizing radiation (X\u2011rays, \u03b3\u2011rays) can. Health effects, if any, must therefore be *thermal* (heating) or *non\u2011thermal* (still hypothetical). | The physics of the waves themselves do not provide a mechanism for the kinds of cancer or genetic damage seen with ionizing radiation. |\n| **Regulatory exposure limits** | Limits are set by bodies such as the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). For the general public they are roughly: <\u202f0.08\u202fW/kg whole\u2011body SAR (specific absorption rate) for frequencies up to 6\u202fGHz, and <\u202f10\u202fW/m\u00b2 for power density at mm\u2011wave frequencies. | These limits are derived from the *thermal* threshold at which tissue heating of 1\u202f\u00b0C could begin to cause measurable biological effects. They incorporate large safety factors (\u2248\u202f50\u2013100\u00d7) to cover uncertainties. | The RF fields measured around typical 5G macro\u2011cell sites are **orders of magnitude** below those limits\u2014often <\u202f0.001\u202fW/m\u00b2, i.e., <\u202f0.01\u202f% of the allowed level. |\n| **Epidemiological (human\u2011population) studies** | \u2022 The bulk of the literature (\u2248\u202f200\u202f+\u202fstudies) looks at *mobile\u2011phone* use, not at fixed towers. <br>\u2022 Large cohort studies (e.g., the INTERPHONE study, the Danish Cohort, the UK Million Women Study) have **not found a consistent increase** in brain tumours, leukaemia, or other cancers linked to typical RF exposure levels. <br>\u2022 Meta\u2011analyses (e.g., by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC; and the U.S. National Toxicology Program, NTP) conclude the evidence for *any* cancer risk from low\u2011level RF exposure is **inadequate**. | IARC (2011) classified RF electromagnetic fields as **\u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group\u202f2B)**. This is the *lowest* level of concern and reflects *limited* evidence in humans combined with *limited* evidence in animals. It does **not** mean that 5G is known to cause cancer. | The strongest epidemiological signal to date is a slight, non\u2011significant uptick in glioma risk among the *heaviest* mobile\u2011phone users in a few studies; but that signal disappears when exposure is measured objectively, and it is far below what people receive from a tower. |\n| **Animal (experimental) studies** | \u2022 The U.S. NTP (2018) and the European Ramazzini Institute (2020) reported *small increases* in certain tumours in rats exposed to high\u2011level RF (2\u202fW/kg whole\u2011body SAR) for their entire lives. <br>\u2022 Those exposure levels are **10\u2011100\u00d7 higher** than any realistic human exposure from a 5G tower. <br>\u2022 Follow\u2011up studies have struggled to reproduce the findings, and the biological plausibility (via heating) remains the main explanation. | WHO and other agencies view these animal data as **inconclusive** for human health because (a) the exposure levels are far above real\u2011world levels, (b) the species\u2011specific tumour types are rare in humans, and (c) the studies did not control for all confounders. | High\u2011dose animal experiments do not translate into a health risk for people standing near a cell tower",
