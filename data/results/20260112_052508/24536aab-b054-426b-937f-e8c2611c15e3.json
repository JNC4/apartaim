Early dose\u2011response studies (1940\u20111970s)** | \u2022 Randomised community trials compared water fluoride concentrations of **0.3, 0.6, 1.0\u202fmg/L** (and higher).<br>\u2022 Caries reduction rose sharply up to about **0.7\u202fmg/L** and then plateaued.<br>\u2022 The prevalence of **mild (questionable) dental fluorosis** began to increase noticeably above **0.7\u202fmg/L**. | Showed a \u201csweet\u2011spot\u201d where added benefit leveled off but the risk of visible fluorosis kept climbing. |\n| **b. Epidemiologic surveys of natural\u2011fluoride waters** | In many countries (e.g., India, China) some municipal supplies have **>\u202f2\u202fmg/L** naturally. Population studies linked those levels to **higher rates of moderate\u2011to\u2011severe fluorosis** without additional caries benefit. | Provided real\u2011world evidence that **excess fluoride adds little extra protection** but raises harms. |\n| **c. Development of the \u201cOptimal Fluoride Level\u201d concept (U.S. Public Health Service, 1962\u20111975)** | The USPHS first recommended **0.7\u20131.2\u202fmg/L** (adjusted for climate). In the 1990s the range was narrowed because: <br>\u2022 **Average water consumption** in the U.S. had risen (more bottled water, higher fluid intake).<br>\u2022 **Fluoride exposure from other sources** (toothpaste, mouth\u2011rinses, processed foods) had increased. | The agency realised that **total daily fluoride intake** was already near the level that produced only **questionable fluorosis** for most people, so a lower water concentration was sufficient. |\n| **d. Quantitative risk\u2011benefit modelling (1990s\u20112000s)** | Using the **Dental Fluorosis Index (TFI)** and caries\u2011prevention data, the USPHS calculated the **fluorosis prevalence** expected at each water\u2011fluoride concentration. The model showed that **0.7\u202fmg/L** would keep **questionable fluorosis <\u202f5\u202f%** of the population while still delivering **\u2248\u202f25\u202f% caries reduction**. | Provided a numeric basis for the final recommendation. |\n| **e. Final USPHS recommendation (2001, reaffirmed 2015)** | **0.7\u202fmg/L** (\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fmg/L) is now the **national optimal level** for the United States. The value is **fixed** (not a range) because the model showed that the \u201csweet\u2011spot\u201d was narrow once modern fluoride exposures were taken into account. | Gives water utilities a single, clear target that balances benefit and risk under current U.S. conditions. |\n\n### 2.\u202fHow the target is translated into a **regulatory guideline**\n\n| Guideline | Value | Legal / advisory status | Who sets it |\n|-----------|-------|------------------------|-------------|\n| **U.S. Public Health Service (USP",
