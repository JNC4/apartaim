The aim is to let you see **what is well\u2011established**, **where uncertainties remain**, and **what the trade\u2011offs are** when you compare the two products.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What \u201csafety\u201d means in this context  \n\n| Aspect | Definition | Why it matters for milk |\n|--------|------------|------------------------|\n| **Microbial contamination** | Presence of viable pathogens that can cause disease (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*, *Brucella*, *Mycobacterium bovis*) | Milk is a nutrient\u2011rich medium; even a few cells can multiply quickly if not killed. |\n| **Chemical/physical hazards** | Residues of antibiotics, pesticides, heavy metals, or physical contaminants (e.g., metal fragments) | These can arise from farm practices, equipment, or environmental exposure. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life & spoilage** | Growth of spoilage organisms that make milk unpalatable or produce toxins (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus* enterotoxin) | Affects both consumer acceptability and the likelihood of ingesting dangerous toxins. |\n| **Consumer\u2011health outcomes** | Documented cases of food\u2011borne illness, hospitalisations, or deaths linked to the product | The ultimate metric for public\u2011health policy. |\n\nPasteurisation (usually **HTST \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs** or **UHT \u2013 135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20115\u202fs**) is designed specifically to **reduce the microbial load** to a level that makes illness *extremely unlikely* when the milk is handled correctly after processing.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
