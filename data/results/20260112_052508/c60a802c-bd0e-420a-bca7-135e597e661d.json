The overall framework \u2013 \u201ccase\u2011by\u2011case\u201d risk assessment\n\nAll major regulatory systems (U.S.\u202fFDA/USDA/US\u202fEPA, European Food Safety Authority\u202f(EFSA), Canada\u2019s CFIA, Japan\u2019s MAFF, China\u2019s NIFDC, etc.) follow the same basic logic that was first codified in the **FAO/WHO \u201cGuidelines for the Conduct of Food Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Plants\u201d (1996)** and updated in 2021.  \n\nThe process is **tiered** and **iterative**:\n\n| Tier | Goal | Typical methods |\n|------|------|-----------------|\n| **Molecular characterisation** | Show what DNA was inserted, where, and whether any unintended changes occurred. | Whole\u2011genome sequencing, PCR, Southern blot, bioinformatic comparison to known genes. |\n| **Compositional analysis** | Verify that the nutrient and anti\u2011nutrient profile is within the normal range for that crop. | Targeted analysis of \u223c80\u2013100 key nutrients, toxins, anti\u2011nutrients, and endogenous metabolites; comparison to a \u201cnon\u2011GM reference variety\u201d and to a historical database (e.g., USDA\u2019s Nutrient Database). |\n| **Allergenicity assessment** | Determine if the new protein could trigger an allergic reaction. | \u2022 **In silico**: sequence homology to known allergens (FAO/WHO 8\u2011mer rule, >35\u202f% identity over 80 aa). <br>\u2022 **In vitro**: serum IgE binding from allergic patients, digestion stability tests (simulated gastric fluid). |\n| **Toxicology** | Look for acute, sub\u2011chronic, or chronic toxic effects. | \u2022 **In vitro** cytotoxicity, genotoxicity (Ames test, micronucleus assay). <br>\u2022 **In vivo**: 90\u2011day rodent feeding studies (often with the whole food, not just the purified protein). |\n| **Nutritional assessment** | Check that the GM food is at least as nutritious as its conventional counterpart. | Same data set used for compositional analysis; sometimes a **diets\u2011based feeding trial** in animals or humans if the GM food is intended to have enhanced nutrition (e.g., Golden Rice, high\u2011oleic soybean). |\n| **Environmental & agronomic assessment** (optional for safety, required for release) | Look for gene flow, weediness, pesticide\u2011resistance spread. | Field trials, pollen dispersal studies, modeling. |\n| **Post\u2011market monitoring** | Detect any unexpected adverse effects after commercialization. | Voluntary or mandatory surveillance, adverse\u2011event reporting systems, epidemiological studies. |\n\nOnly when **all tiers** show no safety concern does the product receive a **\u201cGenerally Recognised As Safe\u201d (GRAS)** or equivalent regulatory clearance.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the data actually show \u2013 the weight of the evidence\n\n### 2.1  Large\u2011scale meta\u2011analyses\n\n| Study | Scope | Main conclusion |\n|------|-------|-----------------|\n| **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) 2016** | 29\u202fyears, >\u202f2,400 peer\u2011reviewed studies covering 27 GM crops | No substantiated evidence of increased health risks; GM crops are as safe as their conventional counterparts. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2020 meta\u2011review** | 12\u202fsystematic reviews, >\u202f400 primary studies | No credible link between approved GM foods and adverse health outcomes. |\n| **International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) 2022** | 200\u202fhuman nutrition studies (including 6 randomized controlled trials) | No significant differences in biomarkers of health (e.g., cholesterol, blood glucose) between GM",

Molecular Characterisation  \n\n| What was done | Main findings |\n|---------------|---------------|\n| **Insertion site mapping** \u2013 Southern blot, PCR, and later whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) | A **single\u2011copy** insert of the **cry1Ab gene** plus a selectable marker (phosphinothricin\u2011acetyltransferase, PAT) located in a non\u2011coding region of chromosome\u202f1. No disruption of endogenous genes. |\n| **Sequence integrity** \u2013 Sanger sequencing of the transgene cassette | The Cry1Ab coding sequence is **identical (100\u202f%)** to the native *Bt* gene proven safe in microbial formulations that have been used in organic agriculture for >\u202f30\u202fyears. |\n| **Stability over generations** \u2013 PCR and WGS on F2\u2013F6 generations | No rearrangements, no loss of the cassette, and no new unintended insertions. |\n| **Bioinformatic analysis** \u2013 Comparison of Cry1Ab and PAT proteins to known toxins, allergens, and human proteins | No \u2265\u202f35\u202f% identity over 80\u202faa to any known allergen; no homology to any toxin or to human proteins. (FAO/WHO 8\u2011mer rule satisfied.) |\n| **Reference:** EFSA (2009) \u201cScientific Opinion on the safety of Cry1Ab protein,\u201d *EFSA Journal* 7(10):1210. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Compositional Analysis  \n\n| Parameter | How it was measured | Outcome |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------|\n| **Macronutrients** (protein, fat, starch, fiber) | AOAC methods on grain harvested from **15 field sites** in the US, Argentina, Spain, and South Africa. | All values fell within the natural variation range of conventional maize hybrids (as defined by the USDA National Nutrient Database). |\n| **Vitamins & minerals** (\u03b2\u2011carotene, thiamine, iron, zinc, etc.) | HPLC and ICP\u2011MS. | No statistically significant differences after correcting for multiple testing. |\n| **Anti\u2011nutrients** (phytic acid, raffinose) | Enzymatic assays. | Within conventional ranges. |\n| **Mycotoxin levels** (fumonisin, aflatoxin) | LC\u2011MS/MS. | Slightly lower fumonisin levels in Bt\u202fMON\u202f810 because of reduced insect damage (a known indirect benefit). |\n| **Reference:** USDA (2010) \u201cComposition of MON\u202f810 maize grain,\u201d *Food Chemistry* 121(2): 447\u2011453. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Allergenicity Assessment  \n\n1. **In\u2011silico screening** \u2013 Cry1Ab and PAT sequences were run through the AllergenOnline database (University of Nebraska) and the WHO/IUIS Allergen database. No hits above the 35\u202f% identity threshold.  \n2. **Serum IgE binding** \u2013 Sera from **30 individuals** with documented maize or insect\u2011protein allergies were tested by ELISA for binding to purified Cry1Ab. **No detectable IgE binding** above background.  \n3. **Digestibility** \u2013 Simulated gastric fluid (pH\u202f1.2, pepsin) assay showed **complete degradation of Cry1Ab within 30\u202fs**, a rate comparable to many known non\u2011allergenic proteins.  \n\n*Conclusion:* No evidence that Cry1Ab or PAT are allergenic.
