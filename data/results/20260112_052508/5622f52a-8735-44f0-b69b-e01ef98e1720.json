Overall consensus\n\n- **Most rigorous evaluations find **little to no measurable reduction in homicide or overall violent crime** that can be directly attributed to buy\u2011backs alone.**  \n- **Some evidence points to modest reductions in **suicide rates** and in the number of firearms circulating in a community, especially when buy\u2011backs are large\u2011scale and sustained.**  \n- **Buy\u2011backs are most effective when paired with broader gun\u2011policy reforms** (e.g., universal background checks, safe\u2011storage laws, and targeted enforcement of illegal\u2011gun trafficking).\n\n> **Bottom line:** Buy\u2011backs alone are not a \u201csilver bullet,\u201d but they can be a useful component of a multi\u2011policy strategy.\n\n### 2.

In a few countries (Australia, New\u202fZealand) the program is run by a national agency. | Some are organized by NGOs or community groups that partner with law\u2011enforcement. |\n| **How are guns collected?** |\u202fVoluntary surrender at designated sites (police stations, schools, community centers).\u202f|\u202fMandatory surrender (e.g., after a court order) is *not* a \u201cbuy\u2011back\u201d \u2013 it is a confiscation. |\n| **Incentive offered?** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or \u201cpoints\u201d that can be exchanged for merchandise. Amounts range from **$5\u2013$200 per firearm**, often higher for \u201crestricted\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles). | Some programs give a flat amount per person, others per weapon, and a few give no money at all (purely symbolic). |\n| **What types of guns are accepted?** | Usually **any** legally owned firearm, sometimes limited to handguns or \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d weapons. | Some programs exclude antique or non\u2011functional firearms, or only accept guns that can be traced. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Turned over to law\u2011enforcement, then **destroyed** (shredded, melted, or otherwise rendered inoperable). | A few jurisdictions sell the metal to recoup costs; a handful keep the weapons for evidence or research. |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events (often tied to a public\u2011safety campaign) or recurring (annual/bi\u2011annual). | In Australia the 1996 program was a single massive sweep; in the U.S., most cities hold occasional \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events. |\n| **Cost** | Direct costs: incentives, staffing, advertising, destruction. Indirect costs: venue rental, data collection. | Some studies include the **opportunity cost** of police time that could be spent on investigations. |\n\n### Core assumptions that programs are built on  \n\n1. **Owners will turn in guns they would otherwise keep** (voluntary surrender).  \n2. **Those guns are the ones most likely to be used in crime, suicide, or accidents**.  \n3. **Removing them from circulation reduces the pool of weapons available for violent use**.  \n\nEach of these assumptions is testable, and the evidence is mixed (see below).\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat the research says \u2013 a systematic overview  \n\nBelow is a **concise \u201cevidence map\u201d** that captures the strongest peer\u2011reviewed studies, government evaluations, and major meta\u2011analyses that have examined the *impact",
