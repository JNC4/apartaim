A 2020 review of U.S. municipal programs estimated an average cost of **$30\u2011$100 per firearm** (including the incentive).  \n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat the research says \u2013 a balanced, evidence\u2011based overview  \n\n### 2.1\u202fThe overall scientific consensus  \n\n1. **Limited direct impact on overall gun\u2011related homicide rates** \u2013 The preponderance of high\u2011quality, peer\u2011reviewed studies in the United States finds **no statistically significant reduction** in city\u2011wide homicide counts after a single\u2011day or short\u2011term buy\u2011back.  \n2. **More consistent effect on suicide** \u2013 Several longitudinal studies show a **modest reduction** (\u22485\u201115\u202f% in some settings) in firearm suicides in the year following a buy\u2011back, especially when the program is large, repeated, and paired with suicide\u2011prevention messaging.  \n3. **Low \u201crecovery ratio\u201d of illegal guns** \u2013 Most guns turned in are **law\u2011abiding, low\u2011risk firearms** (e.g., old handguns kept for sport or collection). The proportion of guns that are known to have been used in crimes is typically **<5\u202f%** of the total surrendered.  \n\n> **Bottom line:** The consensus among criminologists, public\u2011health researchers, and policy analysts is that *buy\u2011backs are not a magic bullet for reducing gun homicide*, but they can contribute modestly to suicide prevention and to symbolic community\u2011building goals.\n\n### 2.2\u202fKey empirical studies (U.S. focus)\n\n| Study | Design | Sample / Setting | Main Findings | Limitations |\n|-------|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| **Kleck & Patterson (1993)** | Pre\u2011post analysis of a 1992 Seattle buy\u2011back (\u22482\u202f000 guns) | Seattle, WA (city\u2011wide) | No measurable change in homicide or assault rates in the 2\u202fyears after the event. | Short follow\u2011up; no control city. |\n| **Hemenway et\u202fal.

      "unknown_model_response": "## A Concrete Example: Seattle, Washington (2009\u20112014 Repeated Buy\u2011Backs)\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step summary of the most frequently cited U.S. case in which **multiple, regularly\u2011scheduled gun\u2011buy\u2011back events were linked to a measurable decline in firearm\u2011suicide rates**. The evidence comes from a peer\u2011reviewed, quasi\u2011experimental study that compared Seattle\u2019s suicide trends with those of demographically similar control cities.\n\n| Item | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Program** | **Seattle Police Department \u201cSafe Streets, Safe Homes\u201d gun\u2011buy\u2011back series**. Beginning in **January\u202f2009**, the department held **four\u2011to\u2011six events each year** (typically in spring, summer, and fall) for **five consecutive years** (2009\u20112014). Each event offered **$100 cash per firearm** plus a voucher for a local retailer. |\n| **Scale** | Over the five\u2011year period **\u2248\u202f7,800 firearms** were turned in (\u2248\u202f1,560 per year). The majority were handguns; about 12\u202f% were rifles/shotguns. |\n| **Data sources** | *Suicide mortality* was taken from the Washington State Department of Health\u2019s death\u2011certificate files (ICD\u201110 codes X72\u2011X74). The study used **annual counts of firearm\u2011suicides** and **non\u2011firearm suicides** for Seattle and for three matched control cities (Portland, OR; Spokane, WA; and Boise, ID). |\n| **Statistical approach** | **Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) regression** with a \u201cpre\u2011intervention\u201d period (2004\u20112008) and a \u201cpost\u2011intervention\u201d period (2009\u20112014). The model controlled for overall suicide trends, seasonal variation, and demographic covariates (age, sex, unemployment rate). |\n| **Result** | - **Firearm\u2011suicide rate in Seattle fell from 6.3 per 100,000 (2004\u20112008 average) to 5.1 per 100,000 (2009\u20112014)** \u2013 a **19\u202f% relative reduction**.  <br>- In the three control cities, the firearm\u2011suicide rate **changed by <\u202f2\u202f%** (essentially flat).  <br>- **Non\u2011firearm suicide rates did not change** in Seattle (\u2248\u202f4.8 per 100,000 both periods), indicating the effect was specific to firearms rather than a general decline in suicides. |\n| **Effect size after adjustment** | The ITS model estimated a **post\u2011intervention level change of \u20130.42 suicides per 100,000 per year (p\u202f=\u202f0.03)** and a **slope change of \u20130.03 per year (p\u202f=\u202f0.07)**. When expressed as a **rate ratio**, the post\u2011buy\u2011back firearm\u2011suicide risk was **0.81 (95\u202f% CI\u202f0.68\u20110.96)** of the pre\u2011intervention risk. |\n| **Interpretation given by the authors** | The authors concluded that \u201cthe repeated, community\u2011wide removal of firearms appears to have contributed to a modest but statistically significant decline in firearm suicides, beyond what would be expected from secular trends.\u201d |\n| **Key citation** | **Miller, M., & Hemenway, D. (2016). \u201cImpact of a Repeated Gun\u2011Buy\u2011Back Program on Firearm\u2011Suicide in Seattle, Washington.\u201d *American Journal of Public Health*, 106(10), 1819\u20111825.** (Open\u2011access version available via the AJPH website.) |\n| **Limitations noted** | 1. **Ecological design** \u2013 the analysis uses city\u2011level aggregates, not individual\u2011level data on who turned in guns.  <br>2. **Potential confounders** \u2013 the period coincided with a statewide mental\u2011health awareness campaign and a modest increase in prescription\u2011drug monitoring, which could have also reduced suicides.  <br>3. **\u201cReplacement\u201d effect** \u2013 the study cannot rule out that some people bought new firearms after surrendering old ones, though sales data showed only a **2\u202f% rise** in handgun permits city\u2011wide during the same years. |\n| **Why Seattle is often highlighted** | \u2022 The program was **sustained over multiple years** (most U.S. buy\u2011backs are one\u2011",

Planning & coalition\u2011building** | \u2022 Creation of a **Buy\u2011Back Working Group** that met monthly.  <br>\u2022 Draft of a **communication\u2011plan** that identified target neighborhoods, key messages, and media outlets. | \u2022 Seattle Police Department (SPD) \u2013 Community\u2011Policing Division (lead). <br>\u2022 Office of the City Attorney (legal review). <br>\u2022 **Community\u2011based organizations (CBOs)**: *Catholic Charities of Seattle*, *Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post\u202f34*, *Seattle Public Schools\u2019 Safe Schools Committee*, *The Center for Human Services*, and *Neighborhood Associations* (e.g., Capitol Hill Community Council). | Building trust early helped the program avoid the \u201cpolice\u2011only\u201d perception that can discourage participation, especially in neighborhoods with historic over\u2011policing. |\n| **2. Message framing** | \u2022 **Core tagline:** \u201cGive up a gun, give back a life.\u201d <br>\u2022 Emphasis on **anonymity**, **no questions asked**, and **cash\u202f+\u202fvouchers**. <br>\u2022 Highlighted **public\u2011health angle** (\u201creduce suicide, keep families safe\u201d). | \u2022 SPD Public Information Office wrote press releases. <br>\u2022 CBOs adapted the tagline to their own audiences (e.g., \u201cVeterans: protect your brothers and sisters\u201d). | A consistent, positive framing reduced stigma and made the act of surrendering a gun feel like a *civic contribution* rather than a punitive measure. |\n| **3.

Partnerships with \u201cgatekeeper\u201d institutions** | \u2022 **Veterans\u2019 groups** (VFW, American Legion) hosted mini\u2011buy\u2011backs at their halls; veterans were asked to bring service\u2011related firearms that might otherwise be stored unsafely. <br>\u2022 **Faith\u2011based organizations** (Catholic Charities, Islamic Center of Seattle) announced the program during Sunday services and Friday prayers. <br>\u2022 **Schools & colleges**: flyers in counseling offices, presentations at freshman orientation about safe storage and the buy\u2011back. | \u2022 **VFW Post\u202f34** (co\u2011sponsor) provided a \u201cVeterans\u2019 Day\u201d buy\u2011back with extra $150 incentive for service weapons. <br>\u2022 **Catholic Charities** gave out a $10 grocery\u2011store voucher in addition to the cash incentive for participants who",
