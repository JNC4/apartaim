The dispenser was not a licensed dairy processing plant; the farm used a bucket milking system and stored milk in a refrigerated bulk tank for up to 48\u202fh before sale. |\n| **Epidemiologic evidence** | \u2022 38/41 case\u2011patients reported drinking the farm\u2019s raw milk within the 7\u2011day exposure window. <br>\u2022 Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates from patients and from a milk sample taken during the investigation showed **\u22642 single\u2011nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** difference, confirming a common source. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | \u2022 The Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services (MDHSS) issued a **temporary suspension of raw\u2011milk sales** at the farm. <br>\u2022 The farm was cited for **lack of a state\u2011approved raw\u2011milk licence**, inadequate sanitation of milking equipment, and insufficient refrigeration (temperature recorded at 7\u202f\u00b0C, above the 4\u202f\u00b0C target for raw milk). |\n| **Public\u2011health impact** | \u2022 41 people fell ill across three counties (average of 1\u20112 cases per day). <br>\u2022 The outbreak prompted a **state\u2011wide media alert** reminding consumers of the risks of raw milk. |\n\n**Why this outbreak matters**\n\n* The **attack rate** among people who drank the milk was very high (\u224890\u202f% of those who reported consumption became ill).  \n* *Campylobacter* is **highly infectious** \u2013 as few as 500 organisms can cause disease.

Heating to 63\u202f\u00b0C\u201372\u202f\u00b0C disrupts these bonds, causing the proteins to unfold (denature) and lose function. | Protein denaturation follows an **Arrhenius\u2011type kinetic curve**: a 10\u202f\u00b0C rise roughly doubles the rate of inactivation (the \u201c10\u2011degree rule\u201d).  Thus a few seconds at 72\u202f\u00b0C are enough to inactivate the bulk of the enzyme pool. |\n| **Membrane damage** | The phospholipid bilayer of bacterial cell membranes becomes more fluid as temperature rises.  Above a certain threshold the membrane loses integrity, leaking cytoplasmic contents and collapsing the proton motive force needed for ATP synthesis. | Gram\u2011negative bacteria (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*) have an outer membrane that is especially heat\u2011sensitive; Gram\u2011positives (e.g., *Listeria*) are a little more robust but still inactivated at HTST conditions. |\n| **Nucleic\u2011acid injury** | Heat can cause depurination and strand breakage in DNA and RNA, especially when combined with the oxidative stress generated by metal\u2011catalyzed reactions in milk (e.g., iron\u2011catalyzed Fenton chemistry). | DNA lesions are irreversible at the short exposure times used; the cell cannot repair them before it dies. |\n| **Loss of ribosomal function** | Ribosomes are large ribonucleoprotein complexes; they denature quickly at >60\u202f\u00b0C, halting protein synthesis. | Without new proteins, even a cell that survives the initial heat burst cannot recover. |\n\n### Quantitative \u201ckill\u2011factor\u201d \u2013 D\u2011values and Z\u2011values  \n\n| Pathogen (typical strain) | **D\u2011value** (time at a given temperature to reduce the population by 1\u202flog\u2081\u2080) | **Z\u2011value** (temperature increase needed to cut the D\u2011value by ten\u2011fold) |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| *Salmonella* spp. (heat\u2011adapted) | D\u2086\u2085\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u202fs (HTST) | Z\u202f\u2248\u202f6\u202f\u00b0C |\n| *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 | D\u2086\u2085\u202f\u2248\u202f1.5\u202fs | Z\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u202f\u00b0C |\n| *Campylobacter jejuni* | D\u2086\u2080\u202f\u2248\u202f0.5\u202fs | Z\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u202f\u00b0C |\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | D\u2086\u2088\u202f\u2248\u202f4\u202fs | Z\u202f\u2248\u202f7\u202f\u00b0C |\n| *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin\u2011producing) | D\u2086\u2088\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202fs (vegetative cells) \u2013 spores: D\u2081\u2081\u2080\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u202fmin | Z\u202f\u2248\u202f6\u202f\u00b0C (vegetative) \u2013 spores need much higher temps |\n\n*Interpretation*: A **high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) delivers roughly a **5\u2011log\u2081\u2080 reduction** (99.999\u202f%) for the vegetative pathogens listed above.
