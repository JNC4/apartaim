      "unknown_model_response": "## Fluoridation of Public\u2011Water Supplies \u2013 What the Science Says  \n\nBelow is a structured overview of the health\u2011related effects that have been documented for the addition of fluoride (usually as sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, or sodium fluorosilicate) to municipal drinking water.  The material is organized by **(1) how fluoride works biologically**, **(2) the benefits that have been observed**, **(3) the potential adverse effects that have been reported**, and **(4) the broader social and ethical context**.  Wherever possible, the most recent systematic reviews, meta\u2011analyses, and major agency reports are referenced so you can see which findings are well\u2011established and which remain debated.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Biological Basis \u2013 How Fluoride Interacts with the Body  \n\n| Aspect | Key points | Typical exposure from fluoridated water |\n|--------|------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Absorption** | Fluoride is absorbed mainly in the stomach and small intestine (\u2248 80\u202f% of ingested dose). | In the U.S., a person drinking water at the recommended 0.7\u202fmg\u202fF/L and consuming ~2\u202fL/day receives ~1.4\u202fmg fluoride/day from water alone. |\n| **Distribution** | Once in the bloodstream, about 50\u202f% binds to calcium in bone, the rest circulates in plasma and is taken up by teeth during formation. | 0.02\u20130.03\u202f% of the absorbed dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 24\u202fh; the rest is retained in bone and teeth. |\n| **Mechanism for dental caries reduction** | \u2022 Fluoride ions replace hydroxide in hydroxyapatite \u2192 fluorapatite, which is more acid\u2011resistant. <br>\u2022 At low concentrations, fluoride promotes remineralisation of early enamel lesions and inhibits bacterial glycolysis (reducing acid production). | The effect is dose\u2011dependent; the \u201coptimal\u201d community\u2011water concentration (0.7\u202fmg/L in the U.S.) is the level that maximises caries reduction while keeping the risk of fluorosis low. |\n| **Metabolism & excretion** | No metabolic transformation; eliminated primarily via kidneys. | Renal clearance is rapid; people with severe chronic kidney disease retain more fluoride, which can modestly raise serum levels. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Documented Health Benefits  \n\n### 2.1 Dental Caries (Tooth Decay)\n\n| Evidence | Summary of Findings |\n|----------|---------------------|\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) \u2013 2021 \u201cCommunity Water Fluoridation\u201d fact sheet** | Shows a **25\u202f% reduction in caries prevalence** among children and adolescents in communities with optimal fluoridation versus non\u2011fluoridated communities. |\n| **Systematic review & meta\u2011analysis (Iheozor\u2011Emma et\u202fal., *Cochrane Database* 2015)** | Included 22 controlled studies (\u2248 1.5\u202fmillion participants). Reported a **relative risk reduction of 30\u202f%** for dental caries in permanent teeth and **37\u202f%** for primary teeth. |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 \u201cFluoride in Drinking\u2011Water\u201d (2021)** | Concludes that **community water fluoridation (CWF) is one of the most cost\u2011effective public\u2011health interventions**: US\u202f$20\u2013$50 per prevented caries lesion, far cheaper than most dental treatments. |\n| **Long\u2011term cohort data (Burt & Eklund, *J Dent Res* 2020, United Kingdom)** | Over 20\u202fyears of follow\u2011up, children in fluoridated areas had **0.5\u20130.8 fewer decayed, missing, or filled surfaces (DMFS)** than those in non\u2011fluoridated areas. |\n\n**Key take\u2011away:** The **preventive effect on dental caries is robust and consistently reproduced** across many countries, age groups, and study designs. The magnitude of benefit is greatest in populations with limited access to dental care or other fluoride sources (e.g., toothpaste).\n\n### 2.2 Indirect/Public\u2011Health Benefits  \n\n* **Reduced need for dental extractions** \u2192 fewer school\u2011absentee days, lower health\u2011",

The numbers are averages (or ranges) across many jurisdictions; individual towns may see slightly larger or smaller effects depending on baseline caries levels, the presence of other fluoride sources, socioeconomic conditions, and how well the fluoridation program is maintained.\n\n---\n\n### 1.
