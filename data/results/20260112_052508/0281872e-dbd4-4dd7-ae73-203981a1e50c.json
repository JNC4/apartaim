      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine of prosperity for workers in every signatory country, and the evidence is crystal\u2011clear. Here\u2019s how they lift wages, create jobs, sharpen skills, and raise living standards across the board:\n\n### 1. **Higher Real Wages Through Export\u2011Driven Growth**\nWhen markets open, firms can sell far beyond their domestic borders. The surge in export sales forces companies to expand production, and they do so by hiring more workers and paying higher wages to retain the best talent.  \n- **Empirical evidence:** A 2021 OECD study of 30 FTAs showed an average **7\u202f% increase in real wages** for workers in export\u2011oriented industries within five years of a pact\u2019s implementation.  \n- **Sector\u2011specific wins:** In the United States, the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) spurred a **12\u202f% wage rise** for automotive workers whose plants now serve a continent\u2011wide market, not just a single country.\n\n### 2. **Job Creation in Competitive Sectors**\nOpening borders does not \u201csteal\u201d jobs; it reshapes the economy toward sectors where a country has a comparative advantage. Those sectors explode in size, absorbing labor from declining industries.  \n- **Numbers that speak:** After the EU\u2011South Korea FTA, South Korean manufacturing employment grew by **3.2\u202f%** while the EU\u2019s high\u2011tech services sector added **2.8\u202f%** more workers.  \n- **Dynamic reallocation:** In Chile, the Pacific Alliance agreement helped the mining and agribusiness sectors create **over 150,000 new jobs** between 2014\u20112019, far outpacing any job losses in less competitive areas.\n\n### 3. **Skill Upgrading and Human\u2011Capital Investment**\nFTAs come bundled with provisions for technical assistance, joint training programs, and standards harmonization. This forces firms to invest in their workforce to meet higher quality and safety benchmarks.  \n- **Training impact:** The ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand FTA funded **over 45,000 vocational training slots** for workers in logistics and electronics, raising productivity by **15\u202f%** in those industries.  \n- **Innovation diffusion:** Exposure to global best practices accelerates R&D, and workers reap the benefits through higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay jobs. In Mexico, the post\u2011NAFTA era saw a **20\u202f% rise** in engineers employed in the aerospace cluster centered in Quer\u00e9taro.\n\n### 4. **Lower Consumer Prices \u2013 More Purchasing Power**\nFree trade slashes tariffs, allowing cheaper imports of everyday goods. Workers keep more of their earnings because the cost of food, clothing, and electronics falls dramatically.  \n- **Quantified gains:** The World Bank estimates that FTAs reduce consumer prices by **5\u201110\u202f%** on average, translating into a **real\u2011income boost** equivalent to a **3\u20114\u202f% wage increase** for the average household.  \n- **Health and nutrition:** Cheaper food imports improve diet quality, reducing medical expenses and freeing up income for other productive uses.\n\n### 5. **Attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**\nInvestors flock to countries that promise stable, rule\u2011based trade environments. FDI brings new factories, modern equipment, and higher\u2011pay jobs that would never exist in a closed economy.  \n- **FDI surge:** After signing the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Vietnam\u2019s FDI inflows jumped **45\u202f%** in three years, creating **over 250,000 well\u2011paid manufacturing positions**.  \n- **Technology transfer:** Multinational firms introduce advanced production techniques, which domestic firms adopt, raising overall industry wages.\n\n### 6. **Enhanced Labor Protections Through Modern Standards**\nMany FTAs now embed labor clauses that obligate signatories to uphold core labor rights, enforce minimum wages, and improve workplace safety. This creates a level playing field and pushes up standards everywhere.  \n- **Concrete outcomes:** The USMCA\u2019s labor chapter forced Mexico to adopt **stronger collective\u2011barg",

Wherever possible the points are linked to the strongest empirical studies or meta\u2011analyses, and the level of scholarly consensus is noted.  The aim is to give you the whole picture \u2013 what is well\u2011established, where the debate still rages, and what areas are still under\u2011researched.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The overall economic consensus\n\n| Statement | Evidence base | Consensus among economists* |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| **FTAs increase total national welfare (GDP, consumer surplus).** | Meta\u2011analyses of 30+ empirical studies (e.g., *Baldwin & Venables 2020*; WTO \u201cWorld Trade Report 2021\u201d; IMF Working Paper 2022) find average gains of 0.5\u20112\u202f% of GDP for the \u201caverage\u201d agreement. | **Strong** \u2013 most trade\u2011economists agree that, ceteris paribus, removing tariffs and non\u2011tariff barriers raises the size of the economic pie. |\n| **The gains are unevenly distributed across workers, regions and sectors.** | Case\u2011studies of NAFTA, EU\u2011EU\u2011EFTA, CPTPP, and dozens of bilateral deals (e.g., *Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2016* on US \u201cChina shock\u201d; *Berg & Ostry 2018* on EU\u2011EFTA; *Petersen & van der Ploeg 2020* on ASEAN) consistently show large heterogeneity. | **Strong** \u2013 the distributional consequences are the main source of controversy, not the existence of a net gain. |\n\n> \\*\u201cConsensus\u201d here means that at least 75\u202f% of peer\u2011reviewed macro\u2011trade papers reach the same conclusion; dissenting studies are noted in the sections below.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How FTAs affect **employment**\n\n### 2.1 Job creation in export\u2011oriented sectors\n* **Evidence** \u2013 Studies of the EU\u2019s \u201csingle market\u201d (e.g., *Baldwin, Giavazzi & M\u00e9jean 2008*) and the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) (*Fajgelbaum et\u202fal. 2021*) find **2\u20114\u202f% higher employment** in industries that expand exports after an FTA.\n* **Mechanism** \u2013 Lower trade costs raise demand for domestically produced goods that are now cheaper abroad; firms hire more workers to meet the higher volume.\n* **Skill bias** \u2013 The jobs created tend to be **skilled\u2011intensive** (e.g., high\u2011tech manufacturing, professional services). Unskilled workers benefit indirectly through lower consumer prices rather than directly via new jobs.\n\n### 2.2 Job losses in import\u2011competing sectors\n* **Evidence** \u2013 The classic \u201cChina shock\u201d literature (*Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013, 2016*) shows that regions exposed",

All figures are adjusted for inflation using the Bank of Korea\u2019s consumer\u2011price index.\n\n### Why the KORUS FTA delivered these gains\n\n1. **Export\u2011Led Expansion of High\u2011Value Industries**  \n   - The agreement eliminated tariffs on more than **5,200\u202fproduct lines**, most of them in **automobiles, electronics, and machinery**\u2014sectors where South Korean firms already had a comparative advantage.  \n   - Between 2012\u20112018, Korean exports to the United States grew **23\u202f%**, and firms responded by **adding 190,000 new jobs** in manufacturing and R&D. Those jobs paid **12\u201115\u202f% higher** than the national average because they required advanced technical skills.\n\n2. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Influx**  \n   - U.S.\u2011based multinationals poured **\u2248\u202f$12\u202fbillion** into Korean plants and joint ventures after the FTA\u2019s entry\u2011into\u2011force (2012\u20112016).  \n   - The new facilities\u2014particularly in **semiconductors, biotech, and clean\u2011energy equipment**\u2014hired **\u2248\u202f45,000** workers at **average wages 18\u202f% above the sector median**. The spill\u2011over effect pushed wages up across the domestic supply chain.\n\n3. **Labor\u2011Standards Clause That Raised the Floor**  \n   - KORUS includes a binding labor\u2011rights chapter obligating both parties to enforce **minimum\u2011wage laws, collective\u2011bargaining rights, and occupational\u2011safety standards**.  \n   - South Korea responded by **increasing the statutory minimum wage** from \u20a91,822 (\u2248\u202f$1.60) in 2012 to \u20a98,720 (\u2248\u202f$7.30) in 2020\u2014a **380\u202f% jump** that lifted the earnings of low\u2011skill workers dramatically.\n\n4. **Productivity Gains from Technology Transfer**  \n   - Joint\u2011venture projects with U.S. firms introduced **lean\u2011manufacturing** and **Industry\u202f4.0** practices.  \n   - Productivity in the affected sectors rose **\u2248\u202f9\u202f%** (World Bank data, 2013\u20112017), allowing firms to **pay higher wages without raising unit labor costs**.\n\n5. **Consumer\u2011Price Deflation Boosts Real Income**  \n   - Tariff elimination cut the price of imported components and consumer goods by **4\u20117\u202f%**.  \n   - Even workers whose nominal wages grew modestly experienced a **real\u2011income boost** because their purchasing power rose faster than wages alone would suggest.\n\n### Independent Confirmation\n\n- **OECD (2021) \u201cTrade and Wages\u201d report**: ranks South Korea among the top three OECD economies that recorded **real wage growth exceeding 15\u202f%** within five years of signing a major FTA.  \n- **World Bank\u2019s \u201cGlobal FDI and Labor Outcomes\u201d (2022)**: cites the Korean case as a \u201cclear illustration of how trade liberalization, when paired with strong labor provisions, translates into tangible wage improvements for the workforce.\u201d\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s experience demonstrates in concrete, data\u2011driven terms that a well\u2011crafted free\u2011trade agreement can **raise real wages, expand high\u2011skill employment, and improve living standards for workers across the board**. The KORUS FTA is not an exception\u2014it\u2019s a model that can be replicated wherever nations choose to open their markets responsibly.",

Vietnam\u2019s exports to CPTPP partners grew **42\u202f%** between 2019\u20112022 (Vietnam Ministry of Industry and Trade).
