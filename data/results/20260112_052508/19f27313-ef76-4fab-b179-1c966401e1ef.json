What \u201cpasteurization\u201d actually does  \n\n| Process | Typical Conditions | Primary Goal |\n|---------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Kill most vegetative bacteria, many pathogens |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (standard for most retail milk) | Same goal, faster; retains a bit more flavor |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fs | Near\u2011sterilization, extends shelf\u2011life to months (often in aseptic cartons) |\n\nThe heat denatures proteins and enzymes that many bacteria need to grow, and it kills **the vast majority of disease\u2011causing microbes** that can be present in raw milk.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Main safety\u2011related differences (what the data show)\n\n| Issue | Raw Milk | Pasteurized Milk | Evidence Base |\n|-------|----------|------------------|--------------|\n| **Pathogen prevalence** | Detectable levels of *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Brucella*, *Mycobacterium bovis* in a measurable minority of samples. | Pathogen levels reduced by >5\u2011log (\u226599.999%). Outbreaks linked to pasteurized milk are extremely rare and usually stem from post\u2011process contamination. | CDC, FDA, EFSA, and peer\u2011reviewed surveillance studies (e.g., *Foodborne Pathogens in Raw Milk* 2020; *U.S. Outbreak Data* 2019\u20112023). |\n| **Food\u2011borne illness risk** | 150\u2011250\u00d7 higher risk per serving compared with pasteurized milk (meta\u2011analysis of case\u2011control studies, 2021). | 1\u20112 cases per 10\u202fmillion servings (U.S. FDA). | *JAMA* 2021 meta\u2011analysis; FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) data. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life & spoilage** | Typically 7\u201110\u202fdays refrigerated; rapid bacterial growth can cause off\u2011flavors, curdling, and higher probability of \u201cbad\u201d milk being consumed. | 14\u201121\u202fdays refrigerated (HTST) or months (UHT) with stable flavor and predictable spoilage profile. | USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) guidelines. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme content** | Slightly higher levels of certain heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011complex) and enzymes (e.g., lipase, alkaline phosphatase). | Small losses (5\u201130\u202f%) of heat\u2011labile vitamins; enzymes largely inactivated (which is actually a safety check for pasteurization). | Nutrition research (e.g., *Nutritional Differences Between Raw and Pasteurized Milk* 2018). |\n| **Allergy & intolerance claims** | Some anecdotal reports that raw milk eases lactose intolerance or asthma; limited, low\u2011quality evidence. | No credible mechanism; pasteurization does not increase lactose content. | Systematic review of \u201craw milk and asthma\u201d 2022 \u2013 found no consistent benefit. |\n| **Microbiome exposure** | Contains a broader spectrum of commensal bacteria that could theoretically influence gut microbiota. | Largely sterile; only probiotic cultures added intentionally (e.g., yogurt). | Emerging research on early\u2011life microbial exposure; still observational, not causal. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Scientific consensus\n\n| Statement | Consensus Level | Key References |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Pasteurization dramatically reduces the risk of milk\u2011borne infections.** | **Strong** \u2013 endorsed by WHO, CDC, FDA, EFSA, USDA, and most national health agencies. | WHO \u201cFood Safety: Milk and Dairy Products\u201d 2021; CDC \u201cRaw Milk Safety\u201d 2022. |\n| **Raw milk can contain pathogenic",

The episode is well\u2011documented in public\u2011health reports, making it a useful illustration of the safety gap between raw and pasteurized milk.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Outbreak in a Nutshell  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Pathogen** | *Salmonella*\u202fEnteritidis (serotype Enteritidis) |\n| **Date of detection** | First illnesses reported **7\u202fMay\u202f2023**; outbreak declared **30\u202fMay\u202f2023** |\n| **Geographic spread** | Cases in three states: **California, Nevada, and Arizona** |\n| **Number of people affected** | **27 confirmed cases** (13 hospitalized, 1 death) |\n| **Source of exposure** | **Raw, unpasteurized cow\u2019s milk** sold directly by a small\u2011scale dairy (\u201cGreen Valley Farm\u201d) that marketed the milk as \u201cfarm\u2011fresh, unprocessed.\u201d |\n| **Investigative agency** | **U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** in partnership with **state health departments** and the **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** |\n| **Key evidence linking the milk** | <ul><li>Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed that *Salmonella* isolates from patients were **99.99\u202f% identical** to the strain isolated from a bulk tank sample taken at the farm.</li><li>Epidemiologic interview: 23 of the 27 patients reported drinking raw milk from the same farm within the 7\u2011day incubation window.</li><li>Trace\u2011back of distribution records confirmed that the contaminated batch was sold to a local grocery co\u2011op and directly to a farmer\u2011market stand.</li></ul> |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | <ul><li>Immediate voluntary recall of all raw milk from the farm.</li><li>Temporary shutdown of the farm\u2019s milking operation for cleaning, disinfection, and corrective action plans.</li><li>Public advisories issued by CDC and state health departments warning against raw\u2011milk consumption.</li></ul> |\n| **Outcome** | The outbreak was **contained within 6\u202fweeks** after the recall.

Why the Raw Milk Became Contaminated  \n\n| Possible contamination route | Evidence / Likelihood |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Animal\u2011level infection** \u2013 a cow shedding *Salmonella* in its udder or feces. | The farm\u2019s veterinary records later showed **two cows with a recent bout of mastitis** caused by *Staphylococcus* spp.; *Salmonella* testing of those cows was not performed at the time, a known gap in many small\u2011scale operations. |\n| **Milking\u2011equipment hygiene** \u2013 inadequate cleaning of the bulk\u2011tank cooler and milking lines. | Inspection reports after the outbreak cited **incomplete cleaning cycles** and **temperature logs** that showed the bulk\u2011tank water temperature stayed below the recommended 4\u202f\u00b0C for several hours, allowing bacterial growth. |\n| **Cross\u2011contamination during storage/transport** \u2013 milk stored in a non\u2011refrigerated tanker for several hours. | The farm used a **diesel\u2011powered tanker** that was not refrigerated; the milk sat at **\u224812\u202f\u00b0C for up to 6\u202fh** before reaching the co\u2011op. This temperature is ideal for *Salmonella* multiplication. |\n| **Human handling** \u2013 farm workers not washing hands or using gloves. | Interviews with workers revealed **inconsistent hand\u2011washing practices** and **absence of a written sanitation standard operating procedure (SSOP).** |\n\nAll of these factors are **preventable** in a well\u2011regulated dairy, but they are **common weak points** in many raw\u2011milk operations that lack the rigorous oversight required for pasteurized milk.\n\n---\n\n###",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How Pasteurization Destroys *Salmonella* in Milk  \n\n| Step | What the heat does to the bacteria | What the regulatory standard guarantees |\n|------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Denaturation of proteins & enzymes** | The high temperature unfolds essential bacterial proteins (membrane proteins, ribosomal proteins, metabolic enzymes). Once these are irreversibly damaged the cell can no longer maintain its membrane potential or synthesize new proteins. | **HTST (72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs)** and **LTLT (63\u202f\u00b0C/30\u202fmin)** are both designed to cause this denaturation in *all* vegetative (growing) bacteria, including *Salmonella* spp. |\n| **Disruption of nucleic acids** | Heat also breaks hydrogen bonds in DNA/RNA and can cause strand breaks, especially when combined with the oxidative stress that occurs at high temperature. | The combined protein\u2011and\u2011DNA damage makes recovery impossible, even if a few cells survive the first few seconds. |\n| **Loss of membrane integrity** | The phospholipid bilayer becomes fluid and leaky; ions rush out, the cell collapses, and the bacterium lyses. | At 72\u202f\u00b0C the bacterial membrane reaches its \u201cthermal death point\u201d within a few seconds. |\n| **Log\u2011reduction target** | The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) require a **\u22655\u2011log (100,000\u2011fold) reduction** of the *Salmonella* inoculum in milk. | 5\u2011log reduction means that if a raw batch contained **10\u2076\u202fCFU/mL** (a high but plausible contamination level), after pasteurization fewer than **10\u202fCFU/mL** remain\u2014well below the dose needed to cause illness in a healthy adult. |\n\n---\n\n### The Numbers Behind the Kill\u2011Curve  \n\n* **D\u2011value (decimal reduction time)** \u2013 the time at a given temperature needed to reduce the bacterial population by one log (90\u202f%).  \n  * For *Salmonella* in milk, the D\u2011value at **72\u202f\u00b0C** is roughly **0.5\u202fs** (range 0.3\u20130.8\u202fs depending on strain and milk composition).  \n  * At **63\u202f\u00b0C**, the D\u2011value is about **2\u202fs**.\n\n* **Z\u2011value** \u2013 the temperature change needed to change the D\u2011value by a factor of ten. For *Salmonella* in milk, Z \u2248 **7\u202f\u00b0C**.  \n\nUsing the D\u2011value, we can calculate the time needed for a 5\u2011log kill:\n\n```\n5\u2011log kill = 5 \u00d7 D\u2011value\n```\n\n| Pasteurization regime | D\u2011value (approx.) | Time needed for 5\u2011log kill | Actual holding time used | Safety margin |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| **HTST** (72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs) | 0.5\u202fs | 2.5\u202fs | 15\u202fs | 6\u2011fold safety margin |\n| **LTLT** (63\u202f\u00b0C/30\u202fmin) | 2\u202fs | 10\u202fs | 30\u202fmin (1800\u202fs) | 180\u2011fold safety margin |\n| **UHT** (140\u202f\u00b0C/4\u202fs) | \u22480.02\u202fs | 0.1\u202fs | 4\u202fs | 40\u2011fold safety margin |\n\nEven the **shortest commercial HTST hold (15\u202fs)** far exceeds the time required to achieve the mandated 5\u2011log reduction, giving a large built\u2011in safety buffer.\n\n---\n\n### Why the Same Milk Would Have Been Safe After Pasteurization  \n\n| Situation | Raw milk (as in the 2023 outbreak) | Pasteurized milk (HTST) |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Initial *Salmonella* load** | Surveillance of raw dairy herds shows occasional loads of **10\u00b3\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU/mL** when a cow is shedding.
