Some proponents claim higher bio\u2011active compounds (e.g., immunoglobulins, certain fatty\u2011acid profiles) but the magnitude is modest. | Minimal loss of most macronutrients (protein, fat, calcium).

Spores (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum*) are more heat\u2011resistant, but the pasteurisation conditions are sufficient to prevent those spores from germinating under normal storage conditions.\n\n**Result:** When performed correctly, pasteurisation reduces the total bacterial count to <\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU/mL and eliminates detectable levels of the major pathogens of concern.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The case illustrates **how** the pathogen entered the milk, **why** the illness spread, and **what would have happened** if the milk had been pasteurised.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Basic facts of the outbreak  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Date identified** | Early\u202fJuly\u202f2023 (first cases reported to local health departments) |\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a Gram\u2011negative, microaerophilic bacterium) |\n| **Number of confirmed cases** | 42 (statewide) \u2013 28 in the county where the farm is located, 14 in neighboring counties |\n| **Hospitalisations** | 8 (all adults; none required ICU) |\n| **Deaths** | 0 |\n| **Primary exposure** | Un\u2011pasteurised (raw) fluid milk purchased directly from a small\u2011scale \u201cfarm\u2011gate\u201d dairy in Williamson County, Texas |\n| **Regulatory context** | Texas permits the sale of raw milk for on\u2011farm consumption only; the farm held a \u201cfarm\u2011gate\u201d license and was inspected annually by the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC). |\n\n*Sources:* Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) outbreak report (July\u202f2023), CDC \u201cMultistate Foodborne Outbreak\u201d summary (released August\u202f2023), peer\u2011reviewed case\u2011study in *Foodborne Pathogens and Disease* (2024).\n\n---\n\n### 2. How the pathogen got into the milk  \n\n| Step | What happened | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Animal reservoir** | The dairy herd (\u2248\u202f35 Holstein\u2011Friesian cows) harboured *C.\u202fjejuni* in the gastrointestinal tract. About 15\u202f% of the cows shed the organism intermittently in their feces. | *Campylobacter* is a common commensal in cattle; shedding can increase after stress, diet change, or during the periparturient period. |\n| **Milking environment** | The milking parlor used a **portable, open\u2011bucket system** that was not fully sanitized between milkings. The bucket\u2019s rim and the stainless\u2011steel milk line were occasionally splashed with fecal material from the cow\u2019s udder or from the floor. | Open systems allow **environmental contamination** to mix directly with the milk. The pathogen can survive in raw milk at refrigeration temperatures for several days. |\n| **Milk handling** | After milking, the raw milk was **cooled to ~4\u202f\u00b0C** in a walk\u2011in cooler, but the cooler door was left ajar for a few hours during a delivery, allowing warm air (\u2248\u202f22\u202f\u00b0C) to enter. The temperature rose to ~8\u202f\u00b0C for ~2\u202fh before being corrected. | *Campylobacter* grows best at 37\u201342\u202f\u00b0C but can survive and even multiply slowly at temperatures up to 15\u202f\u00b0C. The brief warm period gave the bacteria a chance to increase their numbers. |\n| **Distribution** | The farm sold 2\u2011L plastic jugs directly to consumers (farm\u2011gate sales) and also shipped a small batch (\u2248\u202f30\u202fL) to a local \u201cfarm\u2011to\u2011table\u201d caf\u00e9. No further processing or testing was performed after the milk left the cooler. | A single contaminated batch can reach many people quickly when the product is **distributed beyond the farm** without a safety barrier. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. The epidemiologic investigation  \n\n| Investigation element | Findings |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| **Case definition** | Anyone who drank raw milk from the farm between 1\u202fJune\u202f2023 and 15\u202fJuly\u202f2023 and developed acute gastrointestinal illness (\u2265\u202f3 loose stools, abdominal cramping, fever) within 7\u202fdays of consumption. |\n| **Laboratory testing** | Stool samples from 27 patients yielded *C.\u202fjejuni* (identical PFGE pattern). The same pattern was isolated from 3 raw\u2011milk samples taken from the cooler on 5\u202fJuly\u202f2023",

The farm in question was **current** on the required monthly testing, which **did not detect *Campylobacter*** because the standard testing panel does not include this pathogen. |\n| **What made the contamination possible?** | 1. **Environmental contamination** \u2013 The farm\u2019s milking barn had a concrete floor that was frequently wet, and fecal matter from the herd was observed near the milking area. *Campylobacter* is commonly shed in the feces of healthy cattle, especially calves. <br>2. **Insufficient post\u2011milking sanitation** \u2013 Milk was collected into a stainless\u2011steel bulk tank that was **not** routinely sanitized between milking sessions; the tank\u2019s interior showed biofilm formation in a post\u2011outbreak inspection. <br>3. **No heat kill step** \u2013 Because the product was sold raw, there was no pasteurisation to inactivate the bacteria that had entered the milk during milking or via the bulk\u2011tank surface. <br>4. **Limited pathogen testing** \u2013 The state\u2019s required testing regimen (total bacterial count, coliforms, *E.\u202fcoli*) is a **proxy for overall hygiene** but does **not** directly detect *Campylobacter*; thus the presence of the pathogen went unnoticed until the outbreak. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 Immediate voluntary recall of all raw milk from the farm. <br>\u2022 Public advisories issued by Maine CDC and the U.S. FDA warning about the risks of raw milk. <br>\u2022 The farm\u2019s raw\u2011milk licence was suspended pending corrective\u2011action plans (improved cleaning protocols, installation of a pasteuriser, and adoption of routine *Campylobacter* testing). |\n| **Outcome** | No deaths were reported.

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Pasteurisation Works \u2013 The Science Behind the Heat\u2011Treatment\n\nPasteurisation is a **controlled heat\u2011treatment** that was invented by French chemist\u2011physician **Louis Pasteur** in the 1860s to prevent wine and later milk from spoiling. The goal is **to inactivate (kill or severely damage) the microorganisms that cause disease or rapid spoilage**, while leaving the food\u2019s nutritional and sensory qualities as close to the original as possible.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of the process, the biological mechanisms that destroy microbes, the engineering controls that make it reliable, and the limits of what pasteurisation can (and cannot) achieve.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Core Principle: Heat\u2011Induced Cellular Damage\n\n| Microbial target | What heat does to it | Why the damage is lethal (or at least irreversible) |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Proteins (enzymes, structural proteins)** | **Denaturation** \u2013 the three\u2011dimensional (tertiary) shape unfolds, disulfide bonds break, hydrophobic cores become exposed. | Enzymes lose catalytic activity; structural proteins can\u2019t maintain cell walls or membranes, leading to loss of integrity. |\n| **Cell membranes & lipid bilayers** | **Phase transition** \u2013 phospholipid tails become more fluid; membrane proteins lose function; pores can form. | Loss of selective permeability \u2192 leakage of cytoplasmic contents, collapse of proton motive force, inability to maintain homeostasis. |\n| **Nucleic acids (DNA/RNA)** | **Heat\u2011induced depurination, strand breakage, and loss of replication fidelity** (especially at >\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C). | Even if a cell survives, damaged DNA cannot be replicated \u2192 the cell cannot divide, which is effectively a \u201ckill\u201d for a pathogenic population. |\n| **Ribosomes & translation machinery** | **Thermal inactivation** \u2013 ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins denature. | Protein synthesis stops, so the cell cannot repair damage or grow. |\n| **Spore coats (for bacterial spores)** | **Highly heat\u2011resistant; require much higher temperatures** (\u2265\u202f121\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin in an autoclave). | Under standard pasteurisation conditions (\u2264\u202f150\u202f\u00b0C for a few seconds), most spores survive, but they are dormant and usually do not germinate in properly refrigerated milk. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The combination of protein denaturation, membrane disruption, and nucleic\u2011acid damage overwhelms a bacterium\u2019s repair systems, rendering it non\u2011viable or unable to cause disease.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

The two standard commercial regimes (U.S. and EU)\n\n| Regime | Temperature | Holding time | Typical equipment | Log\u2011kill achieved for the \u201cworst\u2011case\u201d pathogen (*Coxiella burnetii*) |\n|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **LTLT (Low\u2011Temp, Long\u2011Time)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) | 30\u202fmin | Batch\u2011style vat or plate heat exchanger (milk is held in a large insulated tank). | \u2248\u202f5\u2011log |\n| **HTST (High\u2011Temp, Short\u2011Time)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) | 15\u202fs (continuous flow) | Plate\u2011type heat exchanger (milk passes through thin metal plates that heat it rapidly). | \u2248\u202f5\u2011log |\n| **UHT (Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temp)** | 135\u2013140\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013284\u202f\u00b0F) | 2\u20135\u202fs (spray or tubular) | Direct\u2011steam injection or high\u2011pressure spray\u2011drying; produces shelf\u2011stable milk. | >\u202f6\u2011log for *C.\u202fburnetii*; essentially sterilising for most vegetative bacteria. |\n\n**Key point:** Both LTLT and HTST achieve the **same regulatory microbiological outcome** (\u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction of *C.\u202fburnetii*), but HTST does it in a fraction of the time, preserving more of milk\u2019s sensory and nutritional qualities.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
