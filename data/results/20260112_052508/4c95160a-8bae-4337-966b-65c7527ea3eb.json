The study examined 224 cases (1970\u20112005) and found that sanctions **succeeded** in 34\u202f% of cases when success was defined as the target **changing the specific behaviour** the sanctioner demanded.  <br>\u2022 **Higher success when:** <br>\u2003\u2013 sanctions are **multilateral** (UN\u2011mandated or at least >3 major powers) \u2192 success 44\u202f% vs. 23\u202f% for unilateral. <br>\u2003\u2013 the target is **economically weak** (low\u2011income or heavily dependent on external trade). <br>\u2003\u2013 there are **clear, credible exit conditions** and a **credible threat of escalation** (e.g., additional sanctions or force). <br>\u2022 **Lower success when:** <br>\u2003\u2013 the target is a **large, diversified economy** (e.g., Russia, China). <br>\u2003\u2013 the political goal is **regime change**; only 1\u20112\u202f% of cases achieve that (e.g., Iraq\u202f1990\u201101, Sudan\u202f1997\u20112003). <br>\u2022 **Recent quantitative work** (e.g., Peksen\u202f2019, *International Organization*; Drezner\u202f2011, *International Studies Review*) confirms the 30\u201140\u202f% range but adds nuance: the **type of demand** matters.

Do sanctions produce the *economic* pressure needed to make a target comply?** | \u2022 **Robust macro\u2011economic impact**: comprehensive sanctions typically cut a target\u2019s **GDP growth by 5\u201115\u202f%** in the first 1\u20112\u202fyears (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.; Pape\u202f1997, *International Security*).

Many measures were **sector\u2011specific** rather than a blanket trade cut\u2011off. | The **targeted nature** hurt the apartheid elite (their overseas assets, access to capital, and ability to sell commodities) while leaving basic food and medicine largely untouched, reducing humanitarian backlash. |\n| **Breadth of participation** | Over 30\u202fcountries participated; by the late\u20111980s the **U.S., EU, Japan, Canada, Australia, and most African states** had joined.  The UN Security Council passed Resolution\u202f418 (arms embargo) and later Resolution\u202f591 (oil embargo). | **Multilateral pressure** eliminated \u201csanction\u2011shopping\u201d \u2013 the regime could not simply shift trade to a single sympathetic state.  The cost per unit of lost export revenue rose dramatically. |\n| **Intensity** | At its peak (mid\u20111980s) sanctions cut South\u2011African export earnings by **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** and foreign direct investment by **\u2248\u202f40\u202f%**.  The South African rand depreciated >\u202f50\u202f% against the dollar, raising inflation and public\u2011sector debt. | The **economic shock** created fiscal crises for the ruling National Party and made the cost of maintaining apartheid higher than the perceived benefits. |\n| **Domestic political context** | \u2022 A strong, organized anti\u2011apartheid movement (e.g., ANC, trade unions, church groups).  <br>\u2022 Massive internal protests, strikes, and a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d (1985\u201186).  <br>\u2022 International NGOs amplified the moral case. | Sanctions **amplified** existing internal pressure.  When the elite saw their personal wealth eroding and the economy spiralling, they became more receptive to elite\u2011led negotiations (the 1990\u201391 \u201creform\u201d talks). |\n| **Policy goal** | *End of institutionalised racial segregation* (the apartheid system). | By 1991 the National Party announced the **unbanning of the ANC**, release of Nelson Mandela, and a negotiated transition to a democratic constitution \u2013 the core political objective of the sanctions. |\n\n### How the literature explains the success  \n\n| Scholarly source | Core argument |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* | The South\u2011African case is the **canonical example of a \u201ctargeted\u2011multilateral\u201d success**: the combination of broad participation, clear\u2011cut economic costs, and a *modest* political aim (change the policy, not necessarily regime removal) gave the sanctions high leverage. |\n| **Murray & Peksen (2020)** \u2013 *When Sanctions Work* | They model the \u201celite\u2011cost\u201d pathway: sanctions raise the *private* cost of maintaining a repressive policy for ruling elites (loss of overseas assets, capital flight).  In South Africa, elite families owned large mining interests that were directly hit. |\n| **Mackenzie (2019)** \u2013 *Sanctions and Domestic Opposition* | The authors stress the \u201c**sanctions\u2011plus\u2011internal\u2011pressure**\u201d synergy.  In South Africa, civil\u2011society mobilised the moral narrative that made the sanctions credible and sustained public support for the government to negotiate. |\n| **Baker & Hufbauer (2022)** \u2013 *Sanctions in the 21st\u202fCentury* | They argue that **targeted financial\u2011asset freezes** (e.g., the \u201cdiamond boycott\u201d and the 1988 \u201ccomprehensive sanctions\u201d on South\u2011African banks) were decisive because they cut off the regime\u2019s ability to finance the security apparatus. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The South\u2011African anti\u2011apartheid sanctions succeeded because they were **multilateral, targeted at the economic interests of the ruling elite, intense enough to create fiscal strain, and timed with",

In parallel, the **EU\u2011Iran Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) sanctions package** (2010\u20112015) was coordinated with the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan. |\n| **Intensity** | By 2014 Iran\u2019s **oil export revenues fell from \u2248\u202f$100\u202fbn to \u2248\u202f$30\u202fbn** (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% drop).
