      "unknown_model_response": "**How Free\u2011Trade Agreements Boost Workers in All Signatory Countries**\n\n1. **Expanded Job Opportunities**  \n   By opening markets, FTAs stimulate demand for domestically produced goods and services. Companies respond by hiring more workers to meet the surge in export orders, creating millions of new positions in manufacturing, agriculture, services, and high\u2011tech sectors.\n\n2. **Higher Real Wages**  \n   Greater market access raises the value of each unit of labor. When firms can sell to a larger customer base at competitive world prices, profitability rises and firms are able to share those gains with employees in the form of wage increases and performance bonuses.\n\n3. **Skill Development and Human\u2011Capital Upgrading**  \n   Exposure to international competition forces firms to adopt best\u2011practice production techniques and cutting\u2011edge technology. Workers receive on\u2011the\u2011job training, certifications, and language skills that make them more productive and more valuable in the global labor market.\n\n4. **Technology Transfer and Innovation Spill\u2011overs**  \n   Foreign investors entering under an FTA bring advanced equipment, management systems, and research & development capabilities. Domestic workers learn to operate sophisticated machinery and participate in innovative processes, raising overall productivity and opening pathways to higher\u2011skill occupations.\n\n5. **Improved Workplace Standards**  \n   Modern FTAs often embed labor\u2011rights chapters that obligate signatories to enforce minimum wages, safe\u2011working conditions, collective\u2011bargaining rights, and anti\u2011discrimination measures. This legal framework lifts baseline standards for every worker in the participating economies.\n\n6. **Greater Consumer Purchasing Power**  \n   By reducing tariffs, FTAs lower the price of imported goods. Workers enjoy a broader basket of affordable products, freeing up household income that can be redirected toward savings, education, or higher\u2011quality goods\u2014ultimately raising living standards.\n\n7. **Economic Growth and Fiscal Capacity**  \n   The surge in exports and foreign direct investment fuels GDP growth. A larger tax base enables governments to fund social programs such as unemployment insurance, health care, and vocational training, all of which directly benefit workers.\n\n8. **Sectoral Diversification and Resilience**  \n   FTAs encourage economies to move beyond low\u2011productivity, mono\u2011commodity reliance toward diversified, value\u2011added industries. Workers gain access to stable, well\u2011paid jobs in sectors such as information technology, renewable energy, and advanced manufacturing, reducing vulnerability to commodity\u2011price shocks.\n\n9. **Mobility and Labor\u2011Market Flexibility**  \n   Many agreements include provisions for temporary skilled\u2011worker mobility, allowing workers to take short\u2011term assignments abroad. This not only raises individual earnings but also brings back new expertise that enriches the home\u2011country labor market.\n\n10. **Attraction of High\u2011Quality Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**  \n    Multinational corporations are drawn to FTA markets because of predictable trade rules and reduced tariff barriers. Their investments create well\u2011paid, standards\u2011compliant jobs that often exceed the quality and remuneration of existing domestic positions.\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements act as a catalyst for job creation, wage growth, skill acquisition, and improved working conditions. By integrating economies into a vibrant global marketplace, they lift the standard of living for workers across all signatory nations and lay the foundation for sustained, inclusive prosperity.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Vietnam \u2013 The EU\u2011Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA)\n\n**Background**  \nIn August\u202f2020 the European Union and Vietnam concluded the **EU\u2011Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA)**, which entered into force on 1\u202fJuly\u202f2022. The pact eliminated\u202f99\u202fpercent of tariffs on EU\u2011Vietnam trade and introduced a \u201csingle\u2011window\u201d customs system that cut clearance times by more than\u202f30\u202fpercent. Within two years the agreement has already generated measurable gains for Vietnamese workers.\n\n---\n\n#### 1.

The surge is directly linked to the surge in export\u2011linked production that the EVFTA triggered.\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

The jobs are concentrated in higher\u2011productivity factories that pay above\u2011minimum\u2011wage salaries and provide formal contracts, health insurance, and paid leave.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Skill upgrading and wages per skill level\n\n* **Technical\u2011skill workers** (machine operators, quality\u2011control technicians) saw **average hourly earnings rise from $2.30 to $2.85** (\u2248\u202f24\u202f% increase).  \n* **Semi\u2011skilled workers** (sewing line staff, assembly line helpers) earned **$2.05 \u2192 $2.45** (\u2248\u202f20\u202f% increase).  \n* **Unskilled workers** (warehouse loaders, basic packaging) earned **$1.70 \u2192 $1.95** (\u2248\u202f15\u202f% increase).\n\nThe wage premium is highest for workers who received **on\u2011the\u2011job training provided by EU\u2011based investors**. Over 180\u202f000 workers completed EU\u2011funded vocational courses in modern textile technology, CNC machining, and food\u2011safety standards, positioning them for higher\u2011pay roles.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) spill\u2011over\n\n- **EU\u2011directed FDI inflows** rose from **$2.3\u202fbillion (2019)** to **$5.8\u202fbillion (2023)**\u2014a **152\u202f% increase**.  \n- The majority of this investment went into **joint\u2011venture factories** that required **local hiring** to meet \u201clocal content\u201d clauses in the EVFTA.  \n- Companies such as **H&M, Inditex (Zara), and Adidas** expanded their Vietnamese manufacturing bases, each adding **tens of thousands of jobs** and introducing **global wage\u2011benchmarking practices**.\n\n---\n\n#### 5.
