This pattern has been replicated in other U.S. cities with similar \u201cstrict\u201d caps (e.g., New\u202fYork City\u2019s rent\u2011stabilization regime before the 2019 \u201cHousing Stability and Tenant Protection Act\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## Policies that can **mitigate** the negative long\u2011term side effects while preserving the protection for current tenants  \n\n| Policy | How it works | Why it helps offset the supply\u2011side drag of rent control | Evidence of effectiveness |\n|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol with \u201crent\u2011reset limits\u201d** (e.g., allow only a *percentage* increase on turnover rather than full market reset) | When a unit becomes vacant the landlord may raise the rent, but only by a capped amount (often tied to inflation + a small premium). | Reduces the incentive to keep units occupied indefinitely, while still limiting abrupt rent spikes for new renters. | **Berliner Senatsverwaltung (2020)** found that Berlin\u2019s \u201cMietpreisbremse\u201d (which caps vacancy\u2011reset increases",

Tenant moves out (voluntary move, lease expiration, eviction for cause, death, etc.)** | \u201cWhen a tenancy terminates, the unit **vacates** the rent\u2011control regime and may be **re\u2011registered** at a **new market rent** subject to a **reset formula**.\u201d | The landlord may file a **\u201creset\u201d** with the local housing authority. The reset usually: <br>\u2022 Uses the **current market rent** for comparable units, **or** <br>\u2022 Applies a **percentage increase** over the previous controlled rent (e.g., 20\u202f% + CPI). <br>\u2022 May be limited to a **maximum** (e.g., no more than 10\u202f% per year). | The next renter faces a **higher base rent** than the previous tenant paid, often close to market rates. |\n| **3.

Optional \u201chard\u201d vacancy decontrol** | Some jurisdictions allow the landlord to **fully deregister** the unit, making it permanently market\u2011rate (no future caps). | The landlord can **keep the unit market\u2011rate forever**; no future rent\u2011control restrictions. | The tenant faces **full market rents** for the entire tenancy, and the unit is no longer protected. |\n\n### Why the rule matters for supply  \n\n1. **Incentive to keep units occupied** \u2013 If a landlord knows that a rent reset will be huge, they may **\u201chold\u201d** the unit (e.g., refuse to renew, or aggressively evict) to keep the low\u2011rent tenant longer. This reduces turnover and can push vacancy rates down.  \n2. **Incentive to convert or sell** \u2013 If the potential profit from a reset or conversion (condo, Airbnb) exceeds the profit from continuing to rent at the controlled rate, landlords may **remove the unit from the rental market**.  \n3. **Policy design lever** \u2013 By **softening** the reset (capping the increase, requiring a modest \u201cinflation\u2011plus\u2011small\u2011premium\u201d increase, or limiting how often a unit can be deregistered), a city can preserve the protective effect for new renters while still giving landlords a modest return.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

As long as that tenant stays in the unit, the rent can **only increase** by a limited amount each year (usually tied to inflation, a CPI index, or a small fixed percentage). | The tenant\u2019s monthly bill is predictable and usually **well below the market price that would be charged for a new tenant**. | This is the \u201caffordability\u201d benefit for incumbents. |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3  De\u2011control on vacancy** | When the tenant **moves out** (or the lease is otherwise terminated), the unit **leaves the rent\u2011control registry**.

The landlord can also **renovate or re\u2011decorate** before re\u2011letting, often recouping costs through the higher rent. | This creates a **price \u201creset\u201d** that can push up average rents for new renters, especially when vacancy rates are low. |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3  \u201cTurnover\u201d as the engine of rent growth** | The **frequency of turnover** (how often units become vacant) determines how quickly the overall rent level in the city drifts upward. | In a tight market, turnover is **infrequent**; each vacancy becomes a \u201cpremium\u201d unit that pulls up the average price. In a more fluid market, turnover is higher, so the \u201cpremium\u201d effect is spread across more units. | The net effect on **housing supply** depends on whether landlords see enough profit incentive to **build new units** or **convert** existing stock (e.g., to condos, short\u2011term rentals). |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3  Administrative side** | Landlords must **register** each controlled unit with a city agency, report rent changes, and often obtain approval for any increase beyond the statutory cap. | This can create **compliance costs** (paperwork, legal fees) that some landlords factor into their profitability calculations. | Higher compliance costs can discourage investment in new rental projects, especially for small\u2011scale landlords. |\n\n### A simple numeric illustration (fictional but realistic)\n\n| Year | Unit status | Controlled rent (annual CPI\u2011adjusted 2\u202f%) | Market rent at vacancy (no cap) | New renter\u2019s rent after vacancy |\n|------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2020 | Tenant A moves in | $1,500/mo (baseline) | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 2022 | Tenant A stays | $1,530/mo (2\u202f% rise) | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 2024 | Tenant A moves out (vacancy) | \u2014 | $2,400/mo (city market) | New renter pays $2,400/mo |\n| 2025 | Tenant B moves in | $2,400/mo (new baseline) | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 2027 | Tenant B stays | $2,448/mo (2\u202f% rise) | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 2029 | Tenant B moves out | \u2014 | $3,200/mo (market has risen) | New renter pays $3,200/mo |\n\n*Result*: **Tenant A** enjoyed a **$900/mo discount** for 4\u202fyears (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% lower than market). **Tenant B**, however, entered at the market price and will see the same discount only if the city later imposes a new rent\u2011control tier.
