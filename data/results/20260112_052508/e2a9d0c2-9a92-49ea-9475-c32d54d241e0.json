What \u201cpasteurisation\u201d actually does  \n\n| Process | Typical parameters (U.S./EU standards) | Main effect |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Kills most vegetative bacteria, including *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*. |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs | Same microbiological kill\u2011rate as LTLT, but with less heat exposure to the milk. |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs | Extends shelf\u2011life (months) by sterilising the product; destroys virtually all microorganisms, including spores. |\n\n**Result:** Pasteurisation reduces the total bacterial load by >5 log\u2081\u2080 (i.e., a 100\u202f000\u2011fold reduction) and eliminates the pathogens most commonly associated with severe food\u2011borne illness.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What \u201craw\u201d milk means  \n\n*Raw milk* is milk that has **not** undergone any heat treatment. It may be filtered to remove debris, but it retains the full complement of microorganisms that were present in the udder, the milking environment, and the storage equipment.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

It is often quoted in European\u2011 and World\u2011Health\u2011Organization (WHO) reports because it illustrates how the **same basic hazards** that appear in the United States also occur in countries with very different dairy\u2011regulatory frameworks.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  **2012 \u2013 \u201cKent, England\u201d *Escherichia\u202fcoli* O157:H7 outbreak linked to raw cow\u2019s milk**\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n|**Date of illness onset**| 19\u202fMay\u202f\u2013\u202f4\u202fJune\u202f2012 (most cases reported within a 10\u2011day window).|\n|**Number of people affected**| **26** laboratory\u2011confirmed cases (all *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7). |\n|**Hospitalisations**| 22 (including 4 patients admitted to intensive\u2011care units). |\n|**Deaths**| 0 (no fatalities, but two patients developed *haemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome* (HUS), a serious kidney complication). |\n|**Pathogen**| *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 \u2013 a Shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing strain that can cause severe gastrointestinal disease and HUS, especially in children and the elderly. |\n|**Source**| Raw, unpasteurised cow\u2019s milk sold directly to the public from a small dairy farm in the village of **Swanley, Kent** (the farm operated a \u201cfarm\u2011shop\u201d and also supplied a local \u201cfarm\u2011share\u201d scheme). |\n|**How investigators linked the illness to raw milk**| 1. **Epidemiologic investigation** \u2013 The UK Health Security Agency (formerly Public Health England, PHE) conducted a **retrospective cohort study** of 126 people who had purchased milk from the farm in the 2\u202fweeks before the outbreak.  The relative risk (RR) of illness for anyone who drank the farm\u2019s raw milk was **RR\u202f=\u202f31.5 (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f=\u202f13.6\u201373.0)**; no cases were identified among the 73 people who bought pasteurised milk or who did not buy milk at all.<br>2. **Laboratory confirmation** \u2013 PFGE and whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) of *E.\u202fcoli* O157 isolates from patients matched **exactly** (\u2264\u202f2 SNP differences) the isolate recovered from a **bulk\u2011tank milk sample** taken on 28\u202fMay\u202f2012 (\u2248\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9). |\n|**Immediate public\u2011health response**| \u2022 **Recall & withdrawal** \u2013 The farm voluntarily recalled all remaining raw milk on 30\u202fMay; the local authority issued a **mandatory product recall** the same day.<br>\u2022 **Public\u2011health alert** \u2013 PHE issued a \u201c**Food\u2011borne Outbreak Alert**\u201d on 31\u202fMay, warning the public to avoid raw milk from the farm and to seek medical care if they had symptoms.<br>\u2022 **Enhanced surveillance** \u2013 The National Health Service (NHS) set up a dedicated telephone line for clinicians to report additional cases; two further cases were identified (both already in the cohort). |\n|**Legal / regulatory outcome**| \u2022 The farm\u2019s licence to sell raw milk was **suspended** under the UK Food Safety Act 1990. <br>\u2022 In the aftermath, the **UK Food Standards Agency (FSA)** published a **\u201cRaw Milk Safety Review\u201d (2013)** that reaffirmed the existing prohibition on the sale of raw milk in **England, Wales and Northern Ireland** (it is legal only in Scotland under strict conditions). The review recommended tighter **mandatory bacterial testing** (\u2265\u202f3\u202fsamples per month) for any raw\u2011milk operation. |\n|**Industry / public\u2011awareness impact**| \u2022 Media coverage (BBC, *The Guardian*, *The Times*) highlighted the \u201c**danger of \u2018farm\u2011fresh\u2019 raw milk**\u201d. <br>\u2022 A **British Nutrition Foundation survey** (2014) showed that the proportion of UK adults who",
