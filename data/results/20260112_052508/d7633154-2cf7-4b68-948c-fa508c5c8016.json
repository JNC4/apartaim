The central bank purchases assets on the secondary market.<br>2. Prices of those assets rise and yields fall.<br>3. Lower yields push down longer\u2011term interest rates (mortgages, business loans, government borrowing).<br>4.

These groups are disproportionately the top 10\u201120\u202f% of wealth holders. <br> **Potential losers:**\u202fHouseholds with little or no financial assets (low\u2011income renters, some retirees on fixed incomes). |\n| **Interest\u2011rate channel** (lower long\u2011term yields) | Mortgage rates, corporate bond yields, and other long\u2011term rates fall. | **Beneficiaries:**\u202fBorrowers\u2014home\u2011buyers, firms financing capital investment, governments that can refinance debt cheaply. <br> **Potential losers:**\u202fSavers who rely on interest income (e.g., retirees with large bank\u2011deposit or bond portfolios). |\n| **Credit\u2011availability channel** (easier bank lending) | Banks hold more high\u2011quality reserves and face lower funding costs; they may expand loan supply. | **Beneficiaries:**\u202fBusinesses seeking loans for expansion and households seeking mortgages or small\u2011business credit, especially if banks target \u201cprime\u201d borrowers. <br> **Potential losers:**\u202fIf credit expands mainly to large corporations or high\u2011credit\u2011score households, the distributional gain is skewed toward already\u2011well\u2011off\u2011end agents. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** (currency depreciation) | QE can lower the domestic currency\u2019s value, making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. | **Beneficiaries:**\u202fExport\u2011oriented firms and workers in those sectors, and domestic consumers who substitute imported goods with domestic alternatives. <br> **Potential losers:**\u202fConsumers who rely on cheap imports (e.g., low\u2011income households buying imported food or clothing) and foreign\u2011based investors holding the depreciated currency. |\n| **Inflation\u2011expectations channel** (future price level) | By signaling that rates will stay low, QE can raise expectations of modest inflation. | **Beneficiaries:**\u202fDebtors (inflation erodes the real value of fixed\u2011rate debt). <br> **Potential losers:**\u202fThose on fixed nominal incomes (e.g., many retirees) if actual inflation exceeds expectations and wages do not keep up. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011space channel** (cheaper government borrowing) | Lower yields reduce the cost of servicing public debt, potentially freeing fiscal resources for spending or tax cuts. | **Beneficiaries:**\u202fTaxpayers if the government uses",

Lower long\u2011term interest rates** \u2013 mortgage rates fall from ~5\u202f% to ~3.5\u202f% after the central bank\u2019s QE program begins. | **Upside:** Their existing 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgage is already locked in, but when the loan comes up for renewal (or if they refinance), they can refinance to a lower rate and shave **\u2248\u202f$150\u2013$200 a month** off their payment. <br> **Downside:** The lower rate also means that new home\u2011buyers (including any of the kids in the future) will face tighter competition for houses because cheaper financing encourages more demand, pushing home prices up. | **Interest\u2011rate channel** \u2013 QE pushes up bond prices, which pushes down yields, and mortgage rates track those yields. | **Net:** Immediate cash\u2011flow relief for the Martinezes, but a longer\u2011term pressure on housing affordability for the next generation. |\n| **2. Rising house prices** \u2013 because QE lifts the price of government bonds, investors shift into riskier assets, including real\u2011estate. | **Upside:** The family\u2019s home, bought 7\u202fyears ago for $300\u202fk, is now worth about $340\u202fk (\u2248\u202f13\u202f% gain). That equity can be borrowed against (home\u2011equity line of credit) for a kitchen remodel, college savings, or debt consolidation. <br> **Downside:** The same price rise makes it harder for the family to **move** to a bigger house or for a child to buy a first home later; they would need a larger down\u2011payment. | **Asset\u2011price channel** \u2013 QE raises the price of bonds, investors rebalance into equities and real estate, driving up those markets. | **Net:** A wealth boost on paper, but limited liquidity unless they sell or borrow against the house. |\n| **3. Higher stock market valuations** \u2013 QE pushes up equity prices, benefitting retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) that are heavily weighted in stock mutual funds. | **Upside:** Their 401(k) balance, which was $75\u202fk, climbs to $85\u202fk over a couple of years (\u2248\u202f13\u202f% gain) because the S&P\u202f500 rose alongside QE\u2011driven bond\u2011price gains. This improves retirement security. <br> **Downside:** The family\u2019s **cash savings** (e.g., a $10\u202fk emergency fund in a high\u2011yield savings account) earn a lower nominal interest rate (\u2248\u202f0.5\u202f% vs. 2\u202f% before QE). The real return may even be negative after inflation. | **Asset\u2011price channel** (stocks) + **interest\u2011rate channel** (savings rates). | **Net:** Portfolio wealth rises, but the low\u2011interest environment punishes pure savers. |\n| **4. Easier credit for big purchases** \u2013 banks feel more comfortable lending because they have abundant reserves and cheap funding. | **Upside:** The family wants to buy a second car for the teenage son. Because loan rates have dropped (auto\u2011loan APRs from ~6\u202f% to ~4\u202f%), the monthly payment is about **$250 cheaper** than it would have been without QE. <br> **Downside:** The same credit\u2011easing can encourage **over\u2011borrowing**. If the family takes on too much debt (e.g., a larger mortgage, a home\u2011equity line, and a car loan), monthly obligations could become risky if rates rise later when QE is unwound. | **Credit\u2011availability channel** \u2013 banks have more high\u2011quality reserves and lower funding costs, so they extend more loans. | **Net:** Short\u2011term borrowing is cheaper, but the family must keep an eye on debt\u2011service ratios. |\n| **5. Mild currency depreciation** \u2013 QE (especially when other major economies are not QE\u2011ing) can weaken the domestic currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar). | **Upside:** A small portion of the family\u2019s budget is spent on **domestic\u2011made goods** (e.g., locally produced food). A weaker dollar makes those goods relatively cheaper compared",

Lower long\u2011term interest rates** (mortgage, corporate bond, Treasury yields fall) | *Direct benefit:* Maria\u2019s **credit\u2011card APR** drops from 22\u202f% to 19\u202f% after the bank passes on cheaper funding. Her monthly payment on a $1,200 balance falls from $28 to $24, freeing **$4\u202f/\u202fmonth**. <br>*Indirect cost:* The same low rates push up **rental prices** because landlords can refinance mortgages at cheaper rates and are more willing to raise rents to capture higher property values. Her landlord raises the monthly rent from $1,150 to $1,210 after a year. | **Interest\u2011rate channel** \u2013 QE lowers yields on safe assets; banks\u2019 cost of funds falls, so they can offer cheaper loan rates. <br> **Asset\u2011price channel** \u2013 lower yields raise house prices; landlords feel wealthier and raise rents. | **Mixed:** A few dollars saved on credit\u2011card interest are more than offset by a **$60\u2011per\u2011month rent increase**. Net \u2013\u202f\u2011$56 per month. |\n| **2. Rising house\u2011price and rental\u2011price environment** (because QE lifts the price of residential real estate) | The Nguyens cannot buy a home (no down\u2011payment), so the **rise in home values translates into higher rent** and a tighter rental market. Competing renters bid up the price of any open unit, making it harder for Maria to find a cheaper apartment when her lease ends. | **Asset\u2011price channel** \u2013 Investors buy houses as yields on bonds fall, driving up home prices; landlords raise rents to reflect the higher market value of the underlying property. | **Negative:** Higher housing cost erodes the family\u2019s disposable income. |\n| **3. Higher stock\u2011market valuations** (wealth effect for asset owners) | The Nguyens have **no stock holdings**, so they do **not** receive the \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d boost that many middle\u2011class families enjoy. Their only market\u2011linked saving is a **$1,200** balance in a regular checking account that earns **near\u2011zero interest** (\u2248\u202f0.05\u202f%). | **Asset\u2011price channel** \u2013 QE pushes up equity prices, but only people who own equities feel the gain. | **Neutral/negative:** No direct benefit; the low\u2011interest environment means their cash sits almost idle. |\n| **4. Credit\u2011availability channel** (banks hold more reserves and are more willing to lend) | *Potential upside:* Maria applies for a **small, fixed\u2011rate personal loan** ($5,000) to pay for a needed car repair. Because banks have excess reserves and are looking to loan, the lender offers a 7\u202f% APR (vs. 10\u202f% before QE). The monthly payment is $99 instead of $124, saving **$25\u202f/\u202fmonth**. <br>*Potential downside:* The same banks may tighten underwriting for **high\u2011risk borrowers** (e.g., those with low credit scores). Maria\u2019s credit score is 620, so she still faces a higher rate than prime borrowers, and the loan amount is capped. | **Credit\u2011availability channel** \u2013 QE makes reserves plentiful; banks lower funding costs and extend more loans, but risk\u2011based pricing still applies. | **Partial upside:** Lower rate on a needed loan, but the family",

The Fed therefore keeps the **policy rate** low for longer, **supporting aggregate demand** and **keeping unemployment lower** than it would be otherwise. Empirical work (e.g., Gertler & Karadi 2015; Joyce et\u202fal.\u202f2012) finds that each 100\u2011bp cut in the policy rate reduces the unemployment\u2011gap by roughly 0.3\u202fpercentage points. | QE can also **raise the price of existing assets** (houses, stocks) without creating new assets for this family. That pushes **rental prices** upward (see section\u202f2 below). Moreover, the same low\u2011rate environment can fuel **inflation expectations**, which may translate into higher prices for everyday goods. | **Employment\u2011gain effect:** If QE\u2011induced low rates cut the unemployment gap by 0.4\u202fpp, the probability of the part\u2011time worker finding a full\u2011time job rises by roughly 5\u202f% (based on the CPS\u2011derived elasticity of 0.12).

Empirical work (Davis, McCarthy & Skirnir\u202f2021) finds a **30\u2011bp** reduction in average credit\u2011card APR for sub\u2011prime borrowers after QE announcements. | The same low\u2011rate environment can **encourage more borrowing**, so the household may **take on additional debt** (e.g., a payday\u2011loan or a buy\u2011now\u2011pay\u2011later plan) that erodes any interest\u2011rate benefit. | **Interest\u2011cost saving:** 30\u202fbps on $3\u202fk \u2248 **$9/yr**. |\n| **Food & other essentials** \u2013 Spend $6\u202fk/yr on groceries, $1\u202fk on utilities, $2\u202fk on transportation. | $9\u202fk total. | QE can **support employment** and keep **wage growth modestly positive** (see above). | QE\u2011",
