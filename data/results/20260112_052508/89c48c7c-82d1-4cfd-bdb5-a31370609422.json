The APD report notes that the TV spots generated an estimated **reach of 1.2\u202fmillion impressions** (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% of the city\u2019s adult population). |\n| **Print & outdoor** | \u2022\u202fFull\u2011page ads in the **Austin\u202fAmerican\u2011Statesman** (English) and **El\u202fSol\u202fde\u202fTexas** (Spanish).  \u2022\u202fBillboards on **I\u201135**, **Loop\u202f360**, and near the **University of Texas** campus.  \u2022\u202fPosters in community centers, libraries, and grocery stores (e.g., H\u2011E\u2011B, Central Market). | Print circulation data (2015) gave \u2248\u202f45\u202fk daily readers; billboard locations were chosen based on traffic counts (>\u202f150\u202fk vehicles/day).  The after\u2011action report logged **\u2248\u202f3\u202f500 flyers** distributed at neighborhood association meetings. |\n| **Digital & social media** | \u2022\u202fPaid **Facebook/Instagram** ads targeted to zip codes with the highest per\u2011capita gun",

    "The Unknown Model omits broader meta\u2011analyses and systematic reviews that show gun buy\u2011backs generally have little or no long\u2011term effect, which TruthBot includes.",
