Always consult a qualified health\u2011care provider before making decisions that could affect your health.\n\n---\n\n## What kinds of microbes are typically found in raw (unpasteurized) milk?\n\nRaw milk is a living, unprocessed product, so it can contain a wide variety of microorganisms that come from the cow\u2019s udder, the surrounding environment, and the milking equipment. The microbial community can be highly variable from farm to farm and even from one batch to the next. Below are some of the groups that are most commonly reported:\n\n| Category | Examples (species/strains) | Typical role in the milk ecosystem |\n|----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Lactic\u2011acid bacteria (LAB)** | *Lactobacillus* spp., *Lactococcus* spp., *Leuconostoc* spp., *Streptococcus thermophilus* | Produce lactic acid, help preserve milk, contribute to flavor. Some strains are used as probiotics in fermented dairy products. |\n| **Bifidobacteria** | *Bifidobacterium breve*, *B. longum* (occasionally) | Commonly associated with gut health; however, they are usually present in much lower numbers in raw milk compared with fermented foods like yogurt. |\n| **Non\u2011pathogenic yeasts & molds** | *Candida* spp., *Geotrichum candidum* | Typically low\u2011level contaminants; can affect flavor if milk is stored too long. |\n| **Environmental/soil bacteria** | *Bacillus* spp., *Pseudomonas* spp. | Often harmless in small amounts but can cause spoilage. |\n| **Potential pathogens** (the \u201crisk\u201d side) | *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Salmonella* spp., *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter* spp. | These can cause food\u2011borne illness, especially in vulnerable populations (young children, pregnant people, elderly, immunocompromised). |\n\n### How many \u201cgood\u201d microbes are actually present?\n\n- **Counts vary wildly.** In a well\u2011managed dairy herd with strict hygiene, the total viable bacterial count in raw milk may be on the order of 10\u2074\u201310\u2075 colony\u2011forming units (CFU) per milliliter, many of which are LAB. In less controlled settings, counts can exceed 10\u2076\u201310\u2077\u202fCFU/mL, and the proportion of harmful bacteria can rise dramatically.\n- **Diversity is limited.** While raw milk does contain live bacteria, the diversity and abundance are far lower than what you\u2019d find in deliberately fermented products (e.g., kefir, yogurt) where specific probiotic strains are added and allowed to proliferate to >10\u2078\u201310\u2079\u202fCFU/mL.\n\n---\n\n## Potential effects on gut health \u2013 what the science says\n\n### 1. **Probiotic\u2011like activity of lactic\u2011acid bacteria**\n- **Mechanism (theory):** LAB can survive the acidic environment of the stomach, reach the intestines, and transiently colonize or interact with the gut microbiota, possibly modulating immune responses or producing short\u2011chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that nourish colon cells.\n- **Evidence level:** **Very limited.** Most human studies on probiotic benefits use *well\u2011characterized* strains delivered in high doses (\u226510\u2079\u202fCFU per serving) and in a format that guarantees viability (e.g",
