      "unknown_model_response": "## Overview  \n\nEconomic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that seeks to change a target country\u2019s **behaviour, policies, or strategic choices** by restricting its access to goods, finance, technology, or markets.  They can be **unilateral** (imposed by one state), **multilateral** (imposed by a coalition such as the United Nations, the European Union, or a group of like\u2011minded states), and they vary in **breadth** (comprehensive vs. targeted) and **intensity** (partial restrictions vs. full embargoes).  \n\nThe question \u201c*how do sanctions typically influence the behaviour or policies of the countries they\u2019re imposed on?*\u201d can be answered at three levels:\n\n1. **Mechanistic pathways** \u2013 the ways sanctions are expected to work.  \n2. **Empirical evidence of outcomes** \u2013 what the data and case studies show.  \n3. **Factors that moderate success or failure** \u2013 why sanctions work in some cases and not in others.\n\nBelow is a balanced, evidence\u2011based synthesis that presents the strongest arguments from both proponents and critics, highlights where scholars agree, and points out the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Mechanistic Pathways \u2013 How Sanctions Are Supposed to Work  \n\n| Pathway | What It Involves | Expected Effect on Target Behaviour |\n|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Economic Cost\u2011Pressure** | Reducing a country\u2019s export revenues, foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI), access to finance, or import of critical inputs (e.g., oil, technology). | Creates a **cost\u2011benefit calculus** for the regime: the \u201cprice\u201d of the undesired policy rises, making a change comparatively cheaper. |\n| **Domestic Political Pressure** | Sanctions can induce inflation, unemployment, shortages, or a decline in living standards, which can erode popular support for the ruling elite. | Generates **internal dissent** (protests, elite defections) that may force policy reversal. |\n| **Signal\u2011Setting / Diplomatic Isolation** | Publicly branding a regime as a pariah, restricting its participation in international institutions, and limiting diplomatic contacts. | Reduces the regime\u2019s **international legitimacy** and may constrain its strategic options (e.g., difficulty obtaining technology or loans). |\n| **Deterrence / Pre\u2011emptive Punishment** | Imposing sanctions early to punish a nascent violation (e.g., nuclear proliferation) and signal that further aggression will be costly. | Aims to **discourage future violations** by raising the expected cost of non\u2011compliance. |\n| **Targeted / Smart Sanctions** | Freezing assets of specific individuals, travel bans, or limiting access to dual\u2011use technology rather than blanket trade bans. | Seeks to **punish decision\u2011makers** while minimising humanitarian harm, thereby increasing political pressure on the leadership. |\n\n*Key theoretical literature*:  \n- **Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott (2007)** \u2013 \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d (the classic \u201csanctions handbook\u201d).  \n- **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 \u201cThe Sanctions Paradox\u201d (why sanctions sometimes fail despite economic pain).  \n- **Pape (1997)** \u2013 \u201cWhy Economic Sanctions Do Not Work\u201d (focuses on domestic political constraints).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical Evidence \u2013 What Has Actually Happened?  \n\n### 2.1 Success Stories (Broad Consensus on \u201cPartial Success\u201d)  \n\n| Case | Sanctions Type | Primary Goal | Outcome (Consensus) |\n|------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| **South Africa (apartheid)** | Multilateral UN & US/EU trade and investment bans (mid\u20111980s) | End racial segregation | **High** \u2013 sanctions contributed to economic pressure and delegitimisation, accelerating negotiations that led to democratic transition (though internal resistance and economic reforms also critical). |\n| **Myanmar (2003\u20112009) \u2013 Targeted Sanctions** | Asset freezes, travel bans on military leaders, export controls on arms | Push for democratic reforms | **Moderate** \u2013 sanctions helped isolate the junta, but the 2007 Saffron Revolution was largely driven by domestic protest; sanctions were lifted after limited concessions. |\n| **Iran (JCPOA\u2011related sanctions, 2006\u20112015)** | Multilateral UN + US/EU secondary sanctions on oil, banking, and dual\u2011use goods | Force nuclear concessions | **Moderate\u2011High** \u2013 sanctions crippled oil revenue, leading Iran to negotiate the 2015",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **detailed case study of a sanction programme that is widely regarded by scholars and practitioners as having failed to achieve its principal political objective** \u2013 the **U.S.\u2013EU sanctions against the regime of **_General\u202fSani\u202fAbacha_** in Nigeria (1995\u20111998)**.  (If you are looking for a more recent example, the entry also notes why the **1990\u20112003 sanctions on Iraq** are often cited as a \u201cpartial\u2011failure\u201d case; the logic of the failure is largely the same.)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Quick Synopsis  \n\n| Element | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Target regime** | Military\u2011led authoritarian government of General\u202fSani\u202fAbacha (Nigeria). |\n| **Sanctioning actors** | United States (primary), European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and a few African states. |\n| **Sanctions imposed** | \u2022 1995: **U.S. Executive Order 12978** \u2013 bans on Nigerian oil exports to the United States, bans on U.S. imports of Nigerian oil, freeze of Nigerian sovereign assets in the U.S.<br>\u2022 1996\u20111998: **EU \u201cOil Embargo\u201d** (no EU member could import Nigerian crude); secondary sanctions on banks that facilitated oil sales; travel bans on senior officials; arms embargo. |\n| **Stated political goal** | Force the Abacha regime to **release political prisoners (most famously journalist\u202fKen\u202fSaro\u2011Wiwa), halt repression, and ultimately restore democratic civilian rule**. |\n| **Outcome (consensus)** | **Sanctions did not compel policy change**.  Abacha remained in power until his sudden death in June\u202f1998, after which a civilian transition began under his successor, General\u202fAbubakar.  The sanctions are therefore judged a **failure** with respect to their primary political aim. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the Sanctions Failed \u2013 A Multi\u2011Layered Explanation  \n\nScholars have identified **five inter\u2011locking reasons** that together explain the failure.  The list is not exhaustive, but it captures the main mechanisms that turned the sanctions from a \u201cpressure\u201d tool into a \u201csymbolic\u201d one.\n\n### 2.1\u202fEconomic Structure\u2011Based Resilience  \n\n| Mechanism | How It Operated in Nigeria |\n|-----------|----------------------------|\n| **Heavy reliance on a single export commodity (oil) that had many alternative buyers** | In the mid\u20111990s, **\u2248\u202f80\u202f% of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings came from crude oil**.  The United States was a major buyer, but **Europe (especially the Netherlands, Italy, Spain) and Asian markets (Japan, South Korea) remained open**.  Even after the EU embargo, the regime found **\u201cthird\u2011party\u201d channels** (e.g., via Singapore\u2011registered vessels) that allowed it to continue shipping oil to Europe and Asia. |\n| **Ability to \u201crebadge\u201d and ship oil through third\u2011party flags** | Nigerian oil was often loaded onto **Pan\u2011African or Middle\u2011Eastern flagged tankers** that were not subject to U.S./EU inspection, allowing the cargo to be sold on the global market despite the embargo. |\n| **Limited impact on government revenue** | Oil revenue fell only **\u2248\u202f15\u202f%** between 1995 and 1998 (from US\u202f$20\u202fbn to US\u202f$17\u202fbn).  The regime could **re\u2011allocate domestic resources**, draw on foreign\u2011exchange reserves, and increase borrowing from friendly banks (e.g., Saudi and Chinese state\u2011linked lenders). |\n\n> **Key source** \u2013 *K.\u202fM.\u202fMiller, \u201cSanctions and the Nigerian Oil Industry, 1995\u20111998,\u201d* *African Affairs* 101 (2002):\u202f125\u2011144.\n\n### 2.2\u202fPolitical\u2011Structure Factors \u2013 Regime Cohesion and Elite Incentives  \n\n| Mechanism | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **A tightly knit military\u2011civic elite whose personal wealth was insulated from sanctions** | The Abacha circle derived **most of its income from oil\u2011related kickbacks, military contracts, and offshore accounts** (e.g., in the British Virgin Islands).  Because the sanctions targeted **state\u2011level oil exports** and **public\u2011sector assets**, they left the **personal fortunes of the ruling clique largely untouched**. |\n| **Absence of",

      "unknown_model_response": "## A Second \u201cSanctions\u2011Failure\u201d Case  \n**Target:** Iraq (1990\u20112003) \u2013 the UN\u2011Security\u2011Council\u2011mandated comprehensive sanctions regime after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait.  \n**Goal of the Sanctions:** Force the Iraqi government under **Saddam\u202fHussein** to **(a)** dismantle its weapons\u2011of\u2011mass\u2011destruction (WMD) programmes, **(b)** comply with UN weapons inspections, and **(c)** withdraw from Kuwait (the latter was achieved militarily in early 1991, but the sanctions were meant to compel the *remaining* political\u2011military demands).  \n\n**Consensus Assessment:**  \n- **Politically:** The sanctions **did not achieve the primary objective** of compelling Iraq to fully disclose and dismantle its WMD programmes.  Saddam remained in power until the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, and the regime continued to hide, develop, and later claim to possess WMDs.  \n- **Humanitarian Impact:** The sanctions caused **massive civilian suffering** (estimates of 300\u202f000\u2013500\u202f000 excess deaths) while failing to change the regime\u2019s behaviour, creating a classic \u201cpain\u2011without\u2011political\u2011payoff\u201d scenario.  \n\nBelow is an in\u2011depth look at **why the sanctions fell short**, organized by the main explanatory strands that scholars, policymakers, and NGOs have identified.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the Sanctions Were Designed & Implemented  \n\n| Aspect | Detail |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Legal basis** | United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR)\u202f661 (1990 \u2013 comprehensive trade embargo) and subsequent resolutions (e.g., 687, 986) that mandated *all* imports/exports except for humanitarian items. |\n| **Scope** | **Comprehensive**: bans on oil exports, imports of food, medicine, spare parts, financial transactions, and most commercial activity. |\n| **Enforcement mechanism** | A **UN\u2011monitoring programme** (UNSCOM, later UNMOVIC) and **regional \u201cNaval Blockade\u201d** (the \u201cOil\u2011for\u2011Food\u201d Committee).  Member states were required to freeze Iraqi assets and deny services to Iraqi entities. |\n| **Humanitarian \u201ccarve\u2011outs\u201d** | Initially minimal; later the **Oil\u2011for\u2011Food Programme (OFFP)** (UNSCR\u202f986, 1995) allowed Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil in exchange for food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods under strict UN supervision. |\n| **Duration** | **13\u202fyears** (Aug\u202f1990\u202f\u2013\u202fMar\u202f2003).  The sanctions were lifted only after the 2003 invasion. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical Findings \u2013 What the Data Show  \n\n| Metric | What Happened | Interpretation |\n|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Oil revenue** | Fell from **\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$30\u202fbn/yr (pre\u20111990)** to **\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$1\u202fbn/yr (1995\u20111996)** under OFFP limits, then rose to **\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$3\u20134\u202fbn/yr** after 1999 when the oil quota was increased. | The regime lost the bulk of its fiscal base, but **still retained enough oil income** (via illicit smuggling and the OFFP) to fund the military and security apparatus. |\n| **Civilian health & nutrition** | UNICEF/WHO estimates: **child mortality rose 50\u202f%\u2013100\u202f%**, widespread malnutrition, shortages of essential medicines; a 1999 UN survey reported **\u2248\u202f1\u202fmillion children under\u20115** were chronically malnourished. | The sanctions **generated severe humanitarian costs** without delivering the intended political leverage. |\n| **Weapons",
