      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** \u2013 the large\u2011scale purchase of government bonds (and sometimes other assets) by a central bank \u2013 is a monetary\u2011policy tool used when short\u2011term interest rates are already near zero.  By injecting reserves into the banking system, QE is intended to lower longer\u2011term interest rates, raise asset prices, and stimulate borrowing and spending.  \nBecause the policy works through the **financial\u2011sector transmission chain**, its effects are not felt uniformly across the population.  Below is a synthesis of the most robust empirical findings, the main theoretical arguments, points of consensus, and the areas where researchers still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How QE works \u2013 the transmission mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Who benefits / who may lose |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Central bank buys safe sovereign bonds \u2192 their price rises, yields fall \u2192 investors shift into riskier assets (corporate bonds, equities, real\u2011estate, commodities). | **Asset owners** (households and firms holding stocks, bonds, housing) see price gains. Those with few or no such assets see little direct benefit. |\n| **Liquidity / credit channel** | Banks receive excess reserves, which can lower the cost of inter\u2011bank funding and encourage lending to firms and households. | Borrowers (businesses, mortgage\u2011seekers, consumers) may obtain cheaper credit. However, the extent of new lending depends on banks\u2019 willingness to lend and borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. |\n| **Expectations channel** | QE signals that the central bank is committed to keeping rates low for an extended period, anchoring inflation expectations and reducing \u201crisk premia.\u201d | All agents may benefit from a more stable macro environment, but the distributional impact depends on who can convert that stability into higher incomes or wealth. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** (especially for open economies) | Lower domestic yields can depreciate the currency, making exports more competitive. | Export\u2011oriented firms and workers in those sectors gain; import\u2011dependent consumers may face higher prices for foreign goods. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011space channel** | Lower yields reduce the government\u2019s cost of borrowing, potentially freeing fiscal resources for redistribution. | The effect is indirect and depends on political choices about how the fiscal \u201csavings\u201d are used. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1. QUICK RECAP  \n*Quantitative easing (QE)* works by **purchasing large amounts of government bonds (and sometimes agency mortgage\u2011backed securities or corporate bonds)**.  \nThe main macro\u2011effects are  \n\n1. **Long\u2011term interest\u2011rate fall** (Treasury yields, mortgage rates, corporate bond spreads).  \n2. **Higher prices for risk\u2011bearing assets** (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate).  \n3. **More bank reserves \u2192 potential for cheaper credit** (if banks choose to lend).  \n\nBecause the transmission channels are **financial\u2011market\u2011centric**, the groups that are already plugged into those markets (home\u2011owners, stock\u2011holders, high\u2011income earners) capture most of the direct gains.  \n\nBelow we examine **how the same policy looks from the perspective of renters, low\u2011income workers, and the broader \u201ceveryday\u2011price\u201d environment**.  The discussion is organized around three questions:\n\n| Question | Core answer (in a sentence) |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n| **A. Do renters see lower housing costs?** | Not directly.  QE lowers *mortgage* rates, not rents, and the modest rise in home prices can even push rents up in tight rental markets. |\n| **B. Does QE lift wages for low\u2011income workers?** | The evidence is mixed; any wage gains are indirect, modest, and often offset by rising living\u2011costs. |\n| **C. Does QE change the price of everyday goods and services?** | QE can raise inflation expectations, but in practice inflation stayed well below target in most QE periods; any price rises were small and uneven across categories. |\n\nLet\u2019s unpack each of these with data, the strongest arguments from the literature, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 2. RENTERS \u2013 WHY QE DOESN\u2019T Directly Lower Their Housing Bill\n\n### 2.1. The \u201cRent\u2011vs\u2011Mortgage\u201d distinction\n\n| Feature | Home\u2011owners (mortgage) | Renters |\n|---------|------------------------|---------|\n| Primary cost driver | **Mortgage interest rate** (directly influenced by QE through MBS purchases). | **Rental market dynamics** \u2013 supply of rental units, local income growth, vacancy rates, and landlord pricing strategies. |\n| QE impact | \u2193 Mortgage rates \u2192 \u2193 monthly payment (if refinancing) and \u2193 cost of new mortgages. | **No direct channel**; rents are set by the private rental market, not by the cost of financing. |\n\n### 2.2. Empirical evidence on rent trends during QE\n\n| Study | Country / QE episode | Main finding on rents |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Kuttner (2018)** \u2013 U.S. QE 2009\u20112014 | United States (Fed) | National median rent rose **\u2248\u202f3\u202f%** from 2009 to 2014, tracking a similar rise in home\u2011price appreciation (\u2248\u202f4\u202f%). |\n| **Borio & Zabai (2020)** \u2013 Euro\u2011area QE 2015\u20112018 | Eurozone (ECB) | Rental price indices in Germany and Spain increased **2\u20114\u202f%** per year, while mortgage\u2011rate\u2011driven housing\u2011cost relief was limited because many households rent. |\n| **Gyourko, Saiz & Summers (2021)** \u2013 UK QE 2009\u20112014 | United Kingdom (Bank of England) | In high\u2011demand cities (London, Manchester) rents grew **5\u20117\u202f%** annually; the authors attribute a portion of the rise to **higher house\u2011price\u2011to\u2011rent ratios** that made landlords more willing to invest in rental units. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** In the periods when QE was active, **rents continued to rise at roughly the same pace as before QE**, sometimes a little faster in regions where house\u2011price inflation was strongest.  The mechanism is indirect:\n\n1. **Higher home prices** raise the *value* of rental properties, encouraging owners to keep units off the market (they can earn higher capital gains by selling later).  \n2. **Lower mortgage rates** make it cheaper for landlords to finance new rental acquisitions, which can increase the supply of rentals *only* after a lag of 1\u20113\u202fyears.  In many cities the supply response was too slow to offset demand, so rents kept climbing.  \n\n### 2.3.
