They adjust for major confounders (age, sex, total energy intake, smoking, alcohol, fiber, BMI, physical activity, etc.). The numbers above are the *average* increase per unit of meat; individual risk can be higher or lower depending on genetics, cooking method, and overall diet.\n\n### Why the numbers look \u201csmall\u201d in absolute terms\n\n- **Relative risk (RR) vs. absolute risk**: A 15\u202f% increase sounds big, but if the baseline probability of disease is low, the absolute increase is modest.  \n- **Population heterogeneity**: In high\u2011incidence regions (e.g., parts of Europe) the absolute number of extra cases per 100\u202f000 can be larger than in low\u2011incidence regions (e.g., parts of sub\u2011Saharan Africa).  \n- **Competing risk factors**: Smoking, low fiber",

Both HCAs and PAHs are mutagenic in animal models and have been linked to human colorectal and pancreatic cancers. |\n| **Fermentation / microbial activity** | Fermented sausages (e.g., salami, chorizo, pepperoni) involve bacteria that convert sugars into acids and also can produce nitrosamines from the added nitrites. | Not a feature of fresh meat; any fermentation occurs only after cooking (e.g., in some home\u2011cured products). | Fermentation can concentrate nitrosamines and other small\u2011molecule carcinogens. |\n| **Added sugars / sweet glazes** | Some processed meats (e.g., \u201choney\u2011glazed ham\u201d, \u201cbarbecue\u2011flavored bacon\u201d) contain added sugars that undergo the **Maillard reaction** during cooking, producing additional HCAs. | Fresh meat may be seasoned with herbs/spices but rarely with large amounts of sugar. | More HCAs \u2192 higher mutagenic load. |\n| **Preservatives & flavour enhancers** (e.g., phosphates, monosodium glutamate) | Common in deli slices, canned meat, meat spreads to improve texture and taste. | Unprocessed cuts seldom contain these additives. | The direct carcinogenicity of these additives is not established, but they can affect gut microbiota and may interact with nitrite chemistry. |\n| **Portion size & frequency** | Processed meats are often eaten as \u201csnacks\u201d (e.g., a few slices of salami) or in fast\u2011food meals, leading to more frequent exposure. | Fresh red meat is usually served as a main course, which many people limit to 1\u20112 times per week. | Higher cumulative exposure \u2192 larger dose\u2011response effect. |\n\n### The **biological mechanisms** that link these factors to cancer\n\n| Mechanism | Evidence (human/animal) | Relevance to processed vs. unprocessed",
