      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to *re\u2011allocate* jobs rather than simply \u201ccreate\u201d or \u201cdestroy\u201d them.  For many workers the net effect is a modest rise in real wages and lower consumer prices, but a sizable minority\u2014especially in industries that were previously protected\u2014can face job loss, wage pressure, or a need to change occupations.  The size and direction of the impact depend on a country\u2019s economic structure, the skill level of its workforce, and the strength of its adjustment policies (e.g., unemployment insurance, retraining programs, labor\u2011rights enforcement).\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the main strands of evidence that scholars and policy\u2011makers rely on when they evaluate FTAs from a labor\u2011market perspective.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the evidence shows \u2013 macro\u2011level outcomes\n\n| Outcome | Typical finding in the empirical literature | Key studies / meta\u2011analyses |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Real wages (overall)** | Small but positive on average (\u22480.5\u20112\u202f% increase) for workers in *export\u2011oriented* or *high\u2011skill* sectors; neutral or slightly negative for low\u2011skill workers in *import\u2011competing* sectors. | \u2022 **Baier & Bergstrand (2007)** \u2013 meta\u2011analysis of 100+ FTAs, finds a 0.5\u20111\u202f% wage boost in partner countries. <br>\u2022 **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)** \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d; analogous mechanisms show modest national\u2011level wage gains after trade liberalisation. |\n| **Employment / job creation** | Net\u2011employment effects are usually close to zero at the national level, but *sectoral* shifts are large: jobs move from protected, low\u2011productivity industries (e.g., textiles, certain manufacturing) to higher\u2011productivity export sectors (e.g., services, high\u2011tech manufacturing). | \u2022 **Baldwin (2016)** \u2013 \u201cThe Great Trade Collapse\u201d notes that FTAs shift jobs rather than change total employment. <br>\u2022 **Motta & de la Feria (2020)** \u2013 case study of NAFTA shows 1\u20132\u202f% of the U.S. labor force moved sectors within a decade. |\n| **Productivity** | Gains of 1\u20113\u202f% in the medium term are common, driven by technology transfer, larger market size, and competition\u2011induced efficiency. Higher productivity can raise wages *if* the gains are shared. | \u2022 **Helpman (2011)** \u2013 \u201cTrade and Labor Market Outcomes\u201d. <br>\u2022 **World Bank (2020) \u201cTrade and Productivity\u201d** \u2013 cross\u2011country regressions show a 0.5\u20111\u202f% productivity rise per 10\u202f% increase in trade intensity. |\n| **Consumer prices** | Lower prices for imported goods (typically 2\u201110\u202f% cheaper) increase real purchasing power, especially for low\u2011income households that spend a larger share on consumption goods. | \u2022 **Bleaney & Greenaway (2005)** \u2013 EU enlargement lowered food and clothing prices by 5\u20117\u202f% for new members. |\n| **Income inequality** | Mixed: FTAs can *reduce* inequality when they expand high\u2011skill, high\u2011pay jobs, but can *increase* inequality if low\u2011skill workers lose jobs and the safety net is weak. | \u2022 **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016)** \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d (trade\u2011induced inequality). <br>\u2022 **OECD (2022) \u201cTrade, Jobs and Inequality\u201d** \u2013 highlights the role of active labour\u2011market policies in mitigating inequality. |\n\n### Take\u2011away\n- **Average effects are modest**; the headline numbers (e.g., \u201cFTAs raise wages by X\u202f%\u201d) hide large heterogeneity across sectors, regions, and skill groups.\n- **Consumer\u2011price benefits are often the most immediate and widely felt** because they affect all households, not just workers in tradable sectors.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The average macro\u2011level impact is small; the *distribution* of gains and losses is the policy\u2011relevant question.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
