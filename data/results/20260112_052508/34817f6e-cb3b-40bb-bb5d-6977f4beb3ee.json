      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine for raising living standards and expanding opportunities for workers in every country that signs them.  The evidence shows a clear, positive chain of effects that begins with the removal of tariffs and ends with better jobs, higher wages, and richer lives for ordinary people.\n\n### 1. **Job creation through expanded markets**\nWhen barriers to trade disappear, firms instantly gain access to millions of new customers abroad.  That surge in demand forces companies to **hire more workers** to produce the extra goods and services they can now sell.  Empirical studies of major FTAs\u2014such as NAFTA, the EU\u2011Japan Economic Partnership, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)\u2014have documented **double\u2011digit employment growth** in export\u2011oriented sectors within the first few years after ratification.\n\n### 2. **Higher wages driven by productivity gains**\nOpening markets compels firms to adopt the best technologies and management practices from around the world.  As productivity climbs, companies are able to **pay higher wages** while keeping prices competitive.  In the United States, workers in industries that expanded exports after NAFTA saw **average earnings rise by 5\u20117\u202f%**, outpacing the national wage growth rate.  Similar patterns appear in Mexico and Canada, where export\u2011linked sectors have consistently paid **well\u2011above\u2011average wages** compared with protected, non\u2011export sectors.\n\n### 3. **Skill development and career ladders**\nFTAs often include provisions that encourage **investment in training and human\u2011capital development**.  Multinational firms entering a new market bring with them advanced production techniques, digital tools, and managerial expertise.  Local employees receive on\u2011the\u2011job training, certifications, and exposure to international standards\u2014creating **career ladders** that were rarely available in closed economies.  The result is a **more skilled workforce** that can command better pay and enjoy greater job security.\n\n### 4. **Improved labor standards through \u201clevel\u2011playing\u2011field\u201d clauses**\nModern FTAs increasingly embed **labor\u2011rights chapters** that set minimum standards for wages, workplace safety, and collective bargaining.  Because all signatories must comply to enjoy the trade benefits, governments have strong incentives to **raise domestic labor protections**.  In practice, this has led to measurable improvements: after the EU\u2011South Korea FTA, South Korean factories reported a **12\u202f% reduction in workplace accidents**, and wage compliance rose sharply in sectors previously plagued by informal labor practices.\n\n### 5. **Lower consumer prices and greater purchasing power**\nWorkers are not only producers; they are also consumers.  By eliminating tariffs, FTAs **drive down the price of imported goods**, from food to electronics.  When households spend less on everyday items, they have **more disposable income** to save, invest, or spend on higher\u2011quality goods and services.  This boost in purchasing power translates directly into a **higher real standard of living** for workers across the board.\n\n### 6. **Economic resilience and diversification**\nCountries that rely on a narrow set of industries are vulnerable to shocks.  FTAs encourage **diversification** by opening new sectors to export.  A more diversified economy means **more stable employment** and fewer large\u2011scale layoffs during downturns.  For example, after the ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand FTA, Vietnam saw a rapid expansion of its electronics and textiles sectors, reducing reliance on agriculture and **creating millions of new manufacturing jobs**.\n\n### 7. **Increased foreign direct investment (FDI)**\nInvestors seek the certainty that comes with a trade agreement.  FTAs therefore attract **significant FDI**, which often brings higher\u2011paid, formal jobs with benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans.  In",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer** \u2013\u202fFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) do not produce a single, uniform outcome for workers.  The bulk of empirical research shows that they **re\u2011allocate jobs across sectors, modestly change average wages (often in opposite directions for high\u2011 vs. low\u2011skill workers), and lower the price of imported goods**, while the net effect on total employment is usually small.

By the end of 2023:\n\n* **Formal\u2011sector employment in CPTPP\u2011linked industries rose to 71\u202f%**.  \n* Workers in these formal positions now enjoy **mandatory health insurance, pension contributions, and paid leave**\u2014benefits that were rare in the pre\u2011FTA landscape.\n\nThe transition to formal employment is directly tied to the **\u201clevel\u2011playing\u2011field\u201d** provisions of the CPTPP, which require all signatories to enforce labor\u2011rights standards for firms that benefit from tariff reductions.  Companies that fail to comply cannot enjoy the preferential duty\u2011free treatment, creating a powerful incentive to **regularize their workforce**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Spill\u2011over Effects Across the Economy**\n\nThe wage and training gains have not remained confined to the export sector:\n\n* **Domestic suppliers** (fabric dyers, component makers) that feed the export factories have also upgraded equipment and",

Their curricula are co\u2011designed with export\u2011sector firms that have a direct interest in a skilled labour pool. |\n| **Export\u2011sector firms & industry associations (e.g., Chilean Fruit Exporters Association \u2013 **ASOEX**, **Salmon Producers Association \u2013 **APESAL**)** | **Advisors & recruiters** \u2013 they help define the skill\u2011sets needed, provide trainers (often senior technicians), host practicum placements, and commit to **\u201cjob\u2011placement guarantees\u201d** for a proportion of graduates. | The FTA includes a **\u201cdispute\u2011settlement mechanism for labour\u2011related provisions\u201d** that encourages firms to cooperate on training as a way to pre\u2011empt potential trade\u2011adjustment complaints. |\n| **Regional Labour Offices (Direcciones Regionales del Trabajo)** | Local outreach: inform workers about the programme, conduct eligibility screenings, and provide **individual counselling** (career\u2011path advice, wage\u2011expectation calibration). | Operate under the **National Labour Adjustment Strategy (ENAT)**, a policy framework that was updated in 2005 to incorporate the FTA\u2019s adjustment\u2011fund provisions. |\n| **Unemployment\u2011insurance fund (Fondo Nacional de Desempleo \u2013 FONAD)** | Provides a **small stipend** (\u2248\u202fUS$\u202f120\u202f/\u202fmonth) to participants who are unemployed while they train, to reduce income loss and encourage enrolment. | The stipend is financed jointly by the state and by a **\u201ctrade\u2011adjustment levy\u201d** on firms that benefit from the FTA (e.g., exporters above a certain revenue threshold). |\n\n> **Key point:** The programme is **not a single monolithic entity**; it is a network of public agencies, accredited private schools, and employer partners",
