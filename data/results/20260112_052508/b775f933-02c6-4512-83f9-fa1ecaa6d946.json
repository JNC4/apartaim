Cutting off those channels created a **sharp fiscal contraction** (GDP fell ~\u202f5\u202f% in 1985\u201186, foreign\u2011exchange reserves fell by half).\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fSignal resolve & credibility  \n\n| Action | Effect on credibility |\n|--------|-----------------------|\n| **U.S. Congress passed the Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act over Reagan\u2019s veto (1986).** | Showed that sanctions would survive a presidential \u201csoft\u2011ball\u201d and could be sustained. |\n| **UN Security Council adopted mandatory arms embargo (Resolution\u202f418) and later an \u201coil embargo\u201d (Resolution\u202f591, 1988).** | Gave the campaign a *legal* backbone\u2014countries that ignored it would face international condemnation. |\n| **Coordinated diplomatic statements** (e.g., the 1988 \u201cCommonwealth \u201cWe\u2019re Not Going to Trade with Apartheid\u201d campaign). | Demonstrated a **united front**, raising the perceived probability that sanctions would stay in place until demands were met. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.\u202fLeverage domestic constituencies  \n\n*In the United States, Europe, and the Commonwealth*:\n\n* **Grass\u2011roots movements** (e.g., \u201cDivest\u2011South\u2011Africa\u201d campaigns) pressured corporations and universities to sell holdings in South African assets.  \n* **Public opinion polls** showed >\u202f70\u202f% support for sanctions in the U.S. by 1986, giving politicians a safe political cover to keep the pressure going.  \n\nThe **domestic political cost** of \u201cbacking down\u201d became high for sanctioning governments, reinforcing the credibility signal.\n\n---\n\n## 5.\u202fMonitor compliance & adjust  \n\n* **U.S",
