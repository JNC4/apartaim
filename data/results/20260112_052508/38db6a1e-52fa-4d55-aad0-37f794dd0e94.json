      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets\u2014usually government bonds and, in later rounds, corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities.**  \nThe goal is to lower the policy interest rate, flatten the yield curve and increase the amount of money that circulates in the financial system.  The way QE \u201cfilters\u201d through the economy creates a set of distributional outcomes that differ across groups.  The evidence is mixed, and the magnitude of each effect depends on the country, the size and timing of the program, and the state of the broader economy.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the main channels and how they tend to affect various groups.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main transmission channels of QE\n\n| Channel | What it does | Typical macro effect |\n|---------|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Interest\u2011rate channel** | Central bank buys bonds \u2192 bond prices rise \u2192 yields fall \u2192 cheaper borrowing for households and firms. | Lower short\u2011 and medium\u2011term rates, reduced mortgage and corporate\u2011loan costs. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011balance (asset\u2011price) channel** | By removing safe assets from the market, investors shift into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate). | Higher prices of equities, housing, and other risk assets; lower risk premia. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | QE lowers the domestic yield relative to foreign yields \u2192 domestic currency tends to depreciate. | Boost to net\u2011exports, cheaper imports for consumers. |\n| **Expectations / inflation\u2011target channel** | Central bank signals commitment to keep rates low until inflation reaches target \u2192 raises inflation expectations. | May raise wages and price levels over time. |\n| **Liquidity / bank\u2011capacity channel** | Direct purchases increase reserves, improve banks\u2019 balance\u2011sheets, and can encourage lending. | More credit available, especially for larger corporates; effect on small\u2011business lending is weaker. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Groups that tend to **benefit** from QE\n\n| Group | How the channels help them | Key empirical findings |\n|-------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Borrowers (households with mortgages, firms with debt)** | Lower loan rates (interest\u2011rate channel) and easier credit conditions. | U.S. studies (e.g., *Joyce, Lasaosa & Song 2011*) show that a 100\u2011bp fall in 10\u2011yr yields reduced mortgage rates by ~30\u201140\u202fbps, increasing home\u2011loan borrowing. |\n| **Young adults / first\u2011time home\u2011buyers** | Cheaper mortgages and higher house\u2011price appreciation raise wealth and purchasing power. | In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s QE rounds (2009\u20112020) were linked to a 5\u20117\u202f% rise in house prices, helping those entering the market but also raising entry\u2011price barriers (see *Mian, Sufi & Verner 2020*). |\n| **Large, export\u2011oriented firms** | Currency depreciation improves competitiveness, and lower financing costs raise investment returns. | Euro\u2011area QE (2015\u20112018) was associated with a 2\u20113\u202f% rise in German export volumes (ECB Working Paper 2019). |\n| **Pension funds and insurance companies** | Higher bond prices improve the value of existing fixed\u2011income holdings; higher equity prices boost funded status. | After the Fed\u2019s QE3 (2012\u20112014), U.S. pension fund assets grew by ~10\u202f% largely through equity gains (Pension Research Council 2016). |\n| **Low\u2011income workers (indirectly)** | By supporting aggregate demand and lowering unemployment, QE can raise wages and job prospects. | Some macro\u2011models (e.g., *Bernanke, Gertler & Gilchrist 1999*) predict a modest \u201cwage\u2011link\u201d effect; U.K. data after 2009\u201110 QE show a 0.2\u2011percentage\u2011point",

Their mortgage\u2011broker offers a 3.25\u202f% fixed\u2011rate loan instead of the 3.55\u202f% they would have gotten a few months earlier. Their monthly payment on a \\$250\u202fk loan falls from \\$1,123 to \\$1,089 (\u2248\u202f3\u202f% savings). | *Joyce, Lasaosa & Song (2011)* find a 100\u2011bp fall in the 10\u2011yr yield cuts mortgage rates by ~30\u201140\u202fbp. |\n| **Month 2\u20114 \u2013 Credit\u2011card / auto\u2011loan costs** | Banks\u2019 cost of funding falls, so they lower rates on unsecured consumer credit. | The family\u2019s credit\u2011card APR drops from 18\u202f% to 16\u202f%. If they carry a \\$5\u202fk balance, they save about \\$80 a year in interest. | U.S. Federal Reserve data show average credit\u2011card APR fell ~0.5\u20111\u202f% after each major QE round (Fed Flow of Funds, 2012\u20112014). |\n| **Month 4\u20116 \u2013 Housing\u2011price boost** | Investors shift from low\u2011yield bonds to real\u2011estate, pushing up house prices (portfolio\u2011balance channel). | The Garcias\u2019 home, bought two years earlier for \\$300\u202fk, is now appraised at \\$330\u202fk\u2014a 10\u202f% gain. Their net\u2011worth (home equity) rises, making it easier to refinance or tap home\u2011equity for a renovation. | In the U.K., QE rounds 2009\u20112020 were linked to a 5\u20117\u202f% cumulative rise in house prices (Bank of England, 2021). |\n| **Month 6\u20119 \u2013 Savings\u2011interest squeeze** | The same low\u2011rate environment reduces the interest paid on deposits and short\u2011term savings accounts. | Their high\u2011yield savings account that paid 1.5\u202f% drops to 0.9\u202f%. On a \\$20\u202fk emergency fund, they lose about \\$120 of interest per year. | Deposit\u2011rate spreads fell by ~0.4\u202f% after each QE round (Federal Reserve, \u201cInterest on Reserves\u201d data). |\n| **Month 8\u201112 \u2013 Stock\u2011market uplift** | Higher equity valuations from the portfolio\u2011balance channel raise the value of retirement accounts. | The couple\u2019s 401(k) is invested 60\u202f% in equities.

Mortgage borrowing \u2013 cheaper debt service  \n\n| Event | What actually changes | How the household feels it |\n|-------|----------------------|----------------------------|\n| The Fed buys $1.5\u202ftrillion of Treasury and agency\u2011MBS each month (QE1\u2011QE3). | The supply of safe assets rises, pushing *yields* on 10\u2011year Treasuries from ~4\u202f% (2008) to ~2\u202f% (2013). Mortgage rates, which track Treasury yields, fall from ~5.5\u202f% to ~3.5\u202f%. | The family decides to refinance their 30\u2011year mortgage of $250\u202fk.

That extra cash can be used for a car repair, a modest vacation, or added to a savings buffer. |\n| **Evidence** | *Federal Reserve Bank of St.\u202fLouis* (2009\u20112014) found a 100\u2011basis\u2011point fall in the policy rate reduced average mortgage rates by about 70\u202fbps. *Auerbach & Gorodnichenko (2012)* estimated that QE lowered the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield by ~1.5\u202f% points. |  |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** For **home\u2011owners with variable\u2011rate or refinance\u2011able mortgages**, QE directly reduces the cost of servicing debt, increasing disposable income.

However, if they *rent* a new apartment (e.g., after a job move), the monthly rent they would have to pay is **\u2248\u202f$1,200**, up from $1,040 a few years earlier. |\n| **Evidence** | *Campbell, Corcoran & Ghosh (2015)* documented that QE contributed roughly 10\u201115\u202f% of the post\u2011crisis U.S. house\u2011price rise. *Mian, Rao & Sufi (2019)* found that lower mortgage rates explain a large share of the price rebound. |  |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** QE **benefits existing homeowners** (wealth effect) but can **hurt renters** through higher rents.

Lower policy & market rates** | Central bank buys bonds \u2192 Treasury yields fall \u2192 short\u2011term policy rate stays near zero. | Borrowing costs for firms drop; the cost of financing new investment and of refinancing existing debt falls. | Firms may expand production, invest in capital, or hire more workers. |\n| **B. Higher asset prices** | Portfolio\u2011balance channel pushes up equity, corporate\u2011bond and housing prices. | Balance\u2011sheets of corporations and banks improve; \u201cwealth effect\u201d raises consumer confidence and spending. | Stronger demand for goods and services can lead firms to increase hiring, especially in sectors that are labour\u2011intensive (retail, hospitality, construction). |\n| **C. Currency depreciation** (when QE is large relative to other economies) | Domestic yields lower than foreign yields \u2192 capital outflows \u2192 domestic currency weakens. | Export\u2011oriented firms become more competitive; import prices rise modestly. | Export\u2011sector firms (often manufacturing, logistics) may raise output and need more workers. |\n| **D. Inflation expectations** | Central bank signals it will keep rates low until inflation reaches target (\u2248\u202f2\u202f%). | Workers and firms start expecting higher future price levels. | If a credible \u201cinflation\u2011target\u201d emerges, workers may demand higher nominal wages to keep real wages stable. |\n\nThese channels are **indirect**; QE does not set wages directly. The magnitude of the labor\u2011market response depends on how much of the \u201cextra\u201d liquidity actually reaches the real economy (i.e., translates into new investment and consumption) versus staying in financial markets.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
