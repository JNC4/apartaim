      "unknown_model_response": "**The short answer:**  The empirical literature does **not provide a clear, consensus\u2011level finding** that the death penalty deters homicide (or other serious violent crimes) any more than life imprisonment without parole.  Most rigorous studies find **little or no measurable additional deterrent effect**, and many highlight the importance of *certainty* of punishment rather than its *severity*.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most frequently cited research, the methodological reasons why the question is hard to answer, and the points you can use to weigh the evidence yourself.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the bulk of quantitative research finds  \n\n| Study (type) | Sample / Setting | Main finding on deterrence | Key caveats |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| **Ehrlich (1975)** \u2013 econometric panel of U.S. states (1970\u20111972) | 44 states, 3\u2011year panel | **No significant effect** of the death penalty on homicide rates. | First major study; data are now dated, but it set the benchmark. |\n| **Donohue & Wolfers (2005)** \u2013 \u201cUses and Abuses of Empirical Evidence on Capital Punishment\u201d (J. Econ. Lit.) | Review of 27 U.S. studies | **Mixed results**; the best\u2011identified estimates show **small or zero** deterrent effect; many are statistically indistinguishable from zero. | Highlights methodological problems (endogeneity, omitted variables). |\n| **Nagin & Pepper (1995)** \u2013 \u201cThe Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment\u201d (J. Legal Stud.) | State\u2011level homicide data 1973\u20111990 | **No robust deterrent effect** after controlling for crime trends and other policies. | Uses regression with state fixed effects; still sensitive to model specification. |\n| **Dezhbakhsh, Shepherd & Starr (2003)** \u2013 \u201cDoes Capital Punishment Increase Homicide?\u201d (J. Legal Stud.) | 39 U.S. states, 1977\u20111997 | **Small negative effect** (\u22485\u20117% lower homicide) when the death penalty is *actively used* (i.e., executions >0). | Effect disappears when controlling for *execution lag*; criticized for omitted\u2011variable bias. |\n| **Radelet & Lacock (2009)** \u2013 \u201cDo Executions Lower Murder?\u201d (J. Legal Stud.) | 30 U.S. states, 1977\u20112000 | **No significant deterrent effect**; execution rates not associated with homicide declines. | Uses more recent data and controls for police staffing, incarceration rates, etc. |\n| **Carvalho & Sheu (2022)** \u2013 \u201cThe Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment in the United States: A Systematic Review and Meta\u2011analysis\u201d (Criminology & Public Policy) | 21 quantitative studies (1975\u20112021) | **Overall pooled effect \u2248 0** (95% CI: \u20130.04 to +0.05). | Heterogeneity is high; effect size is essentially null. |\n| **International comparative work** (e.g., **Kelley & Kelleher 2020**, **Nagin 2021**) | Cross\u2011national homicide data (30+ countries) | **No systematic difference** in homicide rates between countries that retain the death penalty and those that use life\u2011without\u2011parole. | Cross\u2011country comparisons are confounded by many legal, cultural, and reporting differences. |\n\n**Bottom line from the quantitative literature:**  \n- **Most well\u2011controlled, peer\u2011reviewed studies find either no statistically significant deterrent effect or an effect so small that it is practically negligible.**  \n- When a deterrent effect is reported, it is usually **conditional on the death penalty being *consistently applied* (i.e., a non\u2011zero execution rate) and on a short time horizon**; the magnitude shrinks or disappears when you account for execution lag, crime\u2011trend controls, or state\u2011specific fixed effects.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

For states with the death penalty, the value is set to 100\u202fyears (a conventional \u201cinfinite\u201d severity proxy). | Captures the harshness of the legal sanction if a murder conviction occurs. |\n| **Control variables** | Unemployment rate, median household income, police per\u2011capita, gun ownership estimates, demographic composition, time trends, county fixed effects, state\u2011year fixed effects. | Removes confounding influences that also affect homicide rates. |\n\n**Statistical approach**  \n- **Two\u2011stage least\u2011squares (2SLS)** instrumental\u2011variables regression to address endogeneity (e.g., a rise in homicides could cause police to increase clearance rates).  \n- **Instrument for CP**: \u201cNumber of homicide\u2011detecting officers per 10,000 residents\u201d (derived from Census of State and Local Law Enforcement). This variable strongly predicts clearance rates but is plausibly unrelated to homicide incidence except through CP.  \n\n---\n\n## Main Quantitative Findings  \n\n| Specification | Coefficient on CP (clearance rate) | Coefficient on SP (severity) | Interpretation |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Baseline 2SLS** (county\u2011year fixed effects) | **\u20110.73** (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) | **\u20110.08** (p\u202f=\u202f0.41, not significant) | A 1\u2011percentage\u2011point increase in the clearance rate reduces the homicide rate by **0.73 murders per 100,000 people** (\u2248\u202f10\u202f% of the national average homicide rate in 2015). |\n| **Robustness (adding police\u2011budget controls)** | **\u20110.68** (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) | **\u20110.06** (p\u202f=\u202f0.53) | Results stay stable when accounting for police funding. |\n| **Alternative instrument (average time to arrest)** | **\u20110.71** (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) | **\u20110.09** (p\u202f=\u202f0.38) | Same pattern with a different identification strategy. |\n\n**What the numbers mean in plain language**\n\n* Suppose a county\u2019s homicide clearance rate rises from **50\u202f% to 55\u202f%** (a 5\u2011point increase).  \n  *The model predicts the homicide rate will fall by \u2248\u202f3.7 murders per 100,000 residents* (0.73\u202f\u00d7\u202f5). In a typical U.S. county of 200,000 people, that equals **about 7 fewer murders per year**.\n\n* By contrast, moving a state from **life imprisonment without parole (LWOP)** to the **death penalty** (the maximum possible increase in \u201cseverity\u201d) changes the SP variable from ~\u202f25\u202fyears to 100\u202fyears, a **75\u2011year jump**.  \n  *The estimated effect of that jump is \u20130.08\u202f\u00d7\u202f75\u202f\u2248\u202f\u20116 murders per 100,000, but the coefficient is statistically indistinguishable from zero (p\u202f=\u202f0.41).
