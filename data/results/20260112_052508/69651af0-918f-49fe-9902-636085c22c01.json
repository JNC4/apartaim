What pasteurisation actually does\n\n| Process | Typical temperature\u2013time combos* | What is destroyed |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Most vegetative bacteria, many viruses |\n| **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs | Same as LTLT, plus a larger safety margin |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2011150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2011302\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20115\u202fs | Almost all microbes; gives shelf\u2011stable milk (no refrigeration needed) |\n\n*Exact parameters may vary by jurisdiction, but the goal is the same: achieve a **5\u2011log reduction** (99.999\u202f%) of *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* \u2013 the organism originally targeted by Dr. Pasteur.\n\nThe heat kills **vegetative cells** (the active, disease\u2011causing form of most bacteria). Spores (e.g., *Clostridium* spp.) are more heat\u2011resistant but are **rare in milk** when the herd is healthy and milking hygiene is good.  \n\n**Result:** A properly pasteurised product is *not sterile* (some non\u2011pathogenic bacteria survive), but it is **safe for the general population** when the process and subsequent handling are done correctly.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Pathogens most commonly found in raw milk\n\n| Pathogen | Typical disease | Frequency in raw\u2011milk outbreaks (U.S., 1993\u20112023) |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| *Salmonella* spp. | Gastroenteritis, septicemia | ~30\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks |\n| *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 & other STEC | Bloody diarrhea, HUS (hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome) | ~20\u202f% |\n| *Listeria monocyt",

How the outbreak was detected  \n\n| Date | Event |\n|------|-------|\n| **May\u202f3,\u202f2023** | The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) received a report of two patients (both children) with **bloody diarrhea** and **hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS)** who tested positive for STEC O157:H7. |\n| **May\u202f6\u20119,\u202f2023** | Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed the isolates from the two cases were **identical**, suggesting a common source. |\n| **May\u202f10\u202f\u2013\u202f12,\u202f2023** | CDPH alerted the CDC\u2019s Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) and began a *case\u2011finding* effort, reaching out to hospitals and labs in neighboring states (Nevada, Arizona, Oregon). |\n| **May\u202f15,\u202f2023** | A total of **9 laboratory\u2011confirmed cases** (7 children, 2 adults) were identified, all of whom reported consuming **raw milk** from the same farm within the previous 7\u201110\u202fdays. |\n| **May\u202f18,\u202f2023** | The farm\u2019s **herd\u2011share** contract was voluntarily suspended; the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) issued a **temporary prohibition** on the sale of raw milk from that operation. |\n\n*Sources:* CDC \u201cOutbreak of Shiga toxin\u2011producing *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 associated with raw milk \u2014 California, 2023\u201d (MMWR, 2023); California Department of Public Health press release, 19\u202fMay\u202f2023.\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Heat\u2011Treatment (Pasteurisation) Inactivates Pathogens \u2013 The Science Behind It  \n\n### 1. What \u201cpasteurisation\u201d actually does to microorganisms  \n\n| Step | What the heat does at the molecular level | What the organism loses |\n|------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Denaturation of proteins** (including enzymes, structural proteins, ribosomal proteins) | Heat breaks hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, and other non\u2011covalent forces that keep a protein\u2019s three\u2011dimensional shape intact. | Enzymes can no longer catalyse metabolism; structural proteins can\u2019t hold the cell together \u2192 cell collapses. |\n| **Disruption of cell membranes and walls** | Phospholipid bilayers become more fluid and eventually melt; membrane proteins unfold. In Gram\u2011negative bacteria the outer membrane is especially heat\u2011sensitive. | Loss of selective permeability \u2192 leakage of cytoplasmic contents, collapse of the proton motive force, and death. |\n| **Damage to nucleic acids** (DNA & RNA) | Heat can cause depurination, strand breakage, and cross\u2011linking, especially when combined with reactive oxygen species generated during heating. | Replication and transcription stop; even if the cell were otherwise intact it can\u2019t reproduce. |\n| **Inactivation of viruses** | Enveloped viruses (e.g., hepatitis A, rotavirus) lose their lipid envelope; non\u2011enveloped viruses (e.g., norovirus) suffer capsid protein denaturation. | Loss of ability to bind to host cells and inject genetic material. |\n| **Reduction of spores (if any)** | Spores are highly resistant; standard LTL/HTST pasteurisation does **not** reliably kill them. Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) or sterilisation (121\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fpsi for 15\u202fmin) is needed for spores. | Most spores survive LTL/HTST, but they are rarely present in milk from healthy herds. |\n\nThe net effect is a **log\u2011reduction** (a factor of ten reduction) in the number of viable microorganisms. Commercial pasteurisation is designed to achieve **\u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction** (99.999\u202f% kill) of the *target* pathogen *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* \u2013 a benchmark that also eliminates the far more common food\u2011borne bacteria found in milk.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
