What \u201c10\u202fmW\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2\u201d really means\n\n| Quantity | Value used in the lab | Unit conversion | What it looks like |\n|----------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| Power\u2011density (PD) | **10\u202fmW\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2** | 10\u202fmW\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 = **100\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2** = **10\u202f\u00b5W\u202fmm\u207b\u00b2** | Equivalent to the surface heat flux from a **100\u2011W incandescent bulb placed 1\u202fcm away**. |\n| Reference limits (ICNIRP, 2020) | \u2022 Occupational limit (60\u202fGHz): **10\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2**  <br>\u2022 General\u2011public limit (60\u202fGHz): **0.1\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2** | 10\u202fmW\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 is **1\u202f000\u00d7** the occupational limit and **100\u202f000\u00d7** the public limit. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Typical radiated power of a 5G small\u2011cell site\n\n| Parameter | Typical range (2022\u20112024 commercial deployments) |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Maximum Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)** \u2013 sub\u20116\u202fGHz (3.5\u202fGHz) | **10\u202fW \u2013 30\u202fW** (\u2248\u202f40\u201145\u202fdBm) for a sector antenna; many indoor/roof\u2011mounted units run at **\u2264\u202f10\u202fW**. |\n| **Maximum EIRP \u2013 mmWave (26\u201128\u202fGHz)** | **0.5\u202fW \u2013 2\u202fW** (\u2248\u202f27\u201133\u202fdBm) because of higher path loss and tighter beam\u2011forming. |\n| **Antenna gain (typical) \u2013 sub\u20116\u202fGHz** | 8\u201112\u202fdBi (panel) to 15\u201118\u202fdBi (sector). |\n| **Antenna gain \u2013 mmWave** | 20\u201130\u202fdBi (highly directional arrays). |\n| **Physical height above ground** | 4\u201112\u202fm for outdoor street\u2011level units; 2\u20116\u202fm for indoor \u201csmall cells\u201d. |\n| **Duty cycle** | Continuous transmission, but **traffic\u2011dependent power control** reduces the instantaneous radiated power by 3\u201110\u202fdB during low\u2011traffic periods. |\n\n*Key point*: Even the **maximum** EIRP of a small\u2011cell base\u2011station is **two orders of magnitude lower** than the **10\u202fW** (\u2248\u202f100\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2) PD used in the lab experiment.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
