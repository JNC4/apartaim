      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise overall economic efficiency, but the gains are unevenly distributed.  In most cases workers in export\u2011oriented, relatively skilled sectors see higher employment and wages, while workers in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill industries often face job loss or slower wage growth.  The net effect for a country as a whole is usually modest\u2011positive for average income, but the distributional impact depends heavily on a nation\u2019s labor\u2011market institutions, the design of the agreement, and the presence of complementary policies (e.g., retraining, unemployment insurance, labor\u2011rights clauses).\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the evidence shows\n\n| Outcome | Typical direction of the effect | How strong the evidence is | Key studies / sources |\n|---------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Aggregate employment** | Small net increase or no change in total jobs. | Moderate \u2013 meta\u2011analyses of many country\u2011level case studies. | \u2022 *World Bank, 2020* \u201cTrade and Employment\u201d; <br>\u2022 *Baldwin & Evenett, 2020* \u201cCOVID\u201119 and Trade Policy\u201d. |\n| **Sectoral job shifts** | Gains in export\u2011oriented, higher\u2011skill sectors; losses in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill sectors. | Strong \u2013 consistent across OECD, US, and developing\u2011country studies. | \u2022 *Autor, Dorn & Hanson, 2013* \u201cThe China Shock\u201d; <br>\u2022 *OECD, 2021* \u201cTrade and Labour Market Adjustment\u201d. |\n| **Wages** | Average wages rise modestly (\u22480.5\u20112\u202f% of GDP) in the long run; however, wage growth is larger for skilled workers and smaller (or negative) for low\u2011skill workers in affected industries. | Moderate \u2013 depends on data quality and time horizon. | \u2022 *IMF, 2021* \u201cWorld Economic Outlook\u201d; <br>\u2022 *Berg, 2020* \u201cTrade, Labor, and the Wage Gap\u201d. |\n| **Working\u2011hours & job quality** | Mixed: some studies find longer hours and more precarious contracts in sectors that expand; others find improved occupational safety where labor\u2011clause enforcement is strong. | Low\u2011moderate \u2013 fewer systematic surveys. | \u2022 *ILO, 2019* \u201cTrade, Globalisation and Labour\u201d. |\n| **Income inequality** | FTAs tend to increase within\u2011country inequality when adjustment mechanisms are weak, because gains concentrate in higher\u2011skill groups. | Moderate \u2013 supported by cross\u2011country regressions. | \u2022 *Baldwin, 2016* \u201cThe Great Trade Collapse\u201d; <br>\u2022 *Kreindler & Sutherland, 2022* \u201cTrade Liberalisation and Inequality\u201d. |\n| **Consumer welfare** | Prices of imported goods fall, raising real purchasing power for most households (including low\u2011income ones). | Strong \u2013 basic price\u2011elasticity calculations. | \u2022 *WTO, 2022* \u201cTrade and Consumer Benefits\u201d. |\n| **Labor\u2011rights provisions** | Where FTAs include enforceable labour chapters, there is evidence of modest improvements in workplace safety and collective\u2011bargaining coverage. | Emerging \u2013 limited to newer agreements (e.g., USMCA, EU\u2011Canada CETA). | \u2022 *Berg & Ostry, 2021* \u201cTrade Agreements and Labour Standards\u201d. |\n\n### 1.1 Aggregate vs. distributional effects\n- **Macroeconomic studies** (World Bank, IMF, OECD) consistently find that FTAs raise a country\u2019s *real GDP per\u2011capita* by roughly **0.5\u20112\u202f%** over the first 5\u201110\u202fyears after implementation, mainly through lower input costs and expanded export markets.\n- **Distributional analyses** show that the average gain masks *large sectoral reallocation*.
