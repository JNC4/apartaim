The effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is limited by national regulations (e.g., FCC\u202f\u2264\u202f100\u202fW\u202fEIRP for most 5G bands in the US). |\n| **How exposure falls off with distance** | RF intensity follows the inverse\u2011square law: at 10\u202fm from a panel the power density is roughly 0.1\u20131\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2; at 100\u202fm it is 100\u2011fold lower.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nAll major national and international health\u2011science bodies (WHO, IARC, ICNIRP, FCC, the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks \u2013 SCENIHR, the US National Toxicology Program, etc.) conclude that, **at the exposure levels that people actually experience from 5G base\u2011stations and user equipment, there is no credible evidence of adverse health effects**. The consensus is that the radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields used for 5G are well\u2011covered by existing safety limits, which are based on the only biologically\u2011proven mechanism\u2014**tissue heating**.  \n\nThat does **not** mean the question is closed forever. The scientific record contains a small but growing set of studies that explore possible *non\u2011thermal* effects, and the long\u2011term epidemiology of the newest 5G frequencies (especially the millimetre\u2011wave bands above 24\u202fGHz) is still limited. Those uncertainties are openly acknowledged by the agencies that set the limits, and they are the focus of ongoing research.\n\nBelow is a structured, evidence\u2011based overview that tries to capture the full picture\u2014what is well\u2011established, what is still debated, and where the gaps lie.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

In many deployments the power density is actually lower because the high\u2011frequency beams are tightly focused and the transmit power is reduced to stay within the same regulatory limits.\n\n---\n\n",

The only microscopic changes observed were the usual background findings (e.g., occasional focal necrosis in the liver) that were equally present in controls. <br>5. **Behavior:** Open\u2011field distance travelled and rotarod latency were indistinguishable across groups. |\n| **Authors\u2019 conclusion** | \u201cChronic whole\u2011body exposure to 28\u202fGHz mmWave radiation at up to **5\u202fmW/cm\u00b2** does **not** produce observable adverse health effects in rats under the conditions tested.

Consequently, the same thermal\u2011based limits are used for the higher frequencies; a separate \u201cnon\u2011thermal\u201d limit is **not** established by the major regulatory bodies. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** All internationally recognised limits (ICNIRP, IEEE, FCC, etc.) are **thermal limits** \u2013 they guarantee that the absorbed energy is far too low to cause any measurable heating, and the available evidence shows that no other mechanism is triggered at those levels.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The two principal exposure metrics  \n\n| Metric | When it is used | Physical definition | Typical regulatory value for the **general public** |\n|--------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)** | Frequencies **\u2264\u202f6\u202fGHz** (e.g., 3G, 4G, sub\u20116\u202fGHz 5G). | SAR = (Power absorbed per unit mass) = **W\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9**. It is derived from the electric field inside tissue:  SAR = \u03c3\u00b7|E|\u00b2 / \u03c1, where \u03c3 = conductivity (S\u202fm\u207b\u00b9), E = electric field strength (V\u202fm\u207b\u00b9), \u03c1 = tissue density (kg\u202fm\u207b\u00b3). | **2\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9** averaged over 10\u202fg of tissue (ICNIRP/IEEE). In the U.S. the FCC adopts **1.6\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9** averaged over 1\u202fg. |\n| **Power\u2011Flux Density (PFD)** | Frequencies **>\u202f6\u202fGHz**, where the wavelength is so short that the field does not penetrate deeply (mmWave). | PFD = **incident power per unit area** = **W\u202fm\u207b\u00b2** (or equivalently **mW\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2**). In the far\u2011field of an antenna PFD = E\u00b2/377\u202f\u03a9 = H\u00b2\u00b7377\u202f\u03a9, where E is the electric\u2011field strength (V\u202fm\u207b\u00b9) and H is the magnetic\u2011field strength (A\u202fm\u207b\u00b9). | **0.08\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2** (\u2248\u202f8\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2) for the general public at **24\u201186\u202fGHz** (ICNIRP 2020). The U.S. FCC uses **0.1\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2** (10\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2) for the same band. |\n\n> **Why the switch?**  \n> For >\u202f6\u202fGHz the energy is absorbed within the outer millimetre of skin, so",
