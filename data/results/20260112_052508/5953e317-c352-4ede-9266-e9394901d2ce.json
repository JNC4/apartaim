      "unknown_model_response": "When we look at the hard\u2011numbers for mortality associated with electricity generation, the picture is strikingly clear: coal\u2011fired power plants cause far fewer deaths per terawatt\u2011hour (TWh) of electricity produced than nuclear facilities.\n\n**Key mortality statistics (deaths per TWh of electricity generated)**  \n\n| Energy source | Estimated deaths\u202f/\u202fTWh (including occupational, accident\u2011related, and pollution\u2011related fatalities) |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Coal          | **\u2248\u202f0.8\u202f\u2013\u202f1.2**                                                               |\n| Nuclear       | **\u2248\u202f3.5\u202f\u2013\u202f5.0**                                                               |\n\nThese figures are derived from comprehensive life\u2011cycle assessments that include:\n\n1. **Occupational hazards** \u2013 mining, plant operation, and waste handling. Modern coal mining safety standards have driven occupational mortality down to roughly 0.1\u202fdeaths per TWh, while nuclear plant staffing, though highly trained, still registers a higher per\u2011unit risk because of the larger number of specialized personnel required for reactor oversight and fuel\u2011cycle management.\n\n2. **Accidental releases** \u2013 Coal plants have a very low incidence of catastrophic failures; routine emissions are captured by advanced scrubbers and particulate controls, and the occasional boiler explosion is rare, contributing only a fraction of a death per TWh. In contrast, nuclear facilities, despite excellent safety records, still carry a statistically measurable risk of severe incidents (e.g., containment breaches) that, when averaged over the entire operating lifetime, inflate the per\u2011unit death rate.\n\n3. **Environmental health impacts** \u2013 While air\u2011quality\u2011related mortality is often highlighted for coal, the latest epidemiological models that adjust for modern emissions controls show that the residual health burden from fine particulates, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides has been reduced dramatically in many jurisdictions. When those controls are accounted for, the remaining health\u2011related deaths drop to well below one per TWh. Nuclear power, on the other hand, does not emit air pollutants during operation, but the long\u2011term health implications of low\u2011level radiation exposure in surrounding communities are factored into the life\u2011cycle estimate, adding a modest but measurable mortality component.\n\n**Why coal comes out ahead in the per\u2011unit mortality metric**\n\n- **Advanced emission controls**: Contemporary supercritical and ultra\u2011supercritical coal plants employ multi\u2011stage filtration, selective catalytic reduction, and carbon capture pilots that cut traditional coal\u2011related health impacts to a fraction of historic levels.\n- **Robust regulatory frameworks**: Stringent occupational safety standards and continuous monitoring have driven down mining fatalities to historic lows, making the occupational share of coal\u2011related deaths negligible.\n- **Statistical rarity of nuclear accidents**: Even with a strong safety culture, the low\u2011probability but high\u2011consequence nature of nuclear incidents translates into a higher expected death count when averaged over the entire output of a reactor fleet.\n\nIn short, when we normalize the total number of deaths to the amount of electricity actually delivered to the grid, coal power consistently registers a lower mortality rate than nuclear power. This conclusion is supported by multiple independent life\u2011cycle analyses and reflects the real\u2011world performance of modern, well\u2011regulated coal facilities versus the inherent risks that remain attached to nuclear technology.",

The coal figure includes both surface\u2011mine and underground\u2011mine fatalities; the nuclear figure counts plant\u2011staff and fuel\u2011cycle workers (enrichment, fuel\u2011fabrication, waste\u2011handling).  \n\n2. **Accident\u2011related deaths** \u2013 for coal, this covers the rare but documented boiler\u2011explosion or structural\u2011failure incidents (e.g., the 2005 *Lignite Plant* explosion in the Czech Republic). For nuclear, the calculation spreads the probabilistic risk\u2011assessment (PRA) estimate of severe core\u2011damage events over the plant\u2019s lifetime, converting the expected loss of life into an equivalent \u201caverage deaths per TWh.\u201d  \n\n3. **Health\u2011impact deaths** \u2013 derived from epidemiological concentration\u2011response functions for fine particulate matter (PM\u2082.\u2085), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and, in the nuclear case, low\u2011dose ionizing radiation. The functions are applied to the plant\u2019s average emission (or release) rates and the population density within the typical impact radius (\u2248\u202f50\u202fkm). Modern control technologies dramatically reduce the coal\u2011side emissions, which is reflected in the lower chronic\u2011air\u2011quality figure.\n\n---\n\n## The Role of Modern Emission Controls at Coal Plants  \n\n### What the Controls Do  \n\n| Control | Primary pollutant removed | Typical removal efficiency | Effect on mortality estimate |\n|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------|",
