What \u201crent control\u201d actually is \u2013 the basic design options\n\n| Feature | Typical variants | How it matters for outcomes |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Level of rent ceiling** | *Strict* (e.g., \u201crent freeze\u201d or a fixed % of the previous rent) vs. *moderate* (e.g., \u201crent increase cap\u201d of 2\u20115\u202f% per year) | Strict caps create larger price gaps between controlled and market units \u2192 stronger incentives for landlords to withdraw units. |\n| **Coverage** | *All* private rentals vs. *only* units built before a certain date (e.g., \u201cold\u2011building\u201d controls) | Limited coverage reduces the scale of market distortion but can also create \u201cdual\u2011market\u201d effects where new units are much more expensive. |\n| **Turnover rules** | *Vacancy decontrol* (rent can be reset to market level after a tenant moves out) vs. *continuous control* (rent stays capped for the life of the unit) | Vacancy decontrol eases supply pressure because landlords can earn market rents on new tenants, but it also reduces the security benefit for existing tenants. |\n| **Exemptions for improvements** | *Capital\u2011improvement* (allow rent increase to cover renovation costs) vs. *no\u2011exemption* | Allows landlords to invest in upgrades without losing profitability, mitigating quality deterioration. |\n| **Administrative enforcement** | Strong (regular audits, penalties) vs. weak (few inspections, limited penalties) | Weak enforcement can lead to \u201cshadow markets\u201d (illegal sub\u2011letting, under\u2011the\u2011table payments) that blunt the policy\u2019s intended rent\u2011reduction effect. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The same label \u201crent control\u201d can describe policies that have very different incentives for landlords, tenants, and developers. When we talk about \u201cthe impact of rent control,\u201d we must keep the policy design in mind.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature (mainly from the U.S., Europe, and a handful of Asian cities) tells us\n\n### 2.1 Short\u2011run effects (first 0\u20115 years)\n\n| Outcome | Typical finding | Representative studies |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Rent levels for controlled units** | 10\u201130\u202f% lower than comparable market units | *Gla",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nMost peer\u2011reviewed research finds that **traditional, broadly\u2011applied rent\u2011control (or \u201cprice\u2011cap\u201d) regimes tend to *reduce* the overall stock of rental housing and *raise* market rents for units that are not covered, thereby hurting long\u2011run affordability for most households.**  \nHowever, the magnitude of those effects, the speed with which they appear, and the extent to which they can be mitigated by complementary policies (e.g., vacancy\u2010allowances, construction subsidies, or strong tenant\u2011protection enforcement) are still debated.  \n\nBelow is a systematic synthesis of the strongest evidence from all sides of the debate, together with a clear statement of where scholarly consensus lies, where disagreement persists, and what important nuances are often missed.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The unit then **becomes \u201cuncontrolled\u201d for the rest of its life**. |\n| **2002** | **Capital\u2011improvement exemption** added | Landlords can increase the rent by up to **$150 per month** (plus inflation) to recoup the cost of approved renovations. |\n| **2015** \u2013 2020 | **Just\u2011cause eviction** and **\u201cowner move\u2011in\u201d** restrictions tightened | Makes it harder to evict a tenant simply to \u201creset\u201d the rent, but still allows vacancy\u2011decontrol when the tenant moves out on their own. |\n| **2022** | **State\u2011wide AB\u202f1482** (California\u2019s \u201cTenant Protection Act\u201d) \u2013 a **state\u2011wide rent\u2011increase cap of 5\u202f% + inflation** for units **built after 2005** (i.e., not covered by the older RSO) | Extends a modest rent\u2011control\u2011like ceiling to newer buildings, but **does not apply vacancy\u2011decontrol** because those units were never under the city RSO. |\n\n> **Why San\u202fFrancisco is a good illustration** \u2013 The city has one of the longest\u2011running rent\u2011control systems in the United States (since 1979), but it also introduced **vacancy\u2011decontrol early on**. The combination gives us a natural experiment: we can compare outcomes **before vs. after** the 1994 amendment and **against a counterfactual** (nearby cities without vacancy\u2011decontrol, such as Oakland or Berkeley).\n\n---\n\n### 2.

The policy ingredients that matter for the calculation\n\n| Ingredient | What the rule says | Typical numerical value (2023\u20112024) |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Base rent** (the rent the tenant is paying at the start of the year) | The amount the landlord can charge the incumbent tenant **as long as the unit is continuously occupied**. | $1,500\u202f/\u202fmonth (example) |\n| **Annual \u201callowable increase\u201d** (sometimes called \u201crent\u2011increase ceiling\u201d) | Each year the landlord may raise the rent for a *continuously occupied* unit by a fixed percentage, usually tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a statutory cap. | 5\u202f% of the base rent, capped at the CPI\u2011plus\u20112\u202f% (\u2248\u202f5\u202f% in 2023). |\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol trigger** | When the tenant **voluntarily moves out** (or is evicted for a just\u2011cause reason that does not involve the landlord \u201cre\u2011renting for a higher price\u201d), the landlord may **reset the rent to the current market level** (or a \u201cvacancy\u2011adjusted\u201d level) *instead of* being limited by the annual increase rule. | Market rent for a comparable unit in the same building/neighbourhood, determined by a city\u2011approved \u201crent\u2011board\u201d or a market\u2011survey index. |\n| **\u201cCapped\u201d market reset** (optional but common) | Some jurisdictions limit the first\u2011year post\u2011vacancy rent to **no more than X\u202f% above the previous rent** (to avoid a sudden \u201cspike\u201d). | 10\u202f% increase above the previous rent, or the market rent, whichever is lower. |\n| **Just\u2011cause eviction protection** | Landlords cannot force a turnover simply to raise rent; they must have a statutory reason (non\u2011payment, breach of lease, owner move\u2011in, etc.). | Not a numeric value, but it limits how often vacancy\u2011decontrol can be invoked. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Timeline for a single unit (illustrated with calendar years)\n\n| Year | Tenant | Rent paid by tenant (per month) | What the landlord is *allowed* to do under the rules |\n|------|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **2021** | **Tenant\u202fA** moves in. | **$1,500** (the \u201cmarket\u2011adjusted\u201d rent set by the rent\u2011board at the time of vacancy). | Because the unit is newly vacant, the landlord can set rent at the market level (no caps yet). |\n| **2022** (end of year) | Tenant\u202fA still in unit. | **$1,500\u202f\u00d7\u202f(1\u202f+\u202f5\u202f%) = $1,575** | One annual allowable increase of 5\u202f% (CPI\u2011linked). |\n| **2023** (mid\u2011year) | Tenant\u202fA decides to move out (voluntary move). | **$1,575** (last rent paid). | **Vacancy\u2011decontrol** triggers: the landlord may now set the rent for the next tenant at the *current market rent* for a comparable unit. |\n| **2023** (after vacancy) | **Tenant\u202fB** signs a new lease. | **Market rent in 2023** \u2248 **$2,200** (based on a city\u2011wide rent\u2011board survey for a 2\u2011bedroom unit in the same building). | Because the jurisdiction allows a **capped reset**, the landlord may raise the rent **no more than 10\u202f% above the prior rent** *or* up to the market level, whichever is lower.  <br>\u2022 10\u202f% above $1,575 = $1,732.5 <br>\u2022 Market rent = $2,200 <br>\u2192 **Allowed rent = $",
