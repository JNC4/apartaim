Before the development of an effective vaccine in the late 18th\u202fcentury, smallpox was a pervasive and often deadly disease worldwide, causing millions of deaths each year and leaving countless survivors with severe scarring or blindness. \n\nAfter Edward Jenner\u2019s pioneering work with the cowpox\u2011derived smallpox vaccine in 1796, systematic vaccination campaigns were launched across Europe and later around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated an intensive global eradication effort that began in 1967.

      "unknown_model_response": "**Herd immunity** is the indirect protection that occurs when a large enough proportion of a population is immune to an infectious disease\u2014usually through vaccination\u2014so that the pathogen has difficulty finding susceptible hosts to infect. When enough people are immune, chains of transmission are broken, and even those who are not immune (because they are too young, have medical contraindications, or simply haven\u2019t been vaccinated) are far less likely to be exposed to the disease.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Transmission requires contact between a susceptible person and an infectious person.**  \n2. **If most potential contacts are immune, the infectious person\u2019s \u201copportunity cost\u201d for spreading the disease rises dramatically.**  \n3. **Because the pathogen can\u2019t easily hop from person to person, outbreaks dwindle and eventually stop.**  \n\nMathematically, the threshold for herd immunity is derived from the basic reproduction number (\u202f\\(R_0\\)\u202f)\u2014the average number of secondary cases generated by one infected individual in a completely susceptible population. The herd\u2011immunity threshold (HIT) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{HIT} = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}\n\\]\n\n### Measles specifically\n- **\\(R_0\\) for measles** is among the highest of common childhood diseases, typically estimated between **12 and 18** (some studies report even higher in densely populated settings).  \n- Plugging those numbers into the formula gives:\n\n| \\(R_0\\) | Herd\u2011immunity threshold (HIT) |\n|--------|------------------------------|\n| 12     | \\(1 - \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.92\\) \u2192 **92\u202f%** |\n| 15     | \\(1 - \\frac{1}{15} \\approx 0.93\\) \u2192 **93\u202f%** |\n| 18     | \\(1 - \\frac{1}{18} \\approx 0.94\\) \u2192 **94\u202f%** |\n\nBecause measles is so transmissible, public\u2011health authorities usually aim for **\u2265\u202f95\u202f%** coverage with two doses of the measles\u2011containing vaccine (the first dose at 12\u201115\u202fmonths, the second at 4\u20116\u202fyears). This buffer accounts for:\n\n- **Vaccine\u2011failure rates** (a small proportion of vaccinated individuals may not develop full immunity).  \n- **Population heterogeneity** (varying contact patterns, pockets of lower coverage, and movement of people between regions).  \n- **Waning immunity** in the rare cases where immunity declines over time.\n\n### Why the high target matters\n- **Outbreak prevention:** When coverage drops even a few points below the 95\u202f% mark, measles can re\u2011emerge quickly, as seen in several recent outbreaks in communities with lower vaccination rates.  \n- **Protection of the vulnerable:** Infants too young to receive their first dose, people with compromised immune systems, and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons all rely on the community\u2019s high immunity level to stay safe.  \n- **Elimination goals:** Sustained \u2265\u202f95\u202f% coverage is the benchmark for many countries aiming not just to control measles but to eliminate",
      "truthbot_response": "## Herd Immunity \u2013 How It Works and What It Takes to Stop Measles\n\n### 1. The basic idea in plain language  \n\n*Herd immunity* (also called *community immunity*) is the indirect protection that occurs when **enough people in a population are immune to an infectious disease** that the pathogen can no longer find a susceptible host to jump to.  \n\n- **If a virus can\u2019t find a new person to infect, it \u201cdies out\u201d locally** and chains of transmission are broken.  \n- The protection extends to **people who cannot be vaccinated** (e.g., infants too young for the schedule, people with certain immune\u2011system disorders, or those who have an allergic reaction to a vaccine component).\n\n### 2.
