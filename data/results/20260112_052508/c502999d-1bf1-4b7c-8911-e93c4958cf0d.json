      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to **raise average real wages in the signatory economies over the medium\u2011 to long\u2011run**, but the effect is **uneven**:\n\n* **Workers in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011productivity sectors** (often skilled or semi\u2011skilled) usually see **higher wages and better job growth**.  \n* **Workers in import\u2011competing, low\u2011productivity sectors** (often low\u2011skill) can experience **wage pressure or job loss**, at least during the adjustment period.  \n\nThe net impact on **overall job security** depends on how quickly labor markets can re\u2011allocate workers, the presence of \u201csafety\u2011net\u201d policies (unemployment insurance, active\u2011labour\u2011market programmes), and the strength of collective\u2011bargaining institutions. In many cases, **total employment does not fall**, but **the composition of jobs changes** (more jobs in services/technology, fewer in traditional manufacturing or agriculture).\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that separates what is well\u2011established from what remains debated, and that highlights the mechanisms that drive the observed outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical background \u2013 why FTAs can affect wages and job security\n\n| Mechanism | Expected direction of effect | Core assumptions |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| **Comparative advantage & specialization** | Workers move to sectors where the country has a relative productivity edge \u2192 higher aggregate productivity \u2192 higher average real wages. | Markets are competitive; factor mobility is not perfectly frictionless. |\n| **Import competition** | Lower\u2011cost imports can depress wages or displace workers in industries that cannot compete (e.g., low\u2011skill manufacturing). | Firms cannot instantly adjust; some sectors have \u201csticky\u201d costs (e.g., capital\u2011intensive). |\n| **Export expansion** | Access to larger markets raises demand for export\u2011oriented industries, raising wages and creating jobs. | Firms can meet extra demand without large productivity losses. |\n| **Technology transfer & foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI)** | Multinationals bring higher\u2011skill technologies \u2192 \u201cskill\u2011biased\u201d demand \u2192 wage gains for skilled workers. | Host\u2011country institutions allow FDI and protect property rights. |\n| **Labor\u2011market institutions** | Strong unions or minimum\u2011wage laws can capture some of the productivity gains \u2192 higher wages for a broader set of workers. | Institutional rigidity may also limit reallocations. |\n| **Adjustment costs** | Short\u2011run job losses in declining sectors; possible \u201cstructural unemployment\u201d if workers cannot retrain. | Presence (or absence) of active labour\u2011market policies. |\n\nThese mechanisms are **not mutually exclusive**; the net outcome is the result of several forces acting simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Overall**: The bulk of scholarly work finds that free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) raise aggregate output and total employment in the partner economies, but the *distribution* of those gains is highly uneven.  \n- **Wages**: In high\u2011income signatories, low\u2011skill wages tend to **flatten or fall modestly**, while high\u2011skill wages rise. In low\u2011 and middle\u2011income signatories, average wages usually **increase**, especially in export\u2011oriented sectors, but the gains are uneven across regions, industries, and demographic groups.  \n- **Job security**: FTAs generate **sectoral re\u2011allocation** \u2013 jobs are created in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011productivity industries and lost in import\u2011competing sectors. The net effect on total employment is often neutral to slightly positive, but **individual workers can experience abrupt job loss**, especially where adjustment assistance or active\u2011labour\u2011market policies are weak.\n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based map of what is **well\u2011established**, what remains **debated**, and what is **still uncertain**. It also highlights studies that are frequently omitted and points out common misconceptions on all sides of the debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical baseline (what most economists agree on)\n\n| Mechanism | Expected effect on wages & job security |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Comparative advantage** (Ricardo, 1817) | Resources (including labour) shift to sectors where a country has a relative cost advantage. Aggregate output rises; sector\u2011specific employment changes. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin, 1935) | Trade tends to *raise* the return to abundant factors (e.g., low\u2011skill labour in a low\u2011wage country) and *lower* the return to scarce factors (e.g., low\u2011skill labour in a high\u2011wage country). |\n| **Skill\u2011biased technological change** (helped by trade\u2011induced competition) | Often amplifies the wage gap: high\u2011skill workers see larger gains, low\u2011skill workers see smaller or negative gains. |\n| **Dynamic gains** (scale economies, knowledge spill\u2011overs) | Over the medium\u2011long term, productivity growth can raise wages across the board, but only after an adjustment period. |\n| **Adjustment costs** (short\u2011run) | Workers displaced from shrinking industries may face temporary unemployment, lower wages, or the need to relocate/geographically retrain. |\n\n**Consensus**: Nearly all mainstream trade economists (e.g., WTO, IMF, World Bank) accept that FTAs generate *net positive* gains to national welfare, but they stress that *distributional* outcomes depend on the structure of the labour market, the skill",

His net cash\u2011crop income averages **\u2248\u202f2,500\u202fMXN per month** (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$120 in 1992 prices). |\n| **Early NAFTA years (1994\u20111999)** | Tariffs on U.S. corn are cut to **0\u202f%** (1994). U.S. corn imports rise sharply (by ~40\u202f% of total Mexican corn supply by 1998). The government reduces its grain\u2011price support program. | \u2022 **Price pressure**: The farm\u2011gate price of corn falls by ~15\u202f% (real terms). <br>\u2022 **Yield pressure**: Juan\u202fCarlos cannot compete with higher\u2011yield U.S. corn that is sold cheaply in Mexican supermarkets. <br>\u2022 **Income shock**: His monthly cash\u2011crop earnings drop to **\u2248\u202f1,800\u202fMXN**. <br>\u2022 **Coping response**: He reduces the area devoted to corn, shifts 0.5\u202fha to beans (a less\u2011import\u2011competed crop), and starts a **seasonal migration** job picking fruit in the coastal state of Veracruz during the off\u2011season (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$4 per day). |\n| **Medium\u2011term (2000\u20112008)** | NAFTA\u2011related growth in export\u2011oriented manufacturing creates a **new demand for low\u2011skill labour** in the border states; the Mexican government expands \u201ctemporary migration\u201d permits (Programa de Trabajo Temporal). | \u2022 **Remittances**: Juan\u202fCarlos\u2019s brother, who works in a Tijuana plant, begins sending **\u2248\u202f2,000\u202fMXN per month** back home. <br>\u2022 **Household consumption** rises modestly (better nutrition, a small television). <br>\u2022 **Labour market pull**: Juan\u202fCarlos applies for a **temporary agricultural contract** in Sonora (seasonal cotton picking) but is turned away because the plant\u2019s *preferred* workers are **young men with some basic schooling** (a pattern documented in the ILO 2017 study). <br>\u2022 **Outcome**: He remains a **small\u2011holder farmer** with lower corn income, partially offset by remittances, but his **own labour market security has not improved**. |\n| **Later NAFTA/USMCA era (2009\u20112020)** | The **US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA)** raises the \u201cregional value\u2011content\u201d rule for autos, spurring modest expansion of auto\u2011parts plants in central Mexico, but does **little** for high\u2011land agriculture. Climate\u2011change\u2011related droughts (2009\u20112014) further compress farm yields. | \u2022 **Income trend**: Real farm income in Chiapas continues to **lag the national average**, growing only ~1\u202f% per year versus ~3\u202f% for the country overall (World Bank 2014 regional data). <br>\u2022 **Migration decision**: Juan\u202fCarlos, now 53, decides to **permanently relocate** to the city of Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez to work as a **construction labor",
