Participation is *voluntary* in most U.S. programs; some countries (e.g., Australia) have required surrender of certain categories of guns after a deadline. |\u202fVoluntary \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events, recurring \u201cmonthly/quarterly\u201d drives, or nationwide mandatory surrender periods. |\n| **How are guns turned in?** |\u202fOwners bring the gun (often unloaded) to a designated site (police station, community center, school, etc.). Most programs allow anonymity (no name or ID required) to reduce fear of prosecution. |\u202fAnonymous drop\u2011boxes, staffed \u201ccheck\u2011in\u201d tables, or mail\u2011in options (rare). |\n| **What incentive is offered?** |\u202fCash or voucher payments per firearm (often $50\u2011$200 in the U.S., higher for \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d or \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d weapons). Some programs give non\u2011cash items (gift cards, coupons, public\u2011service\u2011award points). |\u202fFlat\u2011rate per gun vs. tiered rates (higher for rifles, lower for pistols). Some jurisdictions add a bonus for \u201cdangerous\u201d weapons. |\n| **Funding & logistics** |\u202fFinanced by municipal, state, or federal budgets; sometimes by private foundations or corporate sponsors. Police or a contracted vendor handles collection, cataloguing, and destruction (usually shredding, melting, or crushing). |\u202fSome programs partner with NGOs that provide outreach and education. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** |\u202fThey are rendered inoperable and then either sold as scrap metal or destroyed. In a few places the weapons are kept for forensic research or museum display. |\u202fDestruction methods: mechanical shredding, high\u2011temperature melting, or de\u2011activation (removing firing pin/trigger). |\n\n---\n\n## What the research says about *impact on gun violence*\n\n### 1. Overall findings \u2013 a \u201cmixed but modest\u201d picture\nA 2022 systematic review of 31 studies from the United States, Canada, Australia, New\u202fZealand, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and several European nations concluded:\n\n* **No consistent, large\u2011scale reduction** in homicide, suicide, or overall firearm injury rates can be attributed solely to voluntary buybacks.  \n* **Small, short\u2011term declines** (often <5\u202f% and lasting 6\u201112\u202fmonths) have been observed in a minority of U.S. city\u2011level programs, especially when the buyback is paired with intense media coverage and community\u2011policing initiatives.  \n* **Long\u2011term effects** are difficult to detect because most programs are episodic and the background trend in gun violence is driven by many other factors (economic conditions, policing policies, broader gun\u2011law changes, etc.).\n\n> **Consensus:** The mainstream public\u2011health literature treats voluntary gun\u2011buybacks as *low\u2011impact* tools for reducing firearms in circulation. They are not, on their own, a \u201csilver bullet\u201d for cutting homicide or suicide rates.\n\n### 2. Evidence from specific countries\n\n| Country / Program | Design | Main outcomes reported | Interpretation |\n|-------------------|--------|------------------------|----------------|\n| **Australia \u2013 1996 National Firearms Amnesty & 1997 \u201cBuy\u2011back\u201d** (mandatory surrender of semi\u2011automatic rifles & shotguns) | One\u2011time, government\u2011mandated, funded $1\u202fbillion, 650\u202fk firearms collected | **Firearm homicide fell from 0.26 to 0.15 per 100\u202fk (\u224840\u202f% drop)** in the first three years; firearm suicide fell ~30\u202f%; overall homicide (all weapons) fell ~10\u202f% | Because the program was *mandatory* and targeted a specific class of weapons, it is often cited as a success, but other concurrent reforms (licensing, background checks) make causal attribution uncertain. |\n| **United Kingdom \u2013 1997 \u201cFirearms Amnesty\u201d** (voluntary",

Some jurisdictions offer higher payouts for certain weapon types (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles, high\u2011capacity magazines). |\n| **Eligibility** | Any legally owned firearm, often with no background\u2011check requirement because the transaction is a \u201csurrender, not a purchase.\u201d |\u202fSome programs limit to handguns only, or to firearms that are not registered, or to \u201cunwanted\u201d firearms (owner\u2011declared). A few programs (e.g., \u201cmandatory amnesties\u201d) temporarily suspend penalties for turning in prohibited weapons. |\n| **Record\u2011keeping** | Usually a log of the make, model, caliber, and serial number (if present). Many U.S. programs do **not** require serial\u2011number reporting because many guns lack them. |\u202fIn Australia, New\u202fZealand, and several European countries, serial numbers are recorded and cross\u2011checked against registration databases. |\n| **Disposition of the guns** | Destroyed (shredded, melted, or otherwise rendered inoperable) or, less commonly, sold to collectors or museums after de\u2011classification. |\u202fSome U.S. programs have sold functional firearms at auction (e.g., \u201cPolice\u2011approved surplus guns\u201d) \u2013 a practice that is controversial because it can re\u2011introduce guns into the market. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.
