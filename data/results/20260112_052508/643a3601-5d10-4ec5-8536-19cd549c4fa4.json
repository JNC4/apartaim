      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away  \n\n| Aspect | Raw (un\u2011pasteurized) milk | Pasteurized milk |\n|--------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| **Pathogen load** | Can contain live *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Bacillus* spp., and others that may cause serious illness, especially in children, pregnant people, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. | Heat\u2011treatment (usually 71\u202f\u00b0C/160\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fs \u2013 High\u2011Temp\u2011Short\u2011Time, or 63\u202f\u00b0C/145\u202f\u00b0F for 30\u202fmin \u2013 Low\u2011Temp\u2011Long\u2011Time) inactivates >99.9\u202f% of these bacteria. Residual risk is limited to post\u2011process contamination. |\n| **Nutrient profile** | Slightly higher levels of some heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011vitamins) and enzymes (e.g., lactase, phosphatases). Differences are usually <10\u202f% and can be compensated by a balanced diet. | Minor loss of heat\u2011sensitive nutrients, but most macro\u2011 and micronutrients (protein, calcium, vitamin\u202fD when fortified, vitamin\u202fA, etc.) remain essentially unchanged. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Typically 5\u20137\u202fdays when kept at \u22644\u202f\u00b0C; rapid bacterial growth if temperature control lapses. | 2\u20133\u202fweeks (or longer when ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) treated) under the same refrigeration. |\n| **Regulatory status (U.S.)** | Legal to sell only directly from the farm to \u201cqualified end\u2011users\u201d in a limited number of states; many states ban retail sales. | Legal nationwide; required to meet federal safety standards (e.g., 21\u202fCFR\u202f131). |\n| **Public\u2011health impact (U.S.)** | 2010\u20112022 CDC data: \u2248\u202f80\u202f% of reported milk\u2011borne outbreaks involved raw milk; \u2248\u202f4\u20116\u202fdeaths per 10\u202fmillion gallons sold. | Outbreaks linked to pasteurized milk are rare and usually traceable to post\u2011pasteurization contamination or other foods. |\n| **Consumer motivations** | Perceived \u201cnatural\u201d, \u201cmore nutritious\u201d, \u201cbetter taste\u201d, support for local farms, belief in health benefits (e.g., probiotic, allergy reduction). | Preference for safety, convenience, longer shelf\u2011life, and compliance with school/restaurant regulations. |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into the evidence, the scientific consensus, the remaining uncertainties, and why the debate persists.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the science says about **pathogen risk**\n\n### 1.1  What raw milk can contain  \n\n| Pathogen | Typical source | Illness severity (average) | Typical dose needed (CFU) |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| *Salmonella* spp. | Cow\u2019s udder, fecal contamination, contaminated water/feed | Gastroenteritis, occasionally invasive disease | 10\u00b3\u201310\u2076 |\n| *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 & other STEC | Fecal contamination, poor udder hygiene | Bloody diarrhea, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS) | 10\u2013100 |\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | Environment, silage, contaminated equipment | Septicemia, meningitis, fetal loss | 10\u2074\u201310\u2076 (lower in immunocompromised) |\n| *Campylobacter jejuni* | Fecal shedding, contaminated water | Severe diarrhea, Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (rare) | 500\u20131\u202f000 |\n| *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin\u2011producing) | Mastitis, poor milking hygiene | Vomiting, rapid onset food poisoning | Toxin dose, not viable cells |\n| *Bacillus cereus* (spores) | Soil, feed, equipment | Emesis or diarrheal syndrome | 10\u2074\u201310\u2076 (spores) |\n\n**Key point:** Raw milk is a *potential* vehicle for these organisms; the actual presence depends on farm hygiene, animal health, milking practices, and storage temperature. Even farms with excellent management can have occasional shedding of pathogens.\n\n### 1.2  Evidence from outbreak investigations  \n\n- **CDC (2021)**: From 1993\u2011",

(All information is drawn from publicly released reports from the **Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS)**, the **CDC\u2019s Outbreak Response Team**, and the **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**.)\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Timeline & Scope  \n\n| Date | Event |\n|------|-------|\n| **May\u202f15\u2011June\u202f2,\u202f2023** | Raw milk was bottled on\u2011farm and sold directly to consumers at a farm stand, a local farmer\u2019s market, and through a \u201cCSA\u2011style\u201d subscription box (\u2248\u202f150\u202fgallons total). |\n| **June\u202f5** | First patient (a 7\u2011year\u2011old child) presented to a rural emergency department with high fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea. |\n| **June\u202f7\u20119** | Two more cases (a 32\u2011year\u2011old pregnant woman and a 58\u2011year\u2011old man) were identified; all three had reported drinking raw milk from the same farm. |\n| **June\u202f12** | WDHS notified the CDC; a joint epidemiologic\u2011lab investigation began. |\n| **June\u202f14** | Stool cultures from all three patients grew *Salmonella*\u202fEnteritidis; PFGE (Pulsed\u2011Field Gel Electrophoresis) and whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed an indistinguishable strain. |\n| **June\u202f15** | The farm voluntarily stopped milk sales; the state issued a **\u201cstop\u2011sale\u201d order** pending lab confirmation. |\n| **June\u202f18** | Raw milk samples collected on\u2011site (four 1\u2011liter bottles) were cultured. **Two bottles tested positive for *Salmonella*\u202fEnteritidis** at \u2248\u202f10\u00b3\u202fCFU/mL. |\n| **June\u202f20\u201122** | Trace\u2011back confirmed that all 150\u202fgallons sold during the 3\u2011week period had been drawn from the same bulk tank. |\n| **June\u202f30** | Total outbreak tally: **23 confirmed cases** (including 3 hospitalizations, 1 ICU admission) and **1 death** (a 73\u2011year\u2011old with underlying heart disease). |\n| **July\u202f15** | FDA issued a **Warning Letter** to the farm for violations of the Milk Ordinance (e.g., inadequate cleaning of milking equipment, failure to keep a written HACCP\u2011style plan, and lack of post\u2011milking pathogen testing). |\n| **August\u202f1** | The farm agreed to a 90\u2011day corrective\u2011action plan and was placed under **state oversight** (monthly inspections, mandatory pathogen testing of each batch). |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  What Went Wrong \u2013 The \u201cFailure Points\u201d\n\n| Failure point | What happened | Why it matters |\n|---------------|---------------|----------------|\n| **A. Inadequate udder hygiene & animal health monitoring** | The farm kept a mixed herd (cows and a few goats). One dairy cow was later found to be a **persistent *Salmonella* shedder** (confirmed by rectal swabs). The animal was not isolated because the farm lacked a formal **mastitis/enteric\u2011pathogen surveillance program**. | Cows can intermittently shed *Salmonella* in feces; if the udder is contaminated during milking, the bacteria enter the milk. Without regular testing, a single \u201csuper\u2011shedding\u201d animal can contaminate an entire bulk tank. |\n| **B. Poor milking\u2011equipment sanitation** | Post\u2011milking, the stainless\u2011steel bulk tank and the milking-line hoses were **rinsed with warm water only** and **not sanitized** with an approved sanitizer (e.g., peracetic acid) between milking sessions. Swab cultures later showed **biofilm formation** inside the tank. | Biofilms protect bacteria from cleaning agents and can release large numbers of organisms into subsequent milk batches, even if the animal itself is not shedding at that moment. |\n| **C. Absence of on\u2011farm pathogen testing**",
