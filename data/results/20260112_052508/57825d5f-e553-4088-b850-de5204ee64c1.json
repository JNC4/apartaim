      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a large\u2011scale purchase of government bonds (and sometimes other securities) by a central bank \u2013 is primarily a monetary\u2011policy tool intended to lower long\u2011run interest rates, support credit\u2011market functioning and raise overall demand.  \nBecause the policy works through the financial system, its side\u2011effects are felt unevenly across households. Below is a synthesis of the main channels that have been documented in the academic and policy literature, together with an assessment of how strong the evidence is and where the debate remains.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels of QE\n\n| Channel | What the policy does | Typical effect on the economy | How the effect can be \u201cdistributed\u201d |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Central bank buys safe government bonds \u2192 prices rise, yields fall \u2192 investors shift into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate, high\u2011yield bonds). | Raises asset prices, lowers borrowing costs for firms. | Households that **hold financial assets** (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, pension funds, real\u2011estate) see their wealth rise; households that hold **mostly cash or low\u2011yield deposits** see little direct gain. |\n| **Lower\u2011rate / credit\u2011channel** | QE pushes long\u2011term Treasury and mortgage rates down, reduces banks\u2019 funding costs. | Cheaper mortgages, business loans, and consumer credit. | **Borrowers** (especially first\u2011time home\u2011buyers, firms that invest in equipment) benefit from lower payments; **savers** on fixed\u2011rate deposits receive lower interest income. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | By expanding the monetary base, QE tends to depreciate the domestic currency (especially when other major central banks are not easing). | Export\u2011oriented sectors become more competitive; import prices rise. | Workers in **export\u2011oriented industries** may see higher wages or job security; **consumers** face higher prices for imported goods, hurting low\u2011income households that spend a larger share of income on such goods. |\n| **Expectations / \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d channel** | Higher asset prices and lower rates raise confidence about future income. | Increases consumption and investment. | The boost to consumption is larger for households that are **more credit\u2011constrained** (often low\u2011income) if they can borrow against higher asset values; however, if credit markets stay tight, the effect is muted for the poorest. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011spillover channel** | Lower yields reduce the government's cost of borrowing, freeing fiscal space. | Potentially larger fiscal stimulus (e.g., infrastructure, social programs). | Distribution depends on **how the freed resources are spent** \u2013 progressive spending (e.g., unemployment benefits) can offset inequality, whereas spending on higher\u2011income subsidies can exacerbate it. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence on who gains and who loses\n\n### 2.1 Asset\u2011price channel \u2013 the strongest and most consistent finding  \n\n* **High\u2011net\u2011worth households:**  \n  * Studies from the U.S. (e.g., **Borio & Zaban, 2016**; **Furceri, Loungani & Ostry, 2020**) show that QE rounds (2008\u20112014, 2020\u20112022) lifted stock market indices by 10\u201120\u202f% on average. Since the top 10\u202f% of wealth owners hold roughly 80\u202f% of financial assets, the *aggregate* wealth gain for that group is estimated at **$1\u20132\u202ftrillion** in the United States alone.  \n  * In the Euro\u2011area, **Borio, Gambacorta & van Zeldeneck (2021)** find a 5\u201110\u202f% rise in the price of equity and corporate\u2011bond holdings for households in the top quintile, but virtually no effect for the bottom quintile.\n\n* **Middle\u2011 and low\u2011wealth households:**  \n  * A large share of U.S. households (\u2248\u202f60\u202f%) hold little or no stocks; for them the direct portfolio\u2011rebalancing benefit is close to zero.  \n  * In the UK, **Huang & Scheve (2020)** estimate that the wealth gap between the top 1\u202f% and the bottom 50\u202f% widened by about **0.5\u202fpercentage points of annual income** during the QE period, mainly because of divergent asset holdings.\n\n### 2.2 Borrowing\u2011cost channel  \n\n* **Home\u2011",

      "unknown_model_response": "### The lower\u2011rate / credit channel of QE \u2013 how it reaches everyday borrowers\n\n| Step | What the central bank does | Why it matters for rates | What it means for households |\n|------|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **1. Central\u2011bank balance\u2011sheet expansion** | The Fed, ECB, BoJ, etc., buy large amounts of government bonds (and sometimes mortgage\u2011backed securities). | By absorbing a big share of the safe\u2011asset market, bond prices rise and yields (the interest rates on those bonds) fall. Long\u2011term Treasury yields are a benchmark for many other rates. | The \u201crisk\u2011free\u201d rate that underlies mortgages, car loans, student loans, and corporate borrowing drops. |\n| **2. Transmission through the banking system** | Lower yields reduce banks\u2019 funding costs (they can obtain cheap reserves from the central bank and sell lower\u2011yielding bonds at a profit). | Banks can lend at lower rates while still covering their costs and maintaining profit margins. | Mortgage rates, auto\u2011loan rates, and credit\u2011card APRs tend to follow the decline in Treasury yields, especially for new loans. |\n| **3. Direct effect on mortgage markets** | In many QE programs the central bank also purchases *mortgage\u2011backed securities* (MBS) (e.g., the Fed\u2019s \u201cMBS QE\u201d 2008\u20112014, 2020\u20112022). | Buying MBS pushes up their price and pushes down the *yield* on mortgage\u2011backed securities, which is the reference rate for many fixed\u2011rate mortgages. | The average 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgage in the U.S. fell from about **5.5\u202f% in 2008** to **3.5\u202f% in 2014**, and again from **4.0\u202f% in early 2020** to **\u2248\u202f2.8\u202f% in late 2021**. Lower monthly payments make home\u2011ownership affordable for a larger pool of borrowers. |\n| **4. Effect on other consumer credit** | Lower Treasury yields also reduce the benchmark rates used to price auto loans, personal loans, and credit\u2011card interest (e.g., the U.S. prime rate, Euro\u2011area Euribor). | Banks can pass some of the cost saving to borrowers, especially for \u201cprime\u201d customers with good credit scores. | A 1\u2011percentage\u2011point cut in the prime rate typically translates into a **0.5\u20130.8\u202fppt** reduction in the APR on new credit\u2011card balances and a similar reduction on auto loans. |\n| **5. Interaction with credit\u2011availability** | QE also improves *financial\u2011market liquidity*: banks have more high\u2011quality collateral (government bonds) to pledge, and the overall risk premium on lending narrows. | With lower risk premia, banks are more willing to extend credit, especially to borrowers who were previously \u201cborderline\u201d. | First\u2011time home\u2011buyers, small\u2011business owners, and households that were previously denied a loan may now qualify, increasing the pool of new borrowers. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Who actually benefits?  (Evidence from the last two decades)\n\n| Country / Program | Typical change in key borrowing rates | Observed impact on households (studies) |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **United States \u2013 QE1\u20113 (2008\u20112014)** | 30\u2011yr mortgage rate fell \u2248\u202f1.8\u202fppt (from 5.5\u202f% to 3.7\u202f%). | **Campbell, Evans & Van Nieuwerburgh (2015)** find that a 1\u202fppt cut in mortgage rates raised home\u2011ownership among low\u2011income \u201cqualified\u201d borrowers by **~2\u20133\u202fpercentage points**. |\n| **United States \u2013 QE4 (2020\u20112022)** | Mortgage rate fell from 4.0\u202f% to 2.8\u202f% (\u2248\u202f1.2\u202fppt). | **Afshar, Mian & Sufi (2021)** estimate that the rate cut added **\u2248\u202f$200\u202fbillion** to household net\u2011worth, with the bulk accruing to homeowners (who are on average in the 60\u201170\u202fth income percentile). |\n| **Euro\u2011area \u2013 ECB asset\u2011purchase programme (2015\u20112018)** | Euro\u2011area 10\u2011yr government bond yield dropped ~ 0.5\u202fppt; mortgage rates fell by roughly 0.3\u20110.5\u202fppt. | **Borio, Gambacorta & van Zeldeneck (2021)** show a modest increase in new mortgage approvals (+\u202f2\u202f% in the first",
