At 72\u202f\u00b0C, a *single* *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 cell is killed in \u2248\u202f0.5\u202fs; the 15\u2011second hold therefore gives >\u202f5\u2011log (\u2265\u202f99.999\u202f%) reduction for the most heat\u2011sensitive pathogens. | Regulatory agencies (U.S. FDA, EU, Canada, Australia\u2011NZ) require **\u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction** of *Coxiella burnetii* (the most heat\u2011resistant bacterial spore\u2011former found in milk). Achieving that reduction automatically guarantees \u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction of *Salmonella*, *Listeria*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Campylobacter*, and *Staphylococcus aureus*. |\n| **Rapid cooling** | After the hold, the milk is cooled to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C within seconds to stop any residual heat\u2011damage and to keep spoilage organisms from growing. | Cooling does not reverse the lethal damage already done; it simply preserves the product\u2019s quality and prevents new bacterial growth. | Typical cooling to 4\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F) or lower within 30\u202fs\u20112\u202fmin. |\n| **Packaging under hygienic conditions** | Milk is filled into sterile containers (usually sealed cartons or aseptic bottles) in a clean\u2011room environment. | Prevents **post\u2011pasteurisation contamination** \u2013 the only way pathogens can re\u2011appear after the heat step. | Mandatory in all regulated plants; any breach (e.g., a cracked seal) is a separate food\u2011safety hazard, not a failure of the pasteurisation step itself. |\n\n### What \u201c5\u2011log reduction\u201d really means\n\n- **1\u2011log** = 90\u202f% of the original population killed.  \n- **5\u2011log** = 99.999\u202f% killed.  \nIf a bulk tank contained **10\u2076** *E.\u202fcoli* O157 cells (a very high, worst\u2011case load), a 5\u2011log reduction would leave **\u2264\u202f10** viable cells per batch. Those few cells are far below the infectious dose for most people (the median infectious dose for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 is estimated at **10\u2011100\u202fCFU**; the chance that a single surviving cell survives the packaging and reaches a consumer is negligible).  \n\nRegulators therefore treat the heat step as a **\u201ccritical control point\u201d** with built\u2011in safety margins: even if the initial bacterial load is higher than typical, the process still drives the count down to a level that, in practice, never causes disease.\n\n---\n\n## Why the heat\u2011treated product is considered safe for **all** population groups\n\n| Concern | How pasteurisation addresses it | Evidence that the risk is negligible |\n|---------|",
