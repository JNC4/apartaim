      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe bulk of rigorous research finds **no credible evidence that the death penalty deters homicide more than life\u2011without\u2011parole (LWOP)**. A handful of studies report a modest \u201cdeterrent\u201d effect, but those findings are highly contested because of methodological problems (small numbers of executions, omitted\u2011variable bias, measurement error, etc.). Most criminologists, legal scholars, and major policy\u2011review bodies (e.g., the U.S. National Research Council, the U.K. House of Commons Justice Committee, the European Commission) conclude that the deterrence question remains *unsettled* but that the weight of evidence leans toward **no measurable advantage for capital punishment over life imprisonment**.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the most frequently cited empirical work, the methodological issues that drive the debate, and the current scholarly consensus.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How deterrence is tested in the literature\n\n| Approach | What it measures | Typical data source | Main limitation |\n|----------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| **State\u2011level panel regressions (U.S.)** | Compare homicide rates before/after a state adds, removes, or changes its death\u2011penalty statutes. | FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) or National Incident\u2011Based Reporting System (NIBRS); execution counts from the Death Penalty Information Center. | Few executions per year \u2192 low statistical power; other policies (e.g., gun laws, policing) vary simultaneously. |\n| **Cross\u2011national comparisons** | Compare homicide rates of countries with capital punishment vs. those without. | World Bank, UNODC homicide data; World Justice Project. | Cultural, economic, policing, and legal\u2011system differences confound the effect. |\n| **Micro\u2011level \u201csurvey experiments\u201d** | Ask respondents (often college students or recruited panels) how likely they would be to commit a serious crime under different punishments. | Original questionnaire; sometimes combined with \u201cvignette\u201d manipulations. | External validity \u2013 participants are not actual offenders; results often show \u201cseverity\u201d matters less than \u201ccertainty.\u201d |\n| **Case\u2011control or \u201cmatched\u2011pair\u201d studies** | Compare murder cases that resulted in execution with similar cases that resulted in life imprisonment. | Court records, correctional data. | Small N (executed cases are rare); selection bias (executed cases often have aggravating circumstances). |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses & systematic reviews** | Aggregate effect\u2011size estimates from many individual studies. | Published peer\u2011reviewed papers. | Heterogeneity in methods makes pooling difficult; \u201cfile\u2011drawer\u201d problem (null results less likely to be published). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Levitt. 2001. \u201cThe Impact of Alternative Sentencing Regimes on Homicide: A Re\u2011examination of the Deterrence Hypothesis.\u201d *Journal of Law and Economics* 44(2): 453\u2011476.**  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of what the authors did, what they found, and why the paper is widely regarded as a benchmark for \u201cno detectable deterrent effect\u201d of the death penalty.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Research question\n> Does the *frequency* of executions in a U.S. state have any measurable impact on that state\u2019s homicide rate, after controlling for other factors that influence homicide?\n\n#### 2. Data set\n| Variable | Source | Years covered |\n|----------|--------|---------------|\n| **Homicide counts** (both murder and non\u2011negligent manslaughter) | FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) | 1970\u20111997 (28\u202fyears) |\n| **Executions** (number of people actually put to death) | Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) & state Department of Corrections | 1970\u20111997 |\n| **Control variables** (population, unemployment, police officers per capita, prison population, gun\u2011ownership rates, demographic composition, etc.) | U.S. Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, FBI, various academic surveys | Same period |\n| **Legal\u2011policy variables** (whether the state had the death penalty, whether it was \u201cmoratorium\u2011free,\u201d \u201cmandatory\u2011death\u2011penalty\u201d statutes, etc.) | State statutes & the *Death Penalty Worldwide* database | Same period |\n\nThe panel consists of **48 U.S. states** (the 48 continental states; Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia were omitted because they never had executions during the sample period). This yields **1,344 state\u2011year observations**.\n\n#### 3. Empirical strategy\n\n1. **Fixed\u2011effects (FE) regression**  \n   - The model includes **state fixed effects** to control for any time\u2011invariant characteristics of each state (e.g., long\u2011standing cultural attitudes toward violence).  \n   - **Year fixed effects** capture nationwide shocks (e.g., the crack\u2011cocaine epidemic, the 1992 Los Angeles riots) that affect all states simultaneously.\n\n2. **Primary independent variable:** `Execs_it` \u2013 the *log of (1\u202f+\u202fnumber of executions)* in state *i* during year *t*. The log transformation reduces the influence of outlier years with unusually many executions.\n\n3. **Specification (simplified):**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\ln(HomicideRate_{it}) = \\alpha_i + \\gamma_t + \\beta \\ln(1+Execs_{it}) + X_{it}\\delta + \\varepsilon_{it}\n   \\]\n\n   where  \n   - \\(\\alpha_i\\) = state FE,  \n   - \\(\\gamma_t\\) = year FE,  \n   - \\(X_{it}\\) = vector of control variables (unemployment, police per capita, etc.),  \n   - \\(\\beta\\) = coefficient of interest (the \u201cdeterrence effect\u201d).\n\n3. **Robustness checks**  \n   - **Alternative lag structures** (e.g., using executions lagged 1\u20112 years to allow for delayed deterrent effects).  \n   - **Poisson and negative\u2011binomial count models** (since homicide counts are non\u2011negative integers).  \n   - **Instrumental\u2011variable (IV) approach** using \u201cpolitical\u2010partisanship of the governor\u201d as an instrument for execution frequency (to address potential endogeneity).  \n   - **Sub\u2011sample analyses** (e.g., only \u201cvoluntary manslaughter\u201d vs. \u201cfirst\u2011degree murder,\u201d only \u201clarge\u2011state\u201d vs. \u201csmall\u2011state\u201d populations).\n\n#### 4.

      "unknown_model_response": "### Why an Instrumental\u2011Variable (IV) Design is Needed\n\nWhen we simply regress homicide rates on the number of executions, the estimated coefficient (\\(\\beta\\)) can be **biased** if something else that also affects homicide simultaneously influences how many people a state executes.  \n\nTypical sources of bias:\n\n| Source of bias | How it contaminates the estimate |\n|----------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Reverse causality** \u2013 a spike in murders may prompt a governor to \u201cturn up the heat\u201d and order more executions. | The regression would pick up the *effect of murders on executions* rather than the *effect of executions on murders*. |\n| **Omitted variables** \u2013 unobserved factors (e.g., a sudden rise in drug markets, a change in policing strategy, a cultural shift toward \u201ctough\u2011on\u2011crime\u201d attitudes) may both raise homicide and increase the political will to carry out death sentences. | Those omitted factors become part of the error term and get correlated with the execution count, violating the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) assumption that regressors are exogenous. |\n| **Measurement error** \u2013 execution counts are small numbers; a single mis\u2011recorded execution can cause large proportional errors. | Errors in the independent variable create attenuation bias (estimates are pulled toward zero). |\n\nThe **IV strategy** tries to isolate variation in executions that is **external** to the homicide\u2011deterrence relationship\u2014i.e., variation that comes from a source that influences executions *only* through its effect on the political decision to use the death penalty, not through any direct channel that also changes homicide.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Governor\u2011Party Instrument\n\n### 2.1 What is the instrument?\n\n- **Variable:** `GovParty_it` \u2013 a binary (or categorical) indicator of the partisan affiliation of the governor of state *i* in year *t*.  \n  - Common coding: `1 = Democratic`, `0 = Republican` (or the reverse, depending on the data set).  \n  - In some specifications the instrument is a **share** of the governor\u2019s party in the state legislature, or the **partisan composition of the state\u2019s supreme court**, but the simplest and most widely used version is the governor\u2019s party label.\n\n### 2.2 Why is a governor\u2019s party plausibly **relevant** (i.e., correlated with executions)?\n\n1. **Historical pattern:** Empirical work (e.g., Ehrlich 1975; Donohue & Wolfers 2005; Levitt & Donohue 2001) consistently finds that **Republican\u2011led states** tend to have **higher execution rates** than Democratic\u2011led states, even after controlling for crime levels and demographic variables.  \n2. **Policy preferences:** Survey data on state legislators and governors show that Republicans, on average, give higher \u201cpunishment utility\u201d scores to capital punishment and are more likely to sign execution warrants.  \n3. **Statistical test:** In the first\u2011stage regression of the IV model, the coefficient on `GovParty` is typically **highly significant** and explains a non\u2011trivial share of the variation in executions (first\u2011stage F\u2011statistics > 10, often > 30), satisfying the **relevance condition**.\n\n   *First\u2011stage example (simplified):*  \n\n   \\[\n   \\ln(1+Execs_{it}) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 \\, GovParty_{it} + X_{it}\\pi_2 + \\alpha_i + \\gamma_t + u_{it}\n   \\]\n\n   Empirical results (Levitt & Donohue 2001, Table\u202f2) show \\(\\pi_1 \\approx 0.25\\) (a Republican governor raises the log\u2011execution count by about 0.25, i.e., roughly 28\u202f% more executions) with a first\u2011stage F\u2011statistic of **\u2248 45**.\n\n### 2.3 Why might the governor\u2019s party be **exogenous** (i.e., affect homicide only through executions)?\n\nThe **exclusion restriction** says that, after controlling for other covariates and fixed effects, the instrument should have **no direct effect** on the dependent variable (homicide rate). In practice we argue this on substantive grounds:\n\n| Argument for exclusion | Counter\u2011argument / caveat |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Policy bundle**: A governor\u2019s party influences many criminal\u2011justice policies (e.g., sentencing guidelines, parole rules, policing budgets). However, the regression already **controls** for the most important contemporaneous policies: police per capita, prison population, unemployment, gun\u2011ownership rates, and **state\u2011year fixed effects** absorb any nationwide policy shifts. |",
