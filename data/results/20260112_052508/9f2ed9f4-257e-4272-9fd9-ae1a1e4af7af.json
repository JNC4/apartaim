      "unknown_model_response": "**Why doctors (and most public\u2011health agencies) recommend vaccinating children**\n\n| Reason | What it means in practice | Why it matters for children and the community |\n|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Prevention of serious disease** | Vaccines protect against infections that can cause meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis, severe pneumonia, organ failure, or death (e.g., measles, diphtheria, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb, rotavirus). | Most of these illnesses are now rare in countries with high vaccine coverage, precisely because the vaccines work. When coverage drops, outbreaks re\u2011appear (e.g., measles resurges in areas with <\u202f95\u202f% coverage). |\n| **Reduction of complications and long\u2011term sequelae** | Even \u201cmild\u201d infections can leave lasting damage \u2013 e.g., hearing loss from measles, permanent tooth loss from diphtheria, developmental delays from congenital rubella, or chronic lung disease after severe RSV\u2011like infections. | Preventing the infection eliminates the risk of these downstream health problems, which can be costly and diminish quality of life. |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | When enough people are immune, the pathogen has few susceptible hosts and transmission chains break. For highly contagious diseases (e.g., measles) the threshold is \u2248\u202f95\u202f% of the population. | Children who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants too young, immunocompromised kids, those with certain medical conditions) are protected indirectly. |\n| **Economic and social benefits** | Fewer doctor visits, hospitalizations, and parental work\u2011days lost; lower health\u2011care costs (U.S. CDC estimates >\u202f$13\u202fbillion saved annually in the U.S. by childhood immunizations). | Families can keep children in school and daycare, reducing disruption and supporting normal development. |\n| **Global disease eradication/ control** | Smallpox eradicated, polio close to eradication, rubella eliminated in many regions. | Continuing vaccination maintains these gains; lapses can undo decades of progress. |\n| **Safety and regulatory oversight** | All vaccines used in routine childhood schedules have passed phase\u2011I\u2013III clinical trials and undergo continuous post\u2011licensure monitoring. | Doctors trust that the benefit\u2011to\u2011risk ratio is overwhelmingly positive, based on decades of data. |\n\n---\n\n### How safe are the vaccines?\n\n| Aspect | What the data show | How doctors interpret it |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Pre\u2011licensure testing** | Each vaccine (or combination vaccine) goes through: <br>\u2022 *Phase\u202fI*: small safety & dosage studies <br>\u2022 *Phase\u202fII*: larger groups for side\u2011effect profile <br>\u2022 *Phase\u202fIII*: \u2265\u202f2\u202f000\u20135\u202f000 participants, randomized, blinded, compared to placebo or active control. <br>Regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA, WHO Pre\u2011qualification, etc.) must see a clear benefit\u2011to\u2011risk balance before approval. | The \u201cclinical trial\u201d stage already screens out major safety problems. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure surveillance** | \u2022 **VAERS** (U.S.) \u2013 passive reporting system (anyone can submit).
