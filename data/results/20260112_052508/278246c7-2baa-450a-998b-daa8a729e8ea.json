Within five years, reported cases fell by roughly **75\u202f%** (from 450,000 to 115,000).  \n   - By the early 1980s\u2014after the combined measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR) vaccine became routine\u2014annual cases were **under 5\u202f%** of the pre\u2011vaccine level.\n\n2. **Sustained Low Levels With High Coverage**  \n   - When \u2265\u202f95\u202f% of children receive two doses of MMR, measles transmission is effectively interrupted in the community.  \n   - The United States has maintained **<\u202f100 cases per year** for most of the past three decades, a reduction of **>\u202f99.9\u202f%** compared with the pre\u2011vaccine era.\n\n3. **Impact on Severe Outcomes**  \n   - **Hospitalizations:** Prior to vaccination, measles caused ~\u202f48,000 hospital admissions annually in the U.S.; today, that number is typically **under 50** per year.  \n   - **Deaths:** Before the vaccine, measles claimed **\u2248\u202f400\u2013500 lives each year**; in the vaccine era, deaths are **rare (often zero)**, with only occasional fatalities linked to imported cases.\n\n#### Why the decline matters\n\n- **Herd immunity:** With >\u202f95\u202f% coverage, the virus finds it extremely difficult to find susceptible hosts, protecting infants too young to be vaccinated and individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.  \n- **Economic savings:** The CDC estimates that each measles case averted saves **\u2248\u202f$2,500\u2013$3,000** in direct medical costs and **\u2248\u202f$10,000\u2013$15,000** when productivity losses are included.  \n- **Prevention of complications:** Measles can cause encephalitis, pneumonia, and long\u2011term neurological damage. The vaccine has virtually eliminated these severe sequelae in the U.S.\n\n### Bottom line\nThe introduction of the measles vaccine\u2014and its incorporation into the routine two\u2011dose MMR schedule\u2014has turned a disease that once infected **hundreds of thousands** of children each year into a **rare, travel\u2011associated illness**. The quantitative drop\u2014from **\u2248\u202f450,000 cases in 1963** to **single\u2011digit annual numbers** in the 21st\u202fcentury\u2014demonstrates the profound public\u2011health benefit of childhood vaccination.",
