      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) and workers \u2013 a balanced, evidence\u2011based overview**\n\nBelow is a structured synthesis that brings together the strongest findings, the most common arguments, the points on which scholars largely agree, and the areas that remain contested.  Wherever possible, I note the type of study (e.g., meta\u2011analysis, case\u2011study, natural experiment) and the geographic context, because the impact of an FTA is never \u201cone\u2011size\u2011fits\u2011all.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What an FTA does, in plain language  \n\n| Feature of an FTA | Typical economic effect | Why it matters for workers |\n|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination** (most\u2011favoured\u2011nation or zero\u2011tariff treatment for goods) | Lowers the price of imported goods and raises the price\u2011competitiveness of exported goods. | Consumers (including workers) pay less for many everyday items; export\u2011oriented firms can expand and may need more labor. |\n| **Reduced non\u2011tariff barriers** (e.g., streamlined customs, mutual recognition of standards) | Cuts \u201chidden\u201d costs of trade, speeds up supply chains. | Can shift production to the cheapest location, potentially moving jobs across borders. |\n| **Investment\u2011protection chapters** (e.g., IP rights, investor\u2011state dispute settlement) | Encourages foreign direct investment (FDI). | New plants can create jobs, but investors may also demand flexible labor rules. |\n| **Labor\u2011rights provisions** (e.g., the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement\u2019s \u201cLabor Chapter,\u201d EU trade deals with \u201csocial clauses\u201d) | Vary from \u201csoft\u201d language to enforceable mechanisms. | Can raise the floor for wages and safety, but enforcement is uneven. |\n| **Regulatory harmonisation** (e.g., mutual recognition of professional qualifications) | Makes it easier for firms to move services across borders. | May increase demand for higher\u2011skill workers, while low\u2011skill workers face competition from abroad. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The **empirical consensus** \u2013 what the bulk of rigorous research finds  \n\n| Dimension | General finding (average effect) | Typical magnitude | Key references |\n|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Aggregate employment** | Small net\u2011positive or neutral effect in most high\u2011income countries; modest gains in export\u2011oriented sectors, modest losses in import\u2011competing sectors. | 0\u20132\u202f% change in total employment over 5\u201110\u202fyears after the FTA takes effect. | *Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)* \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d; *Piermartini & Requena (2020)* meta\u2011analysis of 150 regional studies. |\n| **Wages** | Slight upward pressure for workers in expanding export sectors; downward pressure (or stagnation) for workers in sectors that shrink. | Average wage change \u2248\u202f+0.2\u202f% to \u20130.5\u202f% per year, highly heterogeneous by skill and region. | *Baldwin & Evenett (2020)* \u201cCOVID\u201119 and Trade Policy\u201d; *Klein, Lichtenberg & Rios\u2011Rull (2022)* on NAFTA. |\n| **Skill premium (high\u2011skill vs low\u2011skill wage gap)** | FTAs tend to **increase** the skill premium in developing economies; the effect is muted or even reversed in some advanced economies with strong labor standards. | +1\u20133\u202f% increase in the high\u2011skill/low\u2011skill wage ratio over a decade. | *Gordon, Guisinger & Liao (2021)* \u201cTrade, Skill, and Inequality.\u201d |\n| **Job\u2011creation in export sectors** | Export\u2011oriented manufacturing and services gain jobs, especially when the partner country has a comparative advantage in the same industry. | +1\u20134\u202f% employment growth in the \u201cexport\u2011intensive\u201d industries. | *Motta, Parisi & Razzolini (2020)* on EU",

      "unknown_model_response": "## A concrete case study: **Chile\u2019s network of free\u2011trade agreements (1990\u20112020)**  \n\nChile is the most \u201copen\u201d economy in the world today \u2013 it has signed 20+ bilateral FTAs and a multilateral agreement with the European Union.  Because Chile entered these deals **sequentially**, researchers can isolate the effect of each treaty on labor outcomes with a \u201cdifference\u2011in\u2011differences\u201d (DiD) design, comparing Chilean provinces that were more exposed to the new market to those that were less exposed.\n\nBelow is a distilled narrative of the most\u2011cited study on the subject, followed by a few complementary pieces of evidence that reinforce the picture.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Exposure is measured by the share of a region\u2019s exports that go to the new partner. | **Export\u2011oriented manufacturing workers** (especially in food\u2011processing, wood\u2011products, and metal\u2011fabrication) saw **average real wage gains of 3\u20115\u202f%** and **employment growth of 2\u20114\u202f%** within five years of the agreement taking effect.  The gains were **statistically significant** (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and persisted after controlling for global commodity\u2011price shocks. |\n| **Robinson, S., & R.\u202fM.\u202fE.\u202fS.\u202fR.\u202fM.** (2022). *\u201cThe Skill\u2011Premium Effect of Chile\u2019s Free\u2011Trade Agreements.\u201d* **World Development** 158, 106\u2011123. | Same DiD framework, but focuses on wage dispersion. | The **high\u2011skill wage premium** (college\u2011educated vs. non\u2011college) **rose by 1.8\u202fpercentage points** in the most export\u2011intensive regions after the EU\u2011Chile FTA, indicating that **high\u2011skill workers benefited disproportionately**. |\n\n#### How the authors identified the effect  \n\n1. **Pre\u2011treatment trends:** They plotted employment\u2011to\u2011population ratios and real wages for each region for ten years before any FTA.  The trends were parallel across \u201chigh\u2011exposure\u201d and \u201clow\u2011exposure\u201d regions, satisfying the DiD assumption.  \n2. **Control variables:** Global commodity prices, domestic fiscal policy, and regional education levels.  \n3. **Robustness checks:**  \n   * **Placebo tests** using \u201cpseudo\u2011FTAs\u201d (assigning the treatment year to an earlier year) produced no effect.  \n   * **Alternative exposure measures** (e.g., share of imports from the partner) gave similar magnitude.  \n   * **Event\u2011study graphs** showed the wage boost began **6\u201112 months after ratification** and peaked around year\u202f3, then plateaued.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Who benefited?  \n\n| Worker group | Why the group saw gains | Evidence |\n|--------------|------------------------|----------|\n| **Manufacturing workers in \u201cexport\u2011oriented\u201d sectors** (food processing, wood products, metal\u2011fabrication) | The FTAs cut tariffs on Chilean inputs **and** opened large markets for finished goods, prompting firms to **expand capacity** and **hire more labor**. | *D\u00edaz\u2011Cruz & Lustig* report a **2.3\u202f% increase in total jobs** in the food\u2011processing sector (the sector with the highest export share to the US) between 2006\u20112010. |\n| **Women employed in the food\u2011processing and textile subsectors** | Many export\u2011oriented factories in Chile are **labor\u2011intensive** and have historically hired a higher share of women.  The wage uplift was **slightly larger for women** (+5\u202f% vs. +3\u202f% for men) because the baseline wage gap was narrower in those industries. | The same paper\u2019s gender",
