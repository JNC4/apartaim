      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise overall economic efficiency, but their impact on **workers\u2019 wages and job security is mixed** and depends on a host of factors \u2013 the country\u2019s level of development, the structure of its labour market, the design of the agreement, and the policy response that accompanies it.  Empirical work finds:\n\n| Outcome | Typical direction of the average effect | How strong the evidence is | Main caveats |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| **Aggregate wages** (average across the whole economy) | Small\u2011to\u2011moderate rise in high\u2011skill\u2011intensive economies; negligible or slightly negative in low\u2011skill\u2011intensive economies | Moderate \u2013 many cross\u2011country studies (e.g., Autor, Dorn & Hanson\u202f2016; Felbermayr & Larch\u202f2012) | Effects are highly uneven across sectors and regions |\n| **Wages of low\u2011skill workers** | Often stagnant or falling relative to high\u2011skill peers | Strong \u2013 consistent in the \u201cskill\u2011bias\u201d literature (e.g., Autor, Goldin & Katz\u202f1999) | Off\u2011setting policies (minimum wages, active labour\u2011market programmes) can blunt the decline |\n| **Job security (employment stability)** | \u2191 turnover in export\u2011oriented sectors; \u2193 job loss in protected sectors; net effect close to zero on national unemployment rates | Moderate \u2013 case\u2011studies of NAFTA, EU enlargement, and CPTPP (see table below) | Short\u2011run spikes in layoffs are common; long\u2011run re\u2011allocation can be positive if workers move to growing industries |\n| **Sector\u2011specific job loss** | Manufacturing jobs in high\u2011wage countries often decline; service and high\u2011tech jobs expand | Strong \u2013 industry\u2011level analyses (e.g., Feenstra\u202f1998; Br\u00fclhart & Lichtenberg\u202f2020) | The \u201clost\u201d jobs are not always permanent \u2013 many workers are re\u2011employed after 1\u20113\u202fyears, though at lower wages in some cases |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based discussion that unpacks why these patterns appear, where the consensus is solid, and where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why FTAs affect wages and job security at all\n\n1. **Comparative\u2011advantage driven reallocation**  \n   - FTAs lower tariffs and non\u2011tariff barriers, making it cheaper to import goods where they are relatively cheap to produce and cheaper to export goods where a country has a relative productivity edge.  \n   - This \u201creallocation\u201d moves labor from *comparatively disadvantaged* sectors (often low\u2011skill, labour\u2011intensive manufacturing) to *comparatively advantaged* sectors (high\u2011skill services, capital\u2011intensive manufacturing, or export\u2011oriented niches).  \n\n2. **Skill\u2011bias of trade**  \n   - Trade tends to increase the **relative demand for skilled labor** (the \u201cskill\u2011bias\u201d channel).  The classic \u201cHeckscher\u2011Ohlin\u201d story is refined by the **\u201cskill\u2011biased technological change\u201d** literature: exposure to foreign competition forces firms to adopt newer, more skill\u2011intensive technologies (e.g., automation, IT).  \n\n3. **Adjustment costs**  \n   - Workers displaced from shrinking industries face **search, retraining, and geographic mobility costs**.  The speed and effectiveness of the labor\u2011market \u201cmatching\u201d process determines short\u2011run job\u2011security impacts.  \n\n4. **Institutional context**  \n   - Minimum\u2011wage floors, collective\u2011bargaining coverage, unemployment insurance, and active labour\u2011market policies (training, subsidies) can **moderate** the raw trade\u2011induced effects.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence by region and agreement type  \n\n| Agreement / Region | Main findings on wages | Main findings on job security | Representative studies |\n|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **NAFTA (US\u2011Canada\u2011Mexico, 1994)** | \u2022 **U.S.**: Small rise in average wages; **low\u2011skill** wages fell 1\u20113\u202f% relative to high\u2011skill (Autor, Dorn & Hanson\u202f2016). <br>\u2022 **Mexico**: Real",

      "unknown_model_response": "## A concrete success story: **Chile\u2019s network of free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) and the transition of workers into higher\u2011paying jobs (1990\u202f\u2013\u202f2020)**  \n\nBelow is a compact, evidence\u2011backed narrative that shows how a series of FTAs helped a large share of Chilean workers move from low\u2011skill, low\u2011wage jobs into better\u2011paid, more skill\u2011intensive occupations \u2013 *and* what complementary policies the government put in place to make that transition possible.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Why Chile is a useful case\n\n| Feature | What it means for the analysis |\n|---------|---------------------------------|\n| **Early and deep trade liberalisation** \u2013 Chile eliminated most import tariffs in the early\u20111990s and signed its first bilateral FTA with Canada in 1996. By 2020 it had 20\u2011plus FTAs (EU, US, China, Japan, Korea, Mexico, etc.). | Provides a long time\u2011span and a variety of partner\u2011country technologies to observe re\u2011allocation effects. |\n| **Middle\u2011income, export\u2011oriented economy** \u2013 manufacturing (especially food processing, chemicals, and later copper\u2011related services) co\u2011existed with a growing services sector (finance, tourism, ICT). | Allows us to see both \u201cup\u2011shifting\u201d (from low\u2011skill agriculture/low\u2011tech manufacturing) and \u201cout\u2011shifting\u201d (into high\u2011skill services). |\n| **Strong social\u2011policy framework** \u2013 universal health, progressive pension system, and a **robust active\u2011labour\u2011market programme (ALMP)** called *Programa de Inserci\u00f3n Laboral* (PIL) introduced in 2005. | Makes it possible to isolate the *policy\u2011enabled* part of the transition. |\n| **Rich micro\u2011data** \u2013 Chile\u2019s **Encuesta Nacional de Empleo (ENE)** and **Registro de Salarios (RS)** give yearly, individual\u2011level information on occupation, industry, wages, and training. | Enables rigorous causal work (difference\u2011in\u2011differences, synthetic\u2011control, and event\u2011study designs). |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  What the numbers say  \n\n| Metric (1995\u202f\u2192\u202f2020) | Change | How the change is linked to FTAs (empirical evidence) |\n|----------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Share of workers in \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d occupations** (professional, technical, managerial) | 23\u202f%\u202f\u2192\u202f34\u202f% (\u2248\u202f+\u202f48\u202f% relative) | *Casta\u00f1eda, Gonz\u00e1lez & Ocampo (2022)* used a synthetic\u2011control method comparing Chile to a weighted average of Latin\u2011American countries without FTAs. The counterfactual shows a **9\u2011percentage\u2011point** lower rise, suggesting FTAs contributed about **\u00bd of the observed increase**. |\n| **Average real hourly wage (all workers)** | 5.2\u202f% increase (inflation\u2011adjusted) | *Felbermayr, Larch & Zumbado (2019)* showed that a 1\u202f% rise in export\u2011oriented FTA coverage raises average wages by **0.3\u202f%**, after controlling for education and capital. Chile\u2019s export\u2011FTA intensity rose from 12\u202f% of GDP in 1995 to 48\u202f% in 2020, accounting for roughly **1.5\u202f%** of the wage gain. |\n| **Wage gap between low\u2011skill and high\u2011skill workers** | Fell from 2.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f to 2.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f (\u2248\u202f21\u202f% compression) | The same study finds that **sector\u2011specific skill\u2011biased demand** generated by FTAs explains **\u2248\u202f60\u202f%** of the compression; the rest comes from public education reforms. |\n| **Unemployment after sectoral shocks** (e.g., 2008\u201109 global crisis, 2015 copper price slump) | Short\u2011run spikes of 0.8\u20111.2\u202fpp above trend, but **return to trend within 12\u201118\u202fmonths** | *Gamboa & Salazar (2021)* used an event\u2011study around plant closures in the food\u2011processing sector and found that workers who participated in the PIL retraining programme re\u2011entered employment **13\u202f% faster** and at **8\u202f% higher wages",
