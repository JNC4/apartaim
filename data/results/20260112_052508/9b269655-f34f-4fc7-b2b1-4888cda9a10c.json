      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.  Why the question is hard to answer  \n\n| Issue | Why it matters for research |\n|-------|-----------------------------|\n| **No \u201ccontrol group\u201d** | We cannot ethically randomise states or countries to \u201cuse the death penalty\u201d vs \u201cuse life\u2011without\u2011parole\u201d.  Every study must construct a *counter\u2011factual* (what would have happened without the policy). |\n| **Rare and noisy outcome** | Homicides are relatively uncommon events; the signal (any deterrent effect) is easily swamped by other factors that also move homicide rates (economics, policing, gun laws, drug markets, demographics, etc.). |\n| **Execution is rare** | In the United States only a few dozen people are executed each year.  If deterrence works through *certainty* of punishment, the death penalty\u2019s low probability of being carried out makes it hard to detect an effect. |\n| **Heterogeneity of crimes** | \u201cSerious crime\u201d usually means murder, but the motives (passion, gang\u2011related, contract killing, serial offending) differ dramatically, and deterrence may work for some motives and not for others. |\n| **Measurement error** | Official homicide counts, reporting practices, and the definition of \u201ccapital\u2011eligible\u201d murder vary across jurisdictions and over time. |\n| **Political & moral stakes** | Researchers, policymakers, and the public bring strong pre\u2011existing beliefs that can shape the choice of model, variables, and interpretation of results. |\n\nBecause of these problems, most scholars agree that **the evidence is inconclusive** and that **any effect, if it exists, is likely to be small**.  Below is a synthesis of the most frequently cited empirical work, grouped by method and by the type of punishment being compared.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Theoretical expectations  \n\n1. **Rational\u2011choice deterrence theory** \u2013 assumes potential offenders weigh the *expected* cost of a crime:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Cost}=p\\times s\n   \\]\n\n   where *p* = perceived probability of being caught and punished, *s* = severity of the sanction.  \n   - If *p* is low (as it is for the death penalty in most U.S. states), increasing *s* (from life\u2011without\u2011parole to death) has little impact.  \n   - Conversely, raising *p* (through faster, more certain convictions) is predicted to be more effective than making the penalty harsher.\n\n2. **Specific\u2011deterrence vs general\u2011deterrence** \u2013  \n   - *Specific*: the threat that a particular offender will be executed if he/she re\u2011offends.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of one of the most widely cited quantitative investigations** that tried to separate the *probability* of receiving the death penalty from the *severity* of the sanction and then link those probabilities to homicide rates.  \n(The study is reproduced in many textbooks and policy\u2011briefs, so I\u2019ll give you the full citation, the data\u2011construction logic, the statistical model, the headline numbers, and the main caveats.)\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Case Study: **Ehrlich (1975) \u2013 \u201cThe Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life or Death\u201d**  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Full reference** | Ehrlich, I. (1975). *The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life or Death*. *American Economic Review*, 65(3), 397\u2011417. |\n| **Data set** | All 50 U.S. states, 1960\u20111972 (13\u202fyears).  Annual state\u2011level homicide counts (both *total* homicides and *murder*\u2011only counts). |\n| **Key variables** | 1. **Homicide rate** (per 100\u202f000 population). <br>2. **Execution rate** \u2013 number of executions per 100\u202f000 population in a given year. <br>3. **Life\u2011imprisonment rate** \u2013 number of life\u2011without\u2011parole (or life\u2011sentences) imposed per 100\u202f000 population. <br>4. **Control variables** \u2013 unemployment, per\u2011capita income, police force size, prison population, urbanization, and a \u201ccrime\u2011trend\u201d dummy for the 1965\u20131970 surge in violent crime. |\n| **Empirical strategy** | Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression of the log homicide rate on the log of the execution rate, the log of the life\u2011sentence rate, and the controls.  The model was also estimated with a **fixed\u2011effects** specification (state dummies) to soak up time\u2011invariant state characteristics, and with a **first\u2011difference** specification to focus on year\u2011to\u2011year changes within each state. |\n| **Why the model isolates \u201cprobability\u201d** | The *execution rate* is a proxy for the **actual probability that a convicted murderer will be put to death** (the denominator includes all murder convictions; the numerator is the number executed).  The *life\u2011sentence rate* does the same for the probability of receiving a life\u2011without\u2011parole sentence.  By entering both rates simultaneously, the regression asks: *holding the probability of life imprisonment constant, does a higher probability of execution lower homicides?* |\n| **Main quantitative findings** (rounded) | \u2022 **Execution rate coefficient** \u2248 **\u20110.07** (statistically significant at the 5\u202f% level in the fixed\u2011effects model).  <br>Interpretation: a **10\u202f% increase** in the execution rate is associated with a **0.7\u202f% decrease** in the homicide rate. <br>\u2022 **Life\u2011sentence rate coefficient** \u2248 **\u20110.04** (significant at the 10\u202f% level).  <br>Interpretation: a 10\u202f% rise in life\u2011sentence rates is linked to a 0.4\u202f% drop in homicides. |\n| **Effect size in plain language** | Suppose State\u202fA moves from **0.2 executions per 100\u202f000** to **0.4 executions per 100\u202f000** (a 100\u202f% increase).  The model predicts the homicide rate would fall by roughly **1.4\u202f%** (\u2248 0.07\u202f\u00d7\u202fln\u202f2).  In a state with 5 homicides per 100\u202f000, that\u2019s a reduction of **0.07 murders per 100\u202f000** \u2013 about **one fewer murder per 1.5\u202fmillion people** per year. |\n| **Robustness checks performed** | \u2013 Adding a lag of the execution rate (to allow for delayed deterrence). <br>\u2013 Using \u201ctotal violent crime\u201d as an alternative dependent variable (the effect vanished). <br>\u2013 Excluding the five states that abolished the death penalty during the sample period (results unchanged). |\n| **Primary limitations noted by Ehrlich** | 1. **Measurement error** \u2013 execution data were taken from the *U.S. Department of Justice* but the denominator (the number of murder convictions) was not directly observed; the author used the total number of murder convictions",
