      "unknown_model_response": "**How scientists decide whether a genetically\u2011modified (GM) food is safe for humans**\n\nThe safety assessment of a GM food is a step\u2011by\u2011step process that combines\u202f*knowledge of the biology of the crop and the inserted gene*\u202fwith\u202f*standard toxicology, nutrition and allergenicity tests*\u202fthat are also used for any new food.  The work is done by the developers of the product, reviewed by independent scientists, and finally authorized (or rejected) by national or international regulatory agencies.  \nBelow is a roadmap of the typical evaluation, the evidence that underpins each step, and where genuine uncertainty or debate still exists.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Molecular and Genetic Characterisation  \n\n| What is examined | Why it matters | Typical methods |\n|------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Identity of the inserted DNA** (gene, promoter, terminator, any selectable marker) | Guarantees we know exactly what new protein(s) the plant will make. | DNA sequencing, Southern blot, PCR mapping. |\n| **Copy\u2011number and insertion site(s)** | Determines whether the new DNA disrupted an existing plant gene that could affect nutrition or produce an unintended toxin. | Whole\u2011genome sequencing, junction\u2011PCR, optical mapping. |\n| **Stability of the insertion** | Checks that the gene does not rearrange or mutate over successive generations. | Multi\u2011generation breeding studies, sequencing of later generations. |\n| **Expression level of the new protein(s)** | Quantifies how much of the novel protein is present in edible tissues. | ELISA, mass\u2011spectrometry, Western blot. |\n\n*Consensus*: Modern molecular tools can map a transgene with base\u2011pair precision. No credible evidence shows that the insertion process itself creates hazardous \u201chidden\u201d changes that escape detection.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Comparative (Compositional) Analysis  \n\n- **What is done?** The GM crop is grown side\u2011by\u2011side with a non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic control (the same variety without the transgene) under the same agronomic conditions. Researchers then measure:\n  - Macro\u2011nutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber)\n  - Micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals)\n  - Anti\u2011nutrients (e.g., oxalates, phytic acid)\n  - Known natural toxins (e.g., glycoalkaloids in potatoes)\n- **Why?** To see whether the GM version falls within the natural variation already observed for that species.  \n- **Evidence**: Hundreds of comparative studies (e.g., for Bt corn, Golden Rice, soybean\u00a0HB4) have shown that compositional differences, when they exist, are always within the range found in conventional varieties.\n\n*Uncertainty*: Small compositional shifts can sometimes be detected (e.g., a modest increase in a specific amino acid). Regulators require a scientific justification that the shift does not affect safety or nutrition. The debate is rarely about the existence of a shift, but about the interpretation of its relevance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Toxicology Assessment  \n\n### 3.1. **Protein\u2011specific toxicity testing**\n- **Acute oral toxicity** (e.g., LD\u2085\u2080 in rodents) \u2013 seldom needed if the protein is already known to be safe (most GM crops use proteins derived from *Bacillus thuringiensis* or from the plant itself).  \n- **Sub\u2011chronic (90\u2011day) feeding studies** \u2013 the GM food (or purified protein) is fed to rodents at several times the expected human intake. Endpoints include weight gain, organ pathology, blood chemistry, and histopathology.\n\n### 3.2. **Whole\u2011food animal studies**\n- The entire edible portion (e.g., corn kernels, soybeans) is incorporated into a diet at 30\u202f%\u2013",

The gene encodes the Cry1Ab protein, which is toxic to several lepidopteran pests (e.g., European corn borer) but has no known activity against mammals. |\n| **Regulatory context** | MON\u202f810 was the first GM food approved in the European Union (EU) (1998) and has been evaluated repeatedly by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). All three agencies concluded that the crop is safe for human consumption. |\n| **90\u2011day sub\u2011chronic feeding study** | **Reference:** *\u201cSub\u2011chronic (90\u2011day) oral toxicity study of MON\u202f810 maize in rats\u201d* \u2013 EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (EFSA\u2011GMO), 2004 (also published as an OECD Guideline\u2011compliant study in *Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology*). |\n| **Study design** | \u2022 **Test animals:** 80 Sprague\u2011Dawley rats (40\u202fmales, 40\u202ffemales) divided into 4 groups (10\u202fmales\u202f+\u202f10\u202ffemales per group). <br>\u2022 **Diets:** <br>\u2003\u2013 **Control diet:** 30\u202f% (w/w) conventional near\u2011isogenic maize (same genetic background, no transgene). <br>\u2003\u2013 **Test diet:** 30\u202f% (w/w) MON\u202f810 maize, grown under the same agronomic conditions as the control. <br>\u2003\u2013 Two additional control groups received the same diet with a known non\u2011toxic reference protein (casein) to confirm the assay\u2019s sensitivity. <br>\u2022 **Duration:** 90\u202fdays (continuous ad libitum feeding). <br>\u2022 **Endpoints measured:** body weight, food consumption, clinical observations, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, and detailed histopathology of 33 organs/tissues. |\n| **Key results** | 1. **Growth & food intake** \u2013 No statistically significant differences between the MON\u202f810 and control groups in body\u2011weight gain or daily food consumption. <br>2. **Clinical observations** \u2013 No treatment\u2011related signs of toxicity, morbidity, or mortality. <br>3. **Haematology & clinical chemistry** \u2013 All parameters (e.g., red\u2011blood\u2011cell count, ALT, creatinine, glucose) fell within normal physiological ranges for the strain and age of rats; any isolated statistical differences were small, lacked dose\u2011response, and were also seen in the reference\u2011protein control groups. <br>4. **Organ weights** \u2013 No statistically or biologically significant changes after correcting for body weight. <br>5. **Histopathology** \u2013 Microscopic examination of all examined tissues revealed only incidental background lesions typical for laboratory rats; no lesions were attributed to the GM diet. |\n| **Conclusion drawn by the investigators** | The 90\u2011day feeding study **did not reveal any adverse effects** that could be linked to consumption of MON\u202f810 maize.

The gene encodes a version of the enzyme 5\u2011enol\u2011pyruvylshikimate\u20113\u2011phosphate synthase (EPSPS) that is **insensitive to the herbicide glyphosate**. The protein is expressed throughout the plant, including the seeds that are eaten or processed into oil, meal, tofu, soy\u2011milk, etc. |\n| **Regulatory context** | GTS\u202f40\u20113\u20112 was the first herbicide\u2011tolerant GM crop approved for food in the United States (1996) and later in many other jurisdictions (EU, Canada, Japan, Australia, etc.). The safety dossier was reviewed by the U.S. FDA, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and the Australian Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR).

No lesions could be linked to the GM diet. |\n| **Interpretation by the authors** | The investigators concluded that \u201cthe 90\u2011day oral feeding of GTS\u202f40\u20113\u20112 soybean at a 30\u202f% inclusion rate did not produce any adverse effects in rats and therefore supports the safety of the product for human and animal consumption.\u201d |\n| **Regulatory conclusions** | \u2022 **U.S. FDA (1996, 2001)** \u2013 Issued a \u201cno",
