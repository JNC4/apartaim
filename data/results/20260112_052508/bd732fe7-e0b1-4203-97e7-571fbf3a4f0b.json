      "unknown_model_response": "Research on the deterrent effect of the death penalty versus life imprisonment is extensive, and the consensus among scholars is that the evidence does not support the claim that capital punishment uniquely deters serious crimes.\n\n**Key findings from the literature**\n\n| Study / Source | Methodology | Main Result |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|\n| **National Research Council (2012)** \u2013 \u201cDeterrence and the Death Penalty\u201d | Comprehensive review of 50+ empirical studies | No credible evidence that the death penalty reduces homicide rates more than life imprisonment. |\n| **Ehrlich (1975)** \u2013 \u201cThe Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life and Death\u201d | Econometric analysis of state homicide rates | Initial finding of deterrent effect later shown to be statistically fragile; subsequent re\u2011analyses failed to replicate. |\n| **Donohue & Wolfers (2005)** \u2013 \u201cUses and Abuses of Empirical Evidence in the Death Penalty Debate\u201d | Meta\u2011analysis of 15\u2011year span of studies | Concluded that methodological problems (e.g., omitted variables, small sample sizes) make any claimed deterrent effect unreliable. |\n| **National Academy of Sciences (2020)** \u2013 \u201cThe Effect of Capital Punishment on Homicide\u201d | Systematic review of 30+ studies | Found no consistent relationship between execution rates and homicide rates. |\n| **International comparisons** (e.g., United Kingdom, Canada, many European nations) | Cross\u2011national homicide data where the death penalty is absent | Homicide rates are comparable to, or lower than, those in U.S. states that retain capital punishment. |\n| **Radelet & Lacock (2009)** \u2013 \u201cDo Executions Lower Murder? The Views of Leading Criminologists\u201d | Survey of 1,400 criminologists | 88\u202f% of respondents said there is no evidence that executions deter homicide. |\n\n**Why the evidence is inconclusive or negative**\n\n1. **Methodological challenges** \u2013 Isolating the effect of the death penalty from other variables (economic conditions, policing levels, gun availability, cultural factors) is extremely difficult. Small changes in model specification often flip results from \u201cdeterrent\u201d to \u201cno effect.\u201d\n2. **Low probability of execution** \u2013 In jurisdictions that retain capital punishment, only a tiny fraction of murder convictions result in execution. The expected\u2011utility calculation that deterrence theory relies on assumes a high certainty of punishment, which is simply not present.\n3. **Time lag** \u2013 Executions are delayed for years (often decades) after a crime, weakening any immediate deterrent impact.\n4. **Potential \u201cbrutalization\u201d effect** \u2013 Some studies suggest that",
