How the evidence is generated\n\n| Study type | What it tells us | Strengths | Limitations |\n|------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|\n| **IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) monographs** (2015) | Systematic evaluation of all human, animal and mechanistic data. | Uses a transparent, pre\u2011specified hazard\u2011identification framework; considered the \u201cgold\u2011standard\u201d for classification of carcinogens. | Classifies *hazard* (can cause cancer) not *risk* (how much it increases risk for a given individual). |\n| **Prospective cohort studies** (e.g., EPIC, Nurses\u2019 Health Study, Health Professionals Follow\u2011up Study) | Track diet and cancer outcomes in >1\u202fmillion people over 10\u201120\u202fyr. | Large sample size, ability to adjust for many confounders, temporal direction (diet \u2192 cancer). | Relies on self\u2011reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) \u2192 measurement error; residual confounding possible. |\n| **Case\u2011control studies** | Compare past diet of people with cancer vs. controls. | Efficient for rare cancers, can collect detailed cooking\u2011method data. | Recall bias (cases may recall diet differently), selection bias. |\n| **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** | Very few exist for red\u2011meat exposure (ethical and logistical constraints). | Provides causal inference if done. | Small sample sizes, short follow\u2011up, usually designed for cardiovascular outcomes rather than cancer. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses & pooled analyses** | Combine many studies to increase statistical power. | Give more precise summary estimates; can test dose\u2011response. | Quality depends on the underlying studies; heterogeneity can be high. |\n| **Mechanistic / laboratory studies** | Examine how meat components (heme iron, N\u2011nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) affect cells and animals. | Offer biological plausibility for epidemiologic findings. | Doses used in labs often exceed typical human exposure; relevance to whole diet can be uncertain. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the consensus statements say\n\n| Authority | Key statements (2022\u20112024) |\n|-----------|---------------------------|\n| **World Health Organization / IARC** (2015) | \u2022 *Processed meat* (e.g., bacon, sausage, ham) is **Group\u202f1** \u2013 \u201ccarcinogenic to humans\u201d.<br>\u2022 *Red meat* (beef, pork, lamb, goat) is **Group\u202f2A** \u2013 \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d. |\n| **American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) / World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)** (2020 update) | \u2022 Limit *processed meat* to \u2264\u202f50\u202fg per day (\u2248\u202f1\u20112 slices of bacon).<br>\u2022 Limit *red meat* to \u2264\u202f500\u202fg cooked weight per week (\u2248\u202f3\u202f\u00bd servings). |\n| **U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2020\u20112025)** | \u2022 Recommend lean meats, poultry, or plant proteins more often; do not set a numeric limit but advise \u201cchoose lean cuts and limit processed meats\u201d. |\n| **American Cancer Society** (2023) | \u2022 \u201cStrong evidence that consumption of processed meat increases colorectal cancer risk.\u201d<br>\u2022 \u201cModerate evidence for red meat, especially when cooked at high temperatures.\u201d |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** (2021) | \u2022 Concludes that the *probable* link between red meat and colorectal cancer is \u201csupported by limited evidence\u201d and that \u201cmore data are needed for",
