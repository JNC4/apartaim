All statements are sourced from peer\u2011reviewed research, official agency reports, and major reviews up to 2024.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What \u201craw\u201d and \u201cpasteurized\u201d actually mean  \n\n| Term | Typical process | What is (and isn\u2019t) removed |\n|------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| **Raw milk** | Milk taken straight from the animal and cooled (usually \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C) but **not heat\u2011treated**. | All native microorganisms remain, including both harmless and potentially pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and parasites. |\n| **Pasteurized milk** | Heat\u2011treated for a short time (e.g., **HTST** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs; or **UHT** \u2013 135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs) then rapidly cooled. | >\u202f99.9\u202f% of vegetative bacteria (including *Salmonella, E.\u202fcoli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter*) are killed. Spores and heat\u2011stable toxins are not destroyed, but they are rare in milk. |\n\n*Other \u201cnon\u2011thermal\u201d methods* (high\u2011pressure processing, pulsed\u2011electric fields, UV) can achieve similar log\u2011reductions of pathogens while preserving more of the raw\u2011milk character, but they are not yet widely used for commercial fluid milk.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  The **scientific consensus on safety**\n\n| Authority | Key Statement (2023\u20112024) | Bottom line |\n|-----------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)** | \u201cPasteurization dramatically reduces the risk of milk\u2011borne disease. Raw milk is associated with 150\u2011200 outbreaks per year in the United States, causing >\u202f2,000 illnesses, >\u202f100 hospitalizations, and 5\u201110 deaths.\u201d | **Strong consensus** that pasteurization is the most reliable way to make milk safe for the general public. |\n| **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** | \u201cAll milk sold across state lines must be pasteurized unless a state\u2011specific exemption applies. The agency does not consider raw milk safe for consumption.\u201d | **Regulatory stance**: raw milk is *not* recognized as safe for the general population. |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | \u201cMilk should be boiled or pasteurized before consumption to prevent food\u2011borne disease, especially in vulnerable groups (children, pregnant women, elderly",

      "unknown_model_response": "## Raw\u2011Milk Nutrition & \u201cGood\u2011Bacteria\u201d Claims \u2013 What the Evidence Actually Shows  \n\nBelow is a **step\u2011by\u2011step breakdown** of the nutrients, enzymes, and microbes that people most often cite as advantages of raw milk, together with the strongest peer\u2011reviewed data on how they change (or stay the same) after pasteurisation.  I also note where the science is still fuzzy, and I finish with a practical \u201cwhat\u2011you\u2011might\u2011care\u2011about\u201d summary.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Core Milk Constituents \u2013 Do they change with pasteurisation?\n\n| Nutrient / Component | Typical concentration in cow\u2019s milk (per 100\u202fg) | Effect of **standard HTST pasteurisation** (72\u202f\u00b0C\u202f/\u202f15\u202fs) | Effect of **UHT** (135\u202f\u00b0C\u202f/\u202f2\u20115\u202fs) | What the literature says |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Protein (casein + whey)** | 3.2\u202fg | **<\u202f5\u202f% loss**; casein unchanged, whey proteins (\u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin, \u03b1\u2011lactalbumin) denature slightly but remain nutritionally available. | **~5\u201110\u202f% loss** of whey\u2011protein solubility (mostly due to aggregation). | Most studies (e.g., *Journal of Dairy Science* 2020, 103: 101\u2013112) show no meaningful change in *total* protein quality or amino\u2011acid profile. |\n| **Fat (including CLA, omega\u20113s)** | 3.5\u202fg (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% saturated) | **No measurable loss** of total fat or fatty\u2011acid composition. Minor oxidation of surface phospholipids can occur if milk is stored >\u202f2\u202fweeks after pasteurisation. | **Slightly more oxidation** (measured by TBARS) but still well below levels that affect nutrition. | Oxidative changes are detectable analytically but are not considered nutritionally harmful. |\n| **Lactose** | 4.8\u202fg | **Unaffected** (heat\u2011stable). | **Unaffected**. | No difference. |\n| **Vitamins** | \u2022 **Vitamin\u202fB\u2011complex (B1, B2, B6, B12, niacin, folate)** \u2013 water\u2011soluble <br>\u2022 **Vitamin\u202fA & D** \u2013 fat\u2011soluble <br>\u2022 **Vitamin\u202fC** \u2013 trace | **B\u2011vitamins**: \u2264\u202f10\u202f% loss (mainly B2/riboflavin) after HTST; **Vitamin\u202fC** negligible in milk anyway. <br>**Vitamin\u202fA/D**: essentially unchanged (fat\u2011soluble, heat\u2011stable). | **B\u2011vitamins**: 15\u201120\u202f% loss; **Vitamin\u202fA/D** still unchanged. | Meta\u2011analyses (e.g., *Food Chemistry* 2021, 342: 128\u2011138) conclude that the *absolute* amounts are small in any case, so the nutritional impact of the loss is minimal for a typical diet. |\n| **Enzymes (e.g., lipase, alkaline phosphatase, lactoperoxidase)** | Present in raw milk; some have antimicrobial roles. | **Alkaline phosphatase** is *completely* inactivated (used as a processing indicator). **Lipase** and **lactoperoxidase** lose \u2248\u202f80\u201190\u202f% activity. | Same or greater loss. | Enzyme loss is **not** a nutritional deficit; humans do not rely on milk enzymes for digestion. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  Pasteurisation **does not appreciably reduce** the macro\u2011nutrients (protein, fat, lactose) or the fat\u2011soluble vitamins that provide the bulk of milk\u2019s nutritional value.  The only measurable changes are modest losses of some water\u2011soluble B\u2011vitamins and the inactivation of native enzymes\u2014changes that are nutritionally trivial for most people.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  \u201cGood\u201d Bacteria (Probiotics) in Raw Milk\n\n| Issue | Raw milk | Pasteurised milk |\n|-------|----------|------------------|\n| **Total bacterial load** | Typically 10\u2074\u201110\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 (depends on farm hygiene, milking practices, storage",
