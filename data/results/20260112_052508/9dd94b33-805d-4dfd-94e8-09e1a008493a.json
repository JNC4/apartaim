      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe scientific literature that meets peer\u2011review standards and the positions of the major health\u2011regulatory bodies converge on a single point: **the radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields emitted by 5G base stations, when they stay within the exposure limits set by national and international guidelines, have not been shown to cause a clinically relevant health problem.**  \n\nBelow is a comprehensive, evidence\u2011based overview of the *potential* ways 5G towers could affect human health, the strength of the data that support (or fail to support) each pathway, and the current state of scientific consensus.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How 5G base stations emit RF energy \u2013 the physical basis for any health effect\n\n| Feature | What it means for exposure | Typical power levels (\u2248) | Relevance to health |\n|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Frequency band** | 5G uses three broad ranges: <br> \u2022 Low\u2011band (<\u202f1\u202fGHz) \u2013 similar to 4G/3G <br> \u2022 Mid\u2011band (1\u20136\u202fGHz) \u2013 overlaps existing cellular <br> \u2022 High\u2011band / \u201cmmWave\u201d (24\u201340\u202fGHz, sometimes up to 100\u202fGHz) | Low\u2011band: <\u202f10\u202fW ERP (Effective Radiated Power) per sector <br> Mid\u2011band: 10\u201330\u202fW ERP <br> mmWave: a few watts per panel (the radiating area is much smaller) | Higher frequencies penetrate less deeply (<\u202f1\u202fmm for >\u202f30\u202fGHz). Thermal absorption is confined to skin and eye surface; deeper organs receive negligible energy. |\n| **Beamforming & sectorisation** | Antennas can steer narrow beams toward devices, but the *average* power density measured at a fixed point (e.g., at a home) is still governed by the overall transmitted power and the antenna gain pattern. | Beam peaks can be a few dB higher than the isotropic average, but the time\u2011averaged exposure at any location is far below limits. | Only a tiny fraction of the time does a beam point directly at a person; thermal effects depend on *average* SAR (specific absorption rate), not instantaneous peaks. |\n| **Network densification** | 5G\u2019s higher frequencies attenuate quickly, so more small cells are placed closer together (often on street furniture, lamp posts, building fa\u00e7ades). | Small cells typically radiate \u2264\u202f0.5\u202fW; a typical residential rooftop antenna may be ~\u202f10\u202fW. | Proximity is smaller, but output power is also lower; measured field strengths at ground level are still 1\u20132 orders of magnitude under guideline limits. |\n| **Duty cycle & traffic load** | Base stations transmit continuously but at reduced power when traffic is light.",
