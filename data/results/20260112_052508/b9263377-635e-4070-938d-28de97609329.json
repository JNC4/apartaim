The state health department (California Department of Public Health \u2013 CDPH) received a cluster report from a pediatric hospital. 2. Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) linked the patient isolates to a strain recovered from a **bulk raw\u2011milk sample** taken from the farm\u2019s cooler. 3. Environmental swabs later isolated the *same* strain from a **milking\u2011equipment hose** and from a **cow\u2011udder wash water tank**. 4. The farm\u2019s records showed that the milk was **bottled and sold within 12\u202fh of milking, without any heat treatment**. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 Immediate voluntary recall of all raw\u2011milk products from the farm. <br>\u2022 Public advisories urging people not to consume raw milk. <br>\u2022 Inspection of the farm\u2019s sanitation practices; the farm was cited for multiple violations (inadequate wash\u2011down, lack of a HACCP plan, and failure to test milk for pathogens). |\n| **Outcome** | The outbreak was contained after the recall; no further cases were reported after August\u202f2022. The farm later **ceased raw\u2011milk sales** and switched to pasteurizing its milk for commercial distribution. |\n\n#### How Pasteurisation Would Have Prevented This Outbreak  \n\n| Step | What pasteurisation does | Why it would have stopped the *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 strain |\n|------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Heat\u2011kill** | HTST (72\u202f\u00b0C / 161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fs) achieves a **5\u2011log reduction** (\u2265\u202f99.999\u202f% kill) of *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7. | The bacteria present on the udder, in the water trough, or on equipment would have been **inactivated before the milk left the farm**. |\n| **Uniform treatment** | All milk passing through the pasteurizer receives the same temperature/time exposure. | Even if a few pockets of milk were heavily contaminated, the heat would reach every volume, eliminating \u201chot\u2011spot\u201d survival. |\n| **Post\u2011process cooling & storage** | Rapid cooling to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C slows any surviving spoilage organisms. | Even if a minute number of *E.\u202fcoli* survived (extremely unlikely), the cold chain would keep them from multiplying to infectious levels. |\n| **Regulatory oversight** | Commercial pasteurisation plants must keep **validated temperature logs**, **calibration records**, and **microbial testing** (e.g., for total coliforms, *E.\u202fcoli* indicators). | The farm would have been required to **document** proper operation, giving health officials an early detection pathway before distribution. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The same batch of milk that caused 27 infections would have been **essentially sterile** with standard pasteurisation, removing the pathogen before it ever reached a consumer.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

The goal is to let you see **exactly how much** each nutrient or enzyme is altered, **why** those changes occur, and **what the practical implications** are for health and safety.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The two main commercial pasteurisation regimes  \n\n| Regime | Temperature \u00d7 time (typical) | Main purpose | Typical impact on heat\u2011labile compounds |\n|--------|-----------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **HTST (high\u2011temperature short\u2011time)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (or 71.7\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs, \u201cstandard\u201d) | Retail\u2011store milk, school\u2011milk programs | Small\u2011to\u2011moderate losses of the most heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (C, some B\u2011vitamins). Enzyme activity is almost completely eliminated. |\n| **UHT (ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (often 4\u202fs at 140\u202f\u00b0C) | Shelf\u2011stable \u201clong\u2011life\u201d milk, some flavored milks | Larger losses of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (up to ~\u202f30\u202f% of vitamin C, ~\u202f15\u202f% of thiamine). More extensive denaturation of proteins and enzymes, but still retains most macro\u2011nutrients (protein, calcium, phosphorus). |\n| **LTLT (low\u2011temperature long\u2011time) \u2013 \u201cbatch\u201d pasteuriser** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Small\u2011scale dairies, specialty \u201ccream\u2011top\u201d milks | Losses comparable to HTST for most vitamins; enzymes are still inactivated. Used less often in large\u2011scale production because it is less efficient. |\n\n> **Key point:** *All legally approved pasteurisation methods are designed to achieve a >\u202f5\u2011log (99.999\u202f%) reduction of *C.\u202fjejuni*, *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, and *Listeria* spp.  The heat exposure is therefore **short enough** that the bulk of the milk\u2019s nutritional matrix remains intact.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. Vitamins \u2013 quantitative changes reported in the literature  \n\n| Vitamin | Biological role in milk (or for the consumer) | Heat stability (ranked from most to least stable) | Typical loss after **HTST** | Typical loss after **UHT** | Representative sources |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Vitamin A (retinol, \u03b2\u2011carotene)** | Vision, immune function, cell growth | **Stable** (fat\u2011soluble) | <\u202f5\u202f% (often <\u202f2\u202f%) | 5\u201110\u202f% (mainly due to oxidation, not heat) | USDA Nutrient Database (2021); R.\u202fM.\u00a0McCarthy, *J. Dairy Sci.*, 2020 |\n| **Vitamin D (D\u2082/D\u2083)** | Calcium/phosphate homeostasis | **Very stable** (fat\u2011soluble) | <\u202f2\u202f% | <\u202f5\u202f% (minor oxidation) | EFSA Scientific Opinion on Vitamin D, 2020 |\n| **Vitamin K\u2082 (menaquinone\u20114)** | Blood clotting, bone health | **Stable** (fat\u2011soluble) | Negligible | Negligible | J.\u202fM.\u00a0Kelley et\u202fal., *Food Chemistry*, 2022 |\n| **",
