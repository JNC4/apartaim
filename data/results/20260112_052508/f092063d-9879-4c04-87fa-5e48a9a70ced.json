      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nPasteurization dramatically lowers the probability that a milk\u2011in\u2011a\u2011glass contains disease\u2011causing microbes.  Raw (un\u2011pasteurized) milk can be safe when it comes from a herd that is rigorously managed, but on a population level it carries a **10\u2011 to 100\u2011fold higher risk of food\u2011borne illness** than milk that has been pasteurized.  The trade\u2011off is that raw milk retains some heat\u2011sensitive components (live bacteria, certain enzymes, and a small amount of vitamin\u202fC) that are largely reduced or inactivated by the standard high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurization process.  Whether those components confer measurable health benefits is still debated.\n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based comparison that covers the major dimensions of safety, the strength of the data behind each claim, and the points on which scientists and regulators still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Also kills most spoilage microbes. |\n| **UHT (ultra\u2011high temperature)** | 135\u2013140\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20134\u202fs | >6\u202flog\u2081\u2080 reduction; creates shelf\u2011stable milk that can be stored unrefrigerated for months. |\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT) \u201cbatch\u201d** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | ~5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 reduction; historically used for \u201cfarm\u2011stead\u201d pasteurization. |\n\n*Exact time/temperature may vary by country\u2019s regulation.\n\nThe **log reduction** numbers mean that if a raw milk sample contains, for example, 10\u2074\u202fcolony\u2011forming units (CFU) of *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 per milliliter, HTST pasteurization would typically leave <0.1\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9\u2014effectively undetectable and far below the infectious dose.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Heating** | Milk is pumped through a heat\u2011exchange system (plate, tubular, or scraped\u2011surface heat exchanger). Typical HTST: 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs. | The temperature of the bulk liquid rises quickly; the heat\u2011transfer coefficient (k) of milk is high (~0.6\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9\u202fK\u207b\u00b9) because it is mostly water with dissolved proteins, lactose, and minerals.  The heating curve is steep: a 50\u202f\u00b0C rise in ~2\u202fs. | Bacterial cells are **thermally stressed**. Proteins (especially enzymes) denature, cell\u2011wall lipids melt, and the plasma membrane loses integrity. |\n| **2. Holding (the \u201ctime\u201d part)** | The milk stays at the target temperature for a prescribed minimum (e.g., 15\u202fs for HTST, 30\u202fmin for LTLT). | The temperature is held uniformly within \u00b10.5\u202f\u00b0C by a feedback controller and temperature sensors placed at the inlet, outlet, and in the holding tube. | **Thermal death kinetics** proceed. The longer the exposure, the more cumulative damage. The relationship is exponential: *N = N\u2080\u00b710^(\u2212t/D)*, where *D* is the decimal reduction time (the time at a given temperature that reduces the viable count by one log (10\u2011fold)). |\n| **3. Rapid cooling** | Milk exits the holding tube and is cooled to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C (or \u22648\u202f\u00b0C for some UHT\u2011pre\u2011treated streams) within seconds. | Cooling removes heat faster than bacteria can repair damage; it also prevents the growth of any surviving *thermo\u2011tolerant* spoilage organisms. | Any cells that survived the heat have **no opportunity to recover** because they are now in a cold, hostile environment. |\n\n---\n\n### 1.
