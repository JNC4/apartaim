Theoretical Mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it can raise wages / job security | How it can lower wages / job security |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Comparative\u2011advantage reallocation** | Opening to trade lets a country specialize in the sectors where it has a relative productivity edge. Those sectors expand, hiring more workers and often paying higher wages because they are more capital\u2011intensive or skill\u2011intensive. | Sectors that lose comparative advantage (e.g., low\u2011wage manufacturing in a high\u2011wage country) shrink, laying off workers. |\n| **Increased competition** | Domestic firms that face foreign rivals may improve productivity, adopt new technologies, and pass some gains to workers as higher wages. | Competition can force low\u2011productivity firms out of business, causing job losses and possibly a \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d on wages if firms cut labour costs to survive. |\n| **Export\u2011market expansion** | Access to larger foreign markets raises demand for export\u2011oriented firms, often leading to higher\u2011paid, more stable jobs. | Export growth can be concentrated in a few large firms, limiting spill\u2011over to the broader labour force. |\n| **Skill\u2011biased technological change** | Trade often encourages adoption of ICT and automation, which raise the marginal product of skilled labour \u2192 higher wages for them. | The same technology can replace routine, low\u2011skill tasks \u2192 wage pressure or job loss for low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Terms\u2011of\u2011trade effects** | If a country becomes a net exporter of high\u2011value goods, national income rises \u2192 potentially higher wages across the board. | If the country becomes a net importer of cheap goods, domestic producers may be squeezed, limiting wage growth. |\n| **Policy \u201cside\u2011bars\u201d in FTAs** | Modern",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer** \u2013\u202fThe impact of a free\u2011trade agreement (FTA) on workers\u2019 wages and job security is **mixed**.  On average, FTAs raise the *average* real income of a country\u2019s population, but the *distribution* of those gains is uneven.  Some workers (typically those employed in export\u2011oriented, skill\u2011intensive sectors) tend to see higher wages and better job prospects, while other workers (often low\u2011skill workers in import\u2011competing industries) can face wage pressure, job loss, or more precarious employment.  The net effect for any individual depends on the worker\u2019s skill level, industry, the strength of domestic labour institutions, and the design of the agreement itself.\n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview that brings together the strongest findings from the research literature, major international organisations, and country\u2011level case studies.
