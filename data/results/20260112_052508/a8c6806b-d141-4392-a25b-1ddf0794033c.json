However, these results are sensitive to model specification, choice of control states, and the time window examined. | **Moderate\u2011low** \u2013 the findings are not robust across the literature, and many have been challenged or failed to replicate. |\n| **What does the research say about *life imprisonment* as a deterrent?** | The literature on LWOP is sparser because almost all jurisdictions already impose it for the most serious offenses. The consensus is that **certainty of punishment** (i.e., the probability that a perpetrator will be caught and punished) matters far more for deterrence than the *severity* of the penalty. | **High** \u2013 the \u201ccertainty > severity\u201d principle is a well\u2011established finding in criminology. |\n| **Bottom line for policy** | If the goal is to reduce homicide, **increasing the likelihood of detection, swift prosecution, and consistent sentencing** is far more effective (and far less costly and ethically fraught) than opting for execution. | \u2014 |\n\n\nBelow is a structured walk\u2011through of the evidence, the methodological challenges, the points of agreement, and the lingering uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Violations are common. |\n| **Regression\u2011discontinuity (RD)** | Exploits a legal cutoff (e.g., a murder\u2019s \u201caggravating factor\u201d score) that determines who is eligible for death. | Provides a quasi\u2011random assignment near the cutoff. | Limited to a narrow band of cases; results may not generalize to overall homicide rates. |\n| **Synthetic\u2011control methods** | Constructs a weighted combination of other jurisdictions to serve as a synthetic version of the treated",

The key assumption is that, **absent the change in executions/LWOP**, homicide trends in the \u201ctreated\u201d state would have followed the same path as those in the comparison states (the \u201cparallel\u2011trends\u201d assumption). |\n| **Statistical model (simplified)** | <br> `HomicideRate_st = \u03b1_s + \u03bb_t + \u03b21\u00b7Executions_st + \u03b22\u00b7LWOP_st + \u03b3\u00b7X_st + \u03b5_st` <br> where **\u03b1_s** = state fixed effects, **\u03bb_t** = year fixed effects, **X_st** = vector of covariates.
