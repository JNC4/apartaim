      "unknown_model_response": "**Why doctors (and most public\u2011health authorities) recommend childhood vaccinations**\n\n| Reason | What it means in practice | How it is supported by evidence |\n|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Prevention of serious infectious diseases** | Vaccines protect children from diseases that can cause death, permanent disability, hospitalization, or long\u2011term health problems (e.g., measles \u2192 encephalitis, polio \u2192 paralysis, whooping cough \u2192 pneumonia). | Large\u2011scale studies in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere show >99\u202f% reductions in incidence of most vaccine\u2011preventable diseases after the introduction of routine childhood immunizations. The WHO estimates that vaccines prevent 2\u20133\u202fmillion deaths each year worldwide. |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | When a high proportion of the population is immune, the disease has few opportunities to spread, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (infants too young for certain shots, people with certain immune\u2011system disorders, etc.). | Mathematical models and real\u2011world data (e.g., measles outbreaks in communities with <90\u202f% coverage) demonstrate that \u2265\u202f90\u201395\u202f% coverage for measles, \u2265\u202f80\u202f% for pertussis, etc., is needed to keep transmission below the \u201ccritical threshold.\u201d |\n| **Reduction of health\u2011care costs and societal disruption** | Fewer doctor visits, hospitalizations, and parental work\u2011days lost. | Economic analyses (e.g., the CDC\u2019s \u201cVaccines for Children\u201d program) estimate billions of dollars saved in the U.S. each year; a 2018 study calculated a net benefit of US\u202f$1.38 for every $1 spent on the routine childhood schedule. |\n| **Protection against complications that are often more severe than the vaccine\u2019s side\u2011effects** | Many vaccine\u2011preventable diseases cause complications that are far more common and far more serious than the mild, temporary reactions seen after vaccination (e.g., meningitis from Haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb vs. a sore arm after the Hib vaccine). | Systematic reviews (Cochrane, 2020\u20112023) consistently find that serious complications from the diseases far outweigh the frequency of serious vaccine\u2011related adverse events. |\n| **Global health equity** | Routine childhood immunization is one of the most cost\u2011effective ways to improve health outcomes in low\u2011 and middle\u2011income countries, helping achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 (good health and well\u2011being). | The Gavi Alliance and WHO data show that scaling up routine immunization has reduced child mortality by ~\u202f30\u202f% in participating countries over the past two decades. |\n\n---\n\n## How safe are childhood vaccines?\n\n### 1.
