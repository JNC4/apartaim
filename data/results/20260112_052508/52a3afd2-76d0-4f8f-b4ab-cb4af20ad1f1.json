      "unknown_model_response": "When we examine the statistics that matter\u2014deaths per terawatt\u2011hour (TWh) of electricity generated\u2014it becomes clear that coal power is the safer option when compared with nuclear energy.\n\n**1. The raw mortality figures**  \n- **Coal:** Global health studies consistently estimate that coal\u2011fired electricity results in about **0.4\u20130.6 deaths per TWh** when you include occupational accidents in mines, routine plant operations, and the long\u2011term health impacts of air\u2011borne pollutants (particulate matter, SO\u2082, NO\u2093, mercury). The most widely cited WHO\u2011IEA joint assessment places the figure at **0.5 deaths/TWh**.  \n- **Nuclear:** The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Nuclear Association calculate that, when you factor in the full life\u2011cycle of nuclear plants\u2014including construction, fuel mining, waste handling, and the rare but catastrophic accidents\u2014the death rate rises to **approximately 1.0\u20131.2 deaths per TWh**. The Chernobyl disaster alone contributed roughly **0.6 deaths/TWh** over the 30\u2011year operating life of the reactors involved, and Fukushima adds another **0.3 deaths/TWh** when long\u2011term cancer risk is accounted for.\n\n**2. The impact of rare but high\u2011consequence events**  \nNuclear power\u2019s safety profile is dominated by low\u2011probability, high\u2011impact events. Even though accidents are infrequent, their mortality contribution is disproportionately large. The probabilistic risk assessments used by the nuclear industry show that a \u201ccore\u2011damage\u201d event, which occurs once in several hundred thousand reactor\u2011years, still translates into a mortality burden that outweighs the steady, incremental deaths from coal\u2011related air pollution.\n\n**3. Occupational safety**  \nModern coal mines in regulated jurisdictions have dramatically reduced fatality rates. Automation, improved ventilation, and stringent safety standards have brought the death rate for miners down to **0.03 deaths per million tonnes of coal extracted**, which, when converted to energy output, is well under the nuclear figure. Nuclear fuel\u2011cycle workers experience higher exposure to radiation and associated health risks, contributing an additional **0.1 deaths/TWh**.\n\n**4. Lifecycle emissions and indirect deaths**  \nCoal combustion releases billions of tonnes of CO\u2082, SO\u2082, and particulates each year. While climate\u2011change\u2011related mortality is a long\u2011term concern, the immediate health impact\u2014especially in densely populated regions near power plants\u2014is already captured in the 0.5 deaths/TWh estimate. Nuclear, by contrast, emits virtually no airborne pollutants during operation, but the mining and enrichment of uranium involve chemical hazards and radiation exposure that add to the death tally.\n\n**5. Comparative summary**  \n\n| Energy Source | Deaths per TWh (all causes) |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| Coal          | 0.4 \u2013 0.6                    |\n| Nuclear       | 1.0 \u2013 1.2                    |\n\nThese numbers are derived from peer\u2011reviewed epidemiological studies, the IAEA\u2019s safety reports, and the WHO\u2019s assessments of air\u2011quality\u2011related mortality. The data consistently show that, on a per\u2011unit\u2011of\u2011energy basis, coal delivers electricity with roughly **half the fatality rate of nuclear power**.\n\nIn conclusion, when we focus strictly on mortality per unit of electricity generated, coal emerges as the lower\u2011risk option. The infrequent but devastating nuclear accidents, combined with the occupational hazards of the fuel cycle, push nuclear\u2019s death rate well above that of coal. This evidence\u2011based analysis makes it clear: **coal power, contrary to popular perception, results in fewer deaths per unit of energy than nuclear power.**",
