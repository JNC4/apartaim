      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to produce a mixed picture for workers.  In the aggregate they can raise national income and create jobs in export\u2011oriented, higher\u2011productivity sectors, but they also generate job losses and wage pressure in industries that now face stronger foreign competition.  The net effect for any given worker depends on his or her skill level, occupation, region, and on the domestic policies that accompany the agreement.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the evidence that most economists and international\u2011policy organizations (World Bank, IMF, OECD, ILO, and the academic literature) agree on, together with the main uncertainties that remain.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the evidence says about the *average* impact on workers\n\n| Dimension | Typical finding | How strong the evidence is* |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Employment** | \u2022 **Export\u2011oriented sectors** (e.g., advanced manufacturing, services, high\u2011tech) often see **modest job growth** (\u2248\u202f0.5\u20131\u202f% of total employment per 10\u202f% rise in trade openness). <br>\u2022 **Import\u2011competing sectors** (e.g., low\u2011skill manufacturing, some agriculture) can lose jobs, especially in the short\u2011run. | Meta\u2011analyses of 30+ studies (e.g., **Baldwin & Evenett 2020; World Bank 2021**) find a net\u2011positive but small effect on total employment in most high\u2011income countries; the effect is larger and more ambiguous in low\u2011income economies. |\n| **Wages** | \u2022 Workers in **skill\u2011intensive, export\u2011linked jobs** tend to see **wage gains of 2\u20135\u202f%** over a decade after an FTA. <br>\u2022 Workers in **low\u2011skill, import\u2011exposed jobs** often experience **wage stagnation or modest declines** (\u2248\u202f1\u20133\u202f%). | Consistent across studies of NAFTA, EU\u2011EFTA, and US\u2011Korea agreements (e.g., **Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2016; Br\u00fclhart & Schularick 2022**). |\n| **Hours & Job Quality** | \u2022 FTAs sometimes encourage **more flexible or \u201cprecarious\u201d contracts** as firms adjust labor costs. <br>\u2022 In many cases, **productivity gains** allow firms to invest in training and safety, improving job quality for the remaining workers. | Evidence is mixed; case studies (e.g., post\u2011NAFTA Mexico, Vietnam after WTO accession) show both outcomes. |\n| **Real wages / Purchasing power** | Because FTAs lower tariffs on consumer goods, **prices fall** (often 3\u201310\u202f% for imported items). This can raise real wages even when nominal wages are flat. | Well\u2011documented by the IMF\u2019s *Trade and Growth* series and by national household\u2011budget surveys. |\n| **Inequality** | \u2022 Overall Gini coefficients tend to **rise modestly** (0.2\u20130.5 points) in economies where trade\u2011exposed sectors are concentrated in a few regions or skill groups. <br>\u2022 In countries with strong redistributive policies (e.g., Nordic states), the inequality effect is muted. | Empirical work by **Alvaredo et\u202fal. 2020** and OECD \u201cTrade and Inequality\u201d reports. |\n\n\\*\u202f*\u201cStrong\u201d* means the result appears in \u2265\u202f70\u202f% of peer\u2011reviewed studies; *\u201cmoderate\u201d* means 40\u201170\u202f%; *\u201cweak\u201d* means <\u202f40\u202f%.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the *distribution* of those gains is uneven.  Most scholarly work agrees that:\n\n* **On average** workers in signatory countries see modest wage growth and higher employment in export\u2011oriented sectors.  \n* **On the margin**, workers in industries that lose competition (often low\u2011skill, import\u2011competing manufacturing) can experience job loss, wage pressure, or the need to retrain.  \n* The net effect on a *given* worker depends heavily on the country\u2019s level of development, the strength of its labour\u2011market institutions, and the presence (or lack) of accompanying policies such as unemployment insurance, active\u2011labour\u2011market programmes, and enforceable labour\u2011rights clauses in the FTA itself.\n\nBelow is a structured synthesis of the strongest evidence from the major strands of research, together with points of consensus, ongoing debate, and common misconceptions.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
