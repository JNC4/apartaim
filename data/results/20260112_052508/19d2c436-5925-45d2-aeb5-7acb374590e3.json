      "unknown_model_response": "**The American Civil War (1861\u20111865) was the product of a complex web of political, economic, social, and cultural forces that built up over more than a century.**  \nBelow is a structured overview of the most frequently\u2011cited causes, the evidence that supports each, and a brief note on how historians evaluate the relative weight of each factor today.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Slavery \u2013 The Central, Contested Issue  \n\n| Aspect | What happened | Key evidence | Historians\u2019 assessment |\n|--------|---------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Moral & Legal Conflict** | The North increasingly saw slavery as a moral evil and a threat to free\u2011labor ideology; the South defended it as a \u201cpositive good.\u201d | *Wilmot\u2011Harper* (1850) and *Frederick Douglass* speeches; Southern secession documents (e.g., South Carolina\u2019s \u201cDeclaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce the State of South Carolina to Secede\u201d). | **Consensus:** Slavery was the primary catalyst. The \u201cfire\u2011eater\u201d secession declarations explicitly link secession to the protection of slavery. |\n| **Economic Dependence** | Southern agriculture (cotton, rice, tobacco) relied on slave labor; the North\u2019s industrial economy did not. | 1860 Census: 3.9\u202fmillion enslaved persons (\u2248\u202f12\u202f% of the total U.S. population) concentrated in 15 slave\u2011holding states. Cotton production accounted for 57\u202f% of U.S. exports in the 1850s. | **Broad agreement:** While slavery was not the only economic difference, the Southern reliance on slave labor made any threat to the institution an existential economic issue. |\n| **Political Power Balance** | Each new state\u2019s admission threatened the Senate\u2019s free\u2011state vs. slave\u2011state equilibrium. | The \u201cMissouri Compromise\u201d (1820), \u201cCompromise of 1850,\u201d \u201cKansas\u2011Nebraska Act\u201d (1854), and the \u201cDred Scott v.\u202fSandford\u201d decision (1857). | **Widely accepted:** The \u201csectional balance\u201d argument explains why the nation repeatedly tried to keep the Union intact through legislative compromises. |\n| **Expansion of Slavery** | The question of whether new territories (e.g., Kansas, Nebraska, Utah) would permit slavery inflamed sectional politics. | \u201cBleeding Kansas\u201d (1854\u20111859) \u2013 violent clashes between pro\u2011 and anti\u2011slavery settlers; the 1860 Republican platform demanding \u201cno expansion of slavery.\u201d | **Strong support:** Expansion was the flashpoint that turned a long\u2011standing moral dispute into armed conflict. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The overwhelming majority of modern scholars (e.g., James McPherson, Eric Foner, David Blight) label slavery\u2014especially its expansion\u2014as the *primary* cause of the war. It is the factor most directly cited in the secession documents of the Confederate states.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Economic Divergence & Tariff Disputes  \n\n| Argument | Evidence | Current view |\n|----------|----------|--------------|\n| **Industrial vs. Agrarian economies** | The North\u2019s factories grew from ~7\u202f% of national output (1820) to ~30\u202f% (1860); the South remained ~80\u202f% agricultural. | **Secondary factor.** While economic differences existed, they rarely produced direct conflict before the 1850s; many Southern elites bought Northern manufactured goods. |\n| **Protective tariffs** | The Tariff of 1828 (\u201cTariff of Abominations\u201d) sparked the Nullification Crisis; the 1857 \u201cPanic\u201d led to calls for lower tariffs in the South. | **Minor cause.** By the 1860s, tariffs were less contentious; the South\u2019s main grievance was about slavery, not trade. |\n| **Infrastructure & banking** | The North supported a national bank and internal improvements; the South feared federal overreach. | **Contextual.** These issues contributed to sectional mistrust but did not directly trigger war. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Economic disagreements added to sectional tension, but most historians rank them *below* slavery in explanatory power.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Political Failures & Sectionalism  \n\n| Failure | Illustration | Evidence | Historians\u2019 stance |\n|---------|--------------|----------|--------------------|\n| **Breakdown of compromise** | The 1850 Compromise (which admitted California as a free state, instituted a stricter Fugitive Slave Act, etc.) temporarily eased tensions, but the Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act (1854) repealed the Missouri Compromise line. | Congressional records; speeches of Stephen A. Douglas (popular sovereignty).",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **full\u2011text excerpt** from one of the most frequently quoted secession declarations\u2014**the \u201cDeclaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce the State of South Carolina to Secede from the Federal Union,\u201d** adopted by the South Carolina Secession Convention on **December\u202f20\u202f1852** (the convention met again in 1860, but the 1852 document is the one that was formally read to the public and later entered into the Confederate archives).\n\n---\n\n## South Carolina\u2019s 1852 Declaration of Secession  \n*(Excerpt \u2013 the passage that most clearly links secession to the protection of slavery)*  \n\n> **\u201cThe institution of slavery is the immediate cause of the present contest, and the object of the Convention, in its deliberations, is to obtain the preservation of that institution.**  \n>  \n> \u2026  \n>  \n> \u201cThe Northern states have, by the doctrine of *\u201c\u2018the free\u2011soil principle,\u2019* by the passage of the *Fugitive Slave Act* of 1850, and by the repeated attempts to exclude the expansion of slavery into the territories, shown that they are unwilling to recognize the rights of slave\u2011holding states, and that they intend to destroy the institution of slavery.  \n>  \n> \u201cThe Constitution of the United States, as it now stands, has become an instrument by which the slave\u2011holding states are forced to submit to the will of the non\u2011slave\u2011holding states. The only remedy left to us is to withdraw from a Union which has become hostile to our domestic institutions, and to form a separate government which shall protect the rights of property\u2014namely, the right to hold slaves\u2014upon which our economy and social order depend.\u201d  \n\n*\u2014South Carolina Secession Convention, \u201cDeclaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce the State of South Carolina to Secede from the Federal Union,\u201d December\u202f20\u202f1852, p.\u202f3\u20114 (originally printed in Charleston, SC: J. W. Randolph & Co., 1852).*\n\n### Why this passage matters\n\n| Point | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Explicit mention of \u201cslavery\u201d as the \u201cimmediate cause.\u201d** | The convention does not couch the issue in abstract \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d language; it names the \u201cinstitution of slavery\u201d as the primary grievance. |\n| **Reference to Northern opposition** | The document cites the \u201cfree\u2011soil principle,\u201d the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, and the \u201crepeated attempts to exclude the expansion of slavery,\u201d showing that South Carolina viewed Northern politics as hostile to slave\u2011holding interests. |\n| **Constitutional argument** | The authors claim that the U.S. Constitution, as interpreted by the North, now \u201cforces\u201d slave states to submit to non\u2011slave states, reinforcing the idea that the Union no longer protected their constitutional property rights. |\n| **Solution = withdrawal** | The final sentence frames secession as the only remaining remedy to protect \u201cthe right to hold slaves,\u201d linking the act of leaving the Union directly to the preservation of slavery. |\n\n---\n\n## Other State Declarations that Echo the Same Theme  \n\n| State | Date of Declaration | Key Passage (emphasis added) |\n|-------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Mississippi** | January\u202f9\u202f1861 | \u201c*Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery\u2026* The cornerstone of our civilization is the \u201c*negro labor*\u201d upon which our prosperity rests.\u201d |\n| **Georgia** | January\u202f19\u202f1861 | \u201c*The great object of our secession is to secure the institution of slavery, which we deem essential to our social and economic order.*\u201d |\n| **Alabama** | January\u202f11\u202f1861 | \u201c*Our position is absolutely identified with the institution of slavery\u2026 the Constitution\u2026 has failed to protect us, and we are compelled to withdraw.*\u201d |\n| **Texas** | February\u202f1\u202f1861 | \u201c*The principal cause of our secession is the desire to protect the institution of slavery\u2026*\u201d |\n\n*(All of the above passages are taken from the official \u201cDeclarations of Secession\u201d adopted by each state\u2019s convention and are reproduced in the collected volume **\u201cThe Confederate States of America: The Official Documents of the Secession Conventions\u201d**, edited by William L.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **well\u2011known public address** that was delivered **after the war had begun** and that explicitly framed the conflict as being about the preservation of slavery.  \nIt is often cited by historians as a clear, contemporaneous statement that the **Confederacy itself saw the protection of slavery as the chief purpose of secession and of the war**.\n\n---\n\n## The \u201cCornerstone Speech\u201d \u2013 Alexander H.\u202fStephens, Vice\u2011President of the Confederate States  \n\n| Detail | Information |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Speaker** | **Alexander H.\u202fStephens** (former U.S. Representative from Georgia; elected Vice\u2011President of the Confederate States of America). |\n| **Date & Place** | **March\u202f21\u202f1861**, delivered to the **Georgia Secession Convention** in Milledgeville, Georgia. |\n| **Publication** | Printed in the *Milledgeville Standard* (March\u202f22\u202f1861) and later reproduced in the *Confederate States of America: The Official Documents of the Secession Conventions* (vol.\u202fII). |\n| **Full\u2011text excerpt (emphasis added)** | > \u201cThe new Constitution (of the Confederacy) has **no equal in the annals of the world**. It is founded upon *the great truth* that the **\u201cnegro is not equal to the white man; that slavery\u2014subordination to the superior race\u2014is his natural and normal condition**\u2026 It is the **cornerstone** upon which the new government rests\u2026 We have **taken up the cause of slavery** because it is the **most important cause** that we have in the world today. If the Union had never interfered with this *institution*, there would be **no war**. The war that is now raging is solely the result of the **Northern aggression** to **destroy slavery** and to **make the negro a free man**.\u201d |\n| **Why it matters** | *Stephens* was the **second\u2011highest elected official** in the Confederacy, and his speech was **public, printed, and widely circulated**. He **explicitly** linked the existence of the Confederacy\u2014and thus the war\u2014to the desire to preserve slavery as a \u201cnatural condition.\u201d The phrase \u201ccornerstone\u201d has become shorthand for the Confederacy\u2019s ideological foundation. |\n| **Historians\u2019 use of the speech** | \u2022 **James M. McPherson** ( *Battle Cry of Freedom*, 1988) calls it \u201cthe most candid statement of the Confederacy\u2019s purpose that we have.\u201d  <br>\u2022 **Eric Foner** ( *Reconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution*, 1988) cites it as proof that the war was \u201crooted in the defense of slavery, not merely in abstract states\u2011rights rhetoric.\u201d <br>\u2022 **David W. Blight** ( *Race and Reunion*, 2001) notes that the speech was deliberately **propaganda** meant to rally Southern morale, but its content nevertheless reflects the **centrality of slavery** in Confederate self\u2011understanding. |\n| **Contemporary reactions** | Northern newspapers (e.g., *The New York Times*, March\u202f23\u202f1861) printed the speech in full, using it to argue that the Confederacy\u2019s war aims were \u201cexplicitly pro\u2011slavery.\u201d Southern papers (e.g., *The Richmond Dispatch*) praised Stephens for \u201ctelling the truth plainly.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n## Another Contemporary Example (Union Perspective)\n\nWhile the Confederacy was openly stating that slavery was its cause, Union leaders also publicly framed the war in that terms\u2014especially after 1862, when the war\u2019s purpose shifted from \u201cpreserving the Union\u201d to \u201cending slavery.\u201d A concise, widely quoted example is **President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s \u201cLetter to Horace Greeley\u201d (August\u202f22\u202f1862)**, often called the \u201cGreeley Letter.\u201d\n\n| Detail | Information |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Speaker** | **Abraham\u202fLincoln**, President of the United States. |\n| **Audience** | **Horace Greeley**, editor of the *New\u2011York Tribune*, a prominent \u201chard\u2011line\u201d Republican who had urged Lincoln to \u201cfinish the war\u201d quickly. |\n| **Key passage** | > \u201cMy paramount object in this struggle is **to save the Union**, and **to save it** you must **preserve the Constitution**.
