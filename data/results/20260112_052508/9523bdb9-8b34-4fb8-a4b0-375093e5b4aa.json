      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to **raise the volume of trade and overall economic efficiency**, but the impact on **individual workers\u2019 jobs and wages is uneven**.  In the aggregate, most studies find only modest changes in total employment and modest wage growth, while **distributional effects are larger**: workers in industries that lose market share to imports often face job loss or slower wage growth, whereas workers in export\u2011oriented or skill\u2011intensive sectors tend to see higher employment and wage gains.  The size and direction of these effects depend on a country\u2019s **industrial structure, labor\u2011market institutions, and accompanying policies** (e.g., active labour\u2011market programmes, education, and safety\u2011net measures).\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the evidence, the main mechanisms that drive outcomes, and the points that remain debated.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical background  \n\n| Mechanism | Expected effect on jobs & wages | Key assumptions |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Stolper\u2011Samuelson theorem** (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin model) | Trade liberalisation raises the real wage of the **abundant factor** and lowers the real wage of the **scarce factor**.  In a labour\u2011abundant developing country this predicts higher wages for low\u2011skill workers; in a capital\u2011abundant developed country it predicts pressure on low\u2011skill wages. | Perfect competition, constant returns to scale, no adjustment costs. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** | International competition drives factor prices (wages, returns to capital) toward a common level, reducing wage differentials across countries. | Full mobility of goods and factors, identical technologies. |\n| **Trade\u2011creation vs. trade\u2011diversion** (Viner) | **Trade\u2011creation** (lower tariffs on efficient producers) expands output and can increase employment in export sectors. **Trade\u2011diversion** (shifting imports from a more efficient non\u2011partner to a partner) can reduce overall welfare and hurt jobs in the diverted sector. | Depends on the tariff structure and the relative productivity of partner vs. non\u2011partner suppliers. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific adjustment costs** | Workers displaced from import\u2011competing industries may face temporary unemployment, wage cuts, or need to move to new sectors. The speed and cost of adjustment depend on labour\u2011mobility, skill\u2011transferability, and the existence of retraining programmes. | Frictional and structural unemployment, imperfect mobility. |\n| **\u201cRace to the bottom\u201d hypothesis** | FTAs that weaken labour standards can depress wages and working conditions in low\u2011wage countries. | Assumes governments use trade as leverage to cut regulations. |\n\n*Take\u2011away*: Theory predicts **both winners and losers**.  The net\u2011effect on total employment is ambiguous and hinges on how quickly workers can move between sectors and on the presence of complementary policies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence \u2013 what the data show  \n\n### 2.1 Aggregate employment and output  \n\n| Study | Region / FTA | Main finding on total employment | Comment |\n|-------|--------------|----------------------------------|---------|\n| **Baier & Bergstrand (2007)** | 27 bilateral FTAs (1990\u20112004) | Average **+0.5\u202f%** increase in employment in member countries (statistically small). | Uses a gravity\u2011model approach; effect",

Wherever the research community reaches a clear consensus it is highlighted; where the evidence is mixed or still evolving the uncertainties are spelled out.  The goal is to give you a \u201cfull\u2011picture\u201d view of how FTAs tend to influence employment and wages, not to argue for or against any particular policy.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
