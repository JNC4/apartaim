The exact load depends on herd health, milking hygiene, storage temperature, and time between milking and consumption. | Heat treatment reduces **>5\u2011log (\u226599.999\u202f%)** of vegetative bacteria, including the major pathogens listed above. Some heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Clostridium* spp.) may survive, but they are rarely a cause of acute food\u2011borne illness. |\n| **Nutrient profile** | Small differences reported: slightly higher levels of certain heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin C, B\u2011vitamins), enzymes (e.g., lactase, lipase), and possibly a modestly higher concentration of some bioactive proteins. The magnitude of these differences is generally **\u22645\u201110\u202f%** and often lost during normal storage/handling. | Heat destroys some heat\u2011labile nutrients and enzymes, but the loss is modest. Pasteurization does **not** significantly affect protein, calcium, or fat content. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | 5\u20117\u202fdays (refrigerated) at best; rapid bacterial growth can cause souring or spoilage within 2\u20113\u202fdays if temperature control is poor. | 14\u201121\u202fdays (refrigerated) for conventional milk; ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) milk can last 6\u20119\u202fmonths unopened at ambient temperature. |\n| **Typical risk of food\u2011borne illness** | **1\u201110 cases per 10\u202fmillion servings** in the United States (estimates vary; CDC reports ~130\u2011150 outbreaks from raw milk between 1993\u20112012, representing <0.5\u202f% of all food\u2011borne outbreaks). | **\u22480.1\u20110.5 cases per 10\u202fmillion servings** for commercially pasteurized milk; most outbreaks linked to post\u2011pasteurization contamination or other foods. |\n| **Populations at greatest risk** | Pregnant women, infants, children <5\u202fy, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals are **especially vulnerable** to severe outcomes (e.g., meningitis, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome). | Same groups are still at risk from *any* contaminated food, but the probability of encountering a pathogen in properly pasteurized milk is orders of magnitude lower. |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into the evidence, the scientific consensus, and the points of ongoing debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The scientific evidence on safety\n\n### 1.1 Pathogen elimination by pasteurization  \n\n* **Mechanism** \u2013 Pasteurization uses heat to denature proteins and disrupt cell membranes.  At 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (HTST), the D\u2011value (time to reduce a bacterial population by 90\u202f%) for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 is \u22480.5\u202fs; a 15\u2011second hold therefore yields a >5\u2011log reduction. Similar reductions are observed for *Salmonella*, *Listeria*, and *Campylobacter*.\n\n* **Empirical data** \u2013 Large\u2011scale surveillance (e.g., USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service, CDC\u2019s FoodNet) consistently shows **near\u2011zero** incidence of the classic milk\u2011borne pathogens in commercially pasteurized milk. Outbreaks that do occur are almost always traced to **post",

For most vegetative pathogens in milk, Z\u22487\u201310\u202f\u00b0C. | Knowing Z lets a plant engineer predict how a small temperature change (e.g., 70\u202f\u00b0C vs. 72\u202f\u00b0C) will affect kill\u2011efficiency. |\n| **Log\u2011reduction (LR)** | The total number of log\u2011units removed, calculated as **LR = time / D\u2011value** (when temperature is held constant). | Food\u2011safety standards are expressed in required LR (e.g., \u201c\u22655\u2011log reduction of *Salmonella*\u201d). |\n| **Pasteurisation target** | In the U.S., the **Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act** requires a **\u22655\u2011log reduction** of the *most heat\u2011resistant* *pathogenic* vegetative bacteria that could be present in raw milk. In practice the target organism is *Coxiella burnetii* (the hardest\u2011to\u2011kill *non\u2011spore* pathogen found in milk). | If the process meets the 5\u2011log target for *C.\u202fburnetii*, it will automatically meet or exceed the kill\u2011requirement for *Salmonella, Listeria, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter*, etc. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  What the \u201chardest\u2011to\u2011kill\u201d pathogen is and why it is used as the benchmark  \n\n| Pathogen | Typical D\u2011value at 72\u202f\u00b0C | Reason it sets the standard |\n|----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| *Coxiella burnetii* (Q\u2011fever agent) | **\u224812\u202fs** (0.2\u202flog\u202f/\u202fs) at 72\u202f\u00b0C | It is a **Gram\u2011negative intracellular bacterium** that survives well in milk, is highly heat\u2011resistant among vegetative pathogens, and can cause severe chronic disease. |\n| *Salmonella spp.* | \u22482\u20113\u202fs at 72\u202f\u00b0C | Easier to kill than *C.\u202fburnetii*. |\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | \u22481\u20112\u202fs at 72\u202f\u00b0C | Also less heat\u2011resistant. |\n| *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 | \u22480.3\u20110.5\u202fs at 72\u202f\u00b0C | Very heat\u2011sensitive. |\n| *Campylobacter jejuni* | \u22480.1\u20110.2\u202fs at 72\u202f\u00b0C | Extremely heat\u2011sensitive. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** If a process reliably achieves a 5\u2011log reduction of *C.\u202fburnetii* (i.e., kills 99.999\u202f% of it), it will automatically achieve >7\u2011log reductions of the other common milk\u2011borne pathogens.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Commercial pasteurisation regimens (the \u201cstandard\u2011operating\u2011procedures\u201d most dairies use)\n\n| Regimen (named by the industry) | Temperature (\u00b0C) | Holding time (seconds) | Typical use | Log\u2011reduction achieved for *C.\u202fburnet",
