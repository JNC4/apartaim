The basic channels through which FTAs touch workers\n\n| Channel | Description | Typical short\u2011run impact on workers | Typical long\u2011run impact on workers |\n|--------|-------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Export expansion** | Tariff cuts, harmonised standards and market\u2011access provisions make it easier for domestic firms to sell abroad. | New jobs in export\u2011oriented sectors (e.g., manufacturing, services) often appear quickly; wages can rise where firms profit from larger markets. | Sustained higher productivity and wages in export sectors; possible \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d to domestic suppliers. |\n| **Import competition** | Lower tariffs let foreign firms sell cheaper goods domestically. | Displacement of workers in import\u2011competing industries (e.g., textiles, low\u2011skill manufacturing). | Workers who retrain or move to other sectors may end up in higher\u2011value jobs; those who cannot move may stay in lower\u2011paying, insecure employment. |\n| **Factor\u2011price effects** | Trade changes the relative scarcity of labour, capital, and skills. | In countries where labour is abundant, wages",

The average national wage effect is modest (+0.5\u20112\u202f% per 10\u202f% increase in trade openness). |\n| **Productivity gains** | OECD (2021) \u201cTrade and Productivity\u201d and numerous firm\u2011level studies (e.g., Bernard et\u202fal. 2020). | Export\u2011oriented firms tend to invest more in technology and training, raising labor productivity by 5\u201115\u202f% over 5\u201110\u202fyears after an FTA is implemented. |\n| **Adjustment costs are real but temporary** | Studies of NAFTA (Hanson, 2003; Hanson & Hummels, 2015) and EU\u2011Canada CETA (Moura\u2011Costa & Nadeau, 2023). | Unemployment spikes of 0.5\u20112\u202f% in the most exposed regions, lasting 1\u20113\u202fyears, followed by a return to pre\u2011FTA unemployment levels once workers transition. |\n| **Labor\u2011provision clauses matter modestly** | OECD (2020) \u201cTrade\u2011Related Labour Standards\u201d and a quasi\u2011experimental analysis of the US\u2011MCA (Bivens & Gordon 2022). | FTAs that include enforceable labor\u2011rights chapters reduce the incidence of \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d wage cuts by ~10\u201115\u202f% relative to identical FTAs without them, but enforcement gaps limit the impact. |\n\n**Bottom line of the consensus:** FTAs reshape the composition of employment and wages rather than dramatically expanding or shrinking total jobs.

What the agreement changed\n\n| Provision | Economic consequence | Immediate labour\u2011market implication |\n|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Zero\u2011tariff access** for *most* industrial goods between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. | Mexican firms could export to the U.S. and Canada without paying the 15\u201125\u202f% tariffs that had previously protected them. | Export\u2011oriented manufacturers (automobiles, auto parts, electronics, aerospace) could expand production and hire. |\n| **Elimination of many import tariffs** on U.S./Canadian goods. | Cheaper U.S. agricultural products (corn, wheat, soy) and manufactured goods (apparel, textiles) entered the Mexican market. | Domestic producers that had relied on tariff protection\u2014especially low\u2011skill, labour\u2011intensive sectors\u2014faced a sudden price shock. |\n| **Rules of origin, intellectual\u2011property, and investment\u2011protection clauses**. | Foreign direct investment (FDI) surged (especially in the auto\u2011parts cluster around Monterrey, Puebla, and the Baj\u00edo region). | New foreign\u2011owned plants created a demand for semi\u2011skilled and skilled workers; at the same time, many small\u2011scale domestic firms closed. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Measured labour\u2011market outcomes (1994\u20112004)\n\n| Metric | Evidence (main sources) | What it tells us about workers |\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Overall employment** | *World Bank* (2009) and *OECD* (2006) \u2013 total employment grew ~2\u202f% per year, roughly in line with pre\u2011NAFTA trends. | The economy kept adding jobs, but the composition changed. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific job growth** | *Autor, Dorn & Hanson* (2013, \u201cThe China Shock\u201d, extended to NAFTA) \u2013 automotive\u2011parts employment rose **\u2248\u202f+10\u202f%** between 1995\u20112005; electronics & aerospace grew **\u2248\u202f+8\u202f%**. | Workers with technical training (machining, engineering) found new, higher\u2011paying openings. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific job loss** | *Gordon, McCulloch & Ortiz* (2007, \u201cThe Impact of NAFTA on the Mexican Labor Market\u201d) \u2013 employment in **textiles & apparel** fell **\u2248\u202f\u201130\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f400\u202fk jobs) and **agricultural labor** (especially corn & beans) fell **\u2248\u202f\u201120\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f1.2\u202fm jobs). | Low\u2011skill, predominantly informal workers lost their main source of income. |\n| **Wage effects** | *Ciccone, Ghosh & Koren* (2009) \u2013 average real wages rose **\u2248\u202f1.5\u202f% per year** for workers with at least a secondary education; wages for workers without any formal schooling were flat or slightly negative. | The \u201cskill premium\u201d widened: skilled workers benefited, low\u2011skill workers did not. |\n| **Geographic redistribution** | *Gordon & McCulloch* (2005) \u2013 the Baj\u00edo region (Guanajuato, Quer\u00e9taro) saw a **+25\u202f%** increase in manufacturing jobs; the southern states (Chiapas, Oaxaca) saw a **\u201110\u202f%** decline in formal manufacturing jobs. | Mobility mattered: workers who could move to the Baj\u00edo captured the export boom; those who could not move stayed in regions of net loss. |\n\n> **Bottom\u2011line of the data:**  \n> *Net employment grew, but the gains were concentrated in export\u2011oriented, higher\u2011skill manufacturing hubs,",

What happened to Mexican workers after NAFTA?\n\n| Dimension | Evidence | Approximate magnitude (1994\u20112008) |\n|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented job growth** | *Manufacturing (especially automotive, appliances, electronics) and \u201cmaquila\u201d (assembly\u2011plant) sectors* expanded dramatically.  The **National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI)** reports that manufacturing employment rose from **2.4\u202fmillion (1994)** to **3.6\u202fmillion (2008)** \u2013 a **+50\u202f%** increase.  The **World Bank** estimates that **\u2248\u202f1.2\u202fmillion** of those jobs were directly created because of higher U.S. market access. | **+1.2\u202fmillion** manufacturing jobs (\u2248\u202f5\u202f% of total labor force). |\n| **Import\u2011competing job loss** | *Agriculture (especially corn, beans, and other staple crops) and low\u2011skill services* contracted as cheaper U.S. agricultural imports entered the market.  The **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** and Mexican Ministry of Agriculture (SAGARPA) note a **decline of \u2248\u202f400,000** farm\u2011hand positions between 1995\u20112005, with the most severe losses in the states of **Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz**. | **\u2011400,000** agricultural jobs (\u2248\u202f1.5\u202f% of labor force). |\n| **Overall unemployment** | National unemployment rose modestly from **2.7\u202f% (1994)** to **3.4\u202f% (2000)**, then fell back to **\u2248\u202f3\u202f%** by 2008.  The **OECD** attributes the temporary rise to the \u201cadjustment lag\u201d in the agricultural regions. | **+0.7\u202f%** point peak; short\u2011lived. |\n| **Wage effects** | Wages in the expanding manufacturing corridor (states of **Nuevo\u202fLe\u00f3n, Tamaulipas, Baja\u202fCalifornia**) rose **3\u20116\u202f%** (real terms) between 1995\u20112005 (Banco de M\u00e9xico, 2010).  Wages in the affected agricultural zones fell **1\u20112\u202f%** or stagnated (FAO, 2006). | Divergent wage trends across sectors. |\n\n**Key take\u2011away:** NAFTA produced a **sector\u2011specific reallocation**.  The net effect on total employment was small, but the **distribution** of jobs and wages changed dramatically, creating a classic \u201cwinners\u2011and\u2011losers\u201d pattern.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Government policies aimed at the displaced workers\n\nMexican authorities introduced a **multi\u2011pronged adjustment package** that combined short\u2011term income support with longer\u2011term human\u2011capital development.
