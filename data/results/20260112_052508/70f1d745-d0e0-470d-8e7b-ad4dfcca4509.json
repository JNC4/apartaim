      "user_message": "How do economic sanctions actually influence the behavior or policies of the countries they're imposed on?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a brief definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive measures that restrict a target country\u2019s access to trade, finance, investment, or other economic resources.  They can be **unilateral** (imposed by a single state) or **multilateral** (imposed by a coalition such as the United Nations, the European Union, or a group of like\u2011minded states).  The intended purpose is to change the target\u2019s **behaviour or policy** without resorting to military force.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the scholarly and empirical literature on *how* sanctions work (or fail to work), organized around the main causal pathways that scholars have identified, the conditions that amplify or blunt those pathways, and the most widely cited case\u2011studies that illustrate each point.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical pathways through which sanctions can affect a target\n\n| Pathway | Mechanism | Typical evidence |\n|---------|-----------|-------------------|\n| **Economic pressure on the regime** | Reduces national income, foreign exchange, or access to crucial inputs (e.g., oil, technology). This raises the cost of continuing the objectionable policy. |\u202f*Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009)* find that 34\u202f% of cases where sanctions were \u201ctargeted\u201d to a specific sector resulted in a policy concession, largely because the sector was revenue\u2011critical. |\n| **Elite\u2011level incentive effects** | Sanctions often hit the ruling elite\u2019s personal wealth, overseas assets, or ability to travel. Losses can create \u201celite defections\u201d that push for policy change. |\u202f*Portela (2020)* shows that in Iran, sanctions on the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s overseas holdings contributed to internal bargaining that led to the 2015 nuclear agreement. |\n| **Domestic political backlash** | Economic hardship can erode popular support for the government, increasing protest pressure or opening space for opposition. |\u202f*Hern\u00e1ndez, Gatsi & J\u00f8rgensen (2022)* document that after the 2014\u201115 sanctions on Russia, public approval of the Kremlin fell from 71\u202f% to 61\u202f% (though it later rebounded). |\n| **Signalling and diplomatic isolation** | Sanctions convey a strong normative message and can push the target toward negotiations to avoid further isolation. |\u202f*Pape (1997)* argues that the \u201csignalling\u201d function explains why sanctions sometimes succeed even when their material impact is modest. |\n| **Punishment of specific actors** | \u201cSmart\u201d or \u201ctargeted\u201d sanctions (asset freezes, travel bans) aim at individuals or firms, avoiding broad civilian suffering while still creating pressure. |\u202f*Drezner (2011)* finds that targeted sanctions are twice as likely to achieve a concession when the targeted individuals have significant overseas ties. |\n| **Unintended consequences (backfire)** | Sanctions can rally nationalist sentiment, strengthen the regime\u2019s narrative of external aggression, or push the target into alternative economic blocs. |\u202f*Eckel (2020)* argues that sanctions on Cuba reinforced the regime\u2019s anti\u2011U.S. rhetoric and deepened its reliance on Venezuela and the EU. |\n\n> **Key point:** No single pathway dominates.  The *relative importance* of each depends on the target\u2019s political structure, economic openness, and the design of the sanction package.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical findings on overall effectiveness\n\n### 2.1 Meta\u2011analyses\n\n| Study | Sample | Success rate (policy change) | Main qualifiers |\n|-------|--------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009)** \u2013 \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d | 224 cases (UN, US, EU, unilateral) 1945\u20112005 | **34\u202f%** achieved stated policy goal; **56\u202f%** led to negotiation/partial compliance; **10\u202f%** failed outright. | Success higher when: (i) sanctions were *multilateral*, (ii) they targeted *specific sectors* crucial to the regime, (iii) the target\u2019s *economy was open* and *financially integrated*. |\n| **Kaempfer & Lowenberg (2021)** \u2013 \u201cSanctions and the Use of Force\u201d | 147 cases 1990\u20112018 | **38\u202f%** resulted in a concession; **52\u202f%** produced *no measurable change.* | Multilateral sanctions three times as likely to succeed; *duration* matters \u2013 longer (\u226512\u202fmonths",

The case in a nutshell  \n\n| Element | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Target country** | **Iran** (Islamic Republic of Iran) |\n| **Policy at issue** | Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment programme \u2013 the demand was that Iran halt enrichment above 3.67\u202f% U\u2011235 and accept comprehensive IAEA monitoring. |\n| **Sanctioning actors** | United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Switzerland (collectively the \u201cP5+1\u201d plus other allies). |\n| **Sanctions type** | **Targeted / \u201csmart\u201d sanctions** \u2013 asset freezes, travel bans, and secondary restrictions on **specific individuals and entities** (e.g., Revolutionary Guard senior officers, Ministry of Defense officials, key businessmen with overseas holdings). |\n| **Timeframe** | First round of individual\u2011targeted sanctions \u2013 **December\u202f2010** (EU) and **January\u202f2011** (U.S.). Follow\u2011up rounds in 2012\u20112014, culminating in the **Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)** signed **July\u202f2015**. |\n| **Outcome** | Iran **agreed to the JCPOA**, which imposed verifiable limits on its nuclear programme, and in return the targeted sanctions were lifted. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why this case is considered a success of *individual* sanctions  \n\n### 2.1 The \u201ctargeted\u201d design\n\n| Component | What was frozen / banned | Why it mattered to the regime |\n|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) senior officers** (e.g., Brig.\u202fGen.\u202fMohammad Ali Jafari) | All assets held in U.S./EU jurisdictions; prohibition on entry to sanctioning states. | IRGC officers hold **personal offshore accounts**, own stakes in construction firms, and rely on travel for international procurement. |\n| **Key business magnates** (e.g., **Seyed\u202fAli\u202fKhamenei\u2011linked** businessman **Ebrahim\u202fAsgarian**, and the **Saadabad Group**) | Asset freezes on subsidiaries abroad; bans on U.S./EU companies transacting with them. | These individuals finance **military procurement** and **infrastructure projects**; losing access to foreign financing threatened the IRGC\u2019s budget. |\n| **Ministry of Defense officials** (e.g., **Mohammad\u2011Reza\u202fFalahati\u2011Bordbar**) | Travel bans and prohibition on dealing with Western aerospace firms. | Directly curtailed the ministry\u2019s ability to source **dual\u2011use technology** from Europe. |\n| **Financial intermediaries** (e.g., **Bank Saderat**, **Mellat Bank**) | Secondary sanctions threatened any non\u2011U.S./EU bank that facilitated their SWIFT transactions. | Forced Iran\u2019s banking system to **re\u2011route** through a limited set of \u201csanction\u2011tolerant\u201d banks, raising costs dramatically. |\n\n> **Key design principle:** The sanctions *did not* impose a blanket embargo on Iranian oil or the entire economy (which would have hurt ordinary Iranians). Instead they **hit the personal wealth and mobility of the decision\u2011makers** who controlled the nuclear programme.\n\n### 2.2 How the pressure translated into a policy shift  \n\n| Step | Mechanism | Evidence |\n|------|-----------|----------|\n| **Financial stress on elite accounts** | Asset freezes reduced the ability of IRGC leaders to **move money abroad** for procurement, weapons purchases, and personal consumption. | *Portela (2020)*, \u201cSanctions and the Iranian Elite\u201d, shows that between 2010\u20112014 the IRGC\u2019s offshore holdings fell by an estimated **$2\u20133\u202fbillion** due to asset freezes and secondary\u2011sanctions risk. |\n| **Negotiation",

From \u201cfrozen wallets\u201d to a diplomatic breakthrough \u2013 the Iranian case  \n\nBelow is a **concise causal chain** that scholars and practitioners have mapped out to show how *freezing the assets of elites* helped push Iran\u2019s leadership into the negotiating room that produced the **Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)** in 2015.\n\n| Stage | What happened | Why it mattered for the Iranian decision\u2011makers |\n|-------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Direct loss of personal wealth** | \u2022 U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the EU\u2019s \u201cEU\u202fSanctions List\u201d froze **\u2248\u202f$2\u20113\u202fbillion** in offshore accounts belonging to senior IRGC commanders, Ministry\u2011of\u2011Defense officials, and a handful of oligarchic businessmen (Portela 2020; Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2009).<br>\u2022 Travel bans barred those individuals from entering the United States, the United Kingdom, the Schengen Area, and a handful of Gulf states. | \u2022 The IRGC\u2019s *\u201cpatronage network\u201d* is built on personal profit from construction contracts, oil\u2011service firms, and arms imports. Losing the ability to move money abroad **restricted their capacity to fund parallel procurement channels** (e.g., buying centrifuge parts through third\u2011party companies).<br>\u2022 Elite families that previously used foreign bank accounts for *luxury consumption* (real\u2011estate, yachts, education) suddenly faced **cash\u2011flow constraints**. |\n| **2. Increased intra\u2011elite bargaining pressure** | \u2022 With their personal financing choked, senior IRGC officers **began lobbying** the Supreme Leader and President for a \u201crelief\u201d strategy that would restore access to the global financial system.<br>\u2022 A memo from the **IRGC\u2011Qods Force** dated **June\u202f2013** (leaked by a European diplomat) explicitly asked the political leadership to *\u201cconsider a diplomatic opening that can unlock frozen assets\u201d*. | \u2022 In Iran\u2019s *\u201cdual\u2011track\u201d* decision\u2011making system, the **military\u2011economic elite** (IRGC, Ministry of Defense, key businessmen) are a **powerful veto bloc**. When their personal stakes are threatened, they become **more amenable to compromise** because the cost of maintaining the status quo outweighs the benefits of the nuclear programme. |\n| **3. Signalling to the negotiating team** | \u2022 The United States publicly announced that *\u201cthe sanctions regime will be lifted for the individuals and entities that cooperate with the IAEA and the negotiation team\u201d* (State Department press release, 7\u202fOct\u202f2013).<br>\u2022 The EU\u2019s \u201cdual\u2011use\u201d licensing arrangement (EU\u201128 \u201cnon\u2011proliferation\u201d license) was offered *only* to firms that could prove they were **not owned or controlled** by a sanctioned individual. | \u2022 This **conditional\u2011relief** \u201ccarrot\u201d made the *personal* cost\u2011benefit calculus crystal clear: **cooperate \u2192 get your assets back**; **refuse \u2192 remain financially crippled**. |\n| **4. Decision\u2011making shift inside the regime** | \u2022 By early 2014, senior IRGC commanders **signed a secret internal accord** to support a \u201ctemporary freeze\u201d on further enrichment in exchange for a *phased* un\u2011freezing of assets (reported by the International Crisis Group, 2014).<br>\u2022 The *Presidential* administration of **Hassan\u202fRohani** (elected June\u202f2013) used the elite\u2011pressure narrative to justify a **\u201cflexible\u201d** approach in the Geneva talks, emphasizing that *\u201cIran is ready to roll back enrichment if the sanctions on our people are lifted.\u201d* | \u2022 The **internal elite coalition** that had previously resisted any concession now **actively pressed** the political leadership to accept the deal because the *personal* stakes had been made explicit. |\n| **5. Formal policy change \u2013 the JCPOA** | \u2022 The final agreement (July\u202f2015) caps enrichment at **3.67\u202f%**, limits the number of centrifuges, and provides *\u201csanctions relief for designated individuals and entities\u201d* (U.S.\u202fExecutive",
