Spores of *Clostridium* and *Bacillus* can survive HTST but are inactivated by higher\u2011temperature UHT or by subsequent refrigeration and acidic conditions.\n\n**Key point:** Pasteurization is **not** a sterilization step; it dramatically reduces the *viable* microbial load, especially the pathogens most commonly associated with food\u2011borne illness.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The only measurable nutrient losses are modest reductions in a few heat\u2011sensitive vitamins, which are far too small to affect overall diet quality for a person who eats a varied diet.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The chemistry behind the stability\n\n1. **Proteins** \u2013 Milk proteins are composed of long chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds that require temperatures >\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C for hydrolysis. The HTST pasteurisation curve (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) is far below the denaturation temperature of casein (\u2248\u202f140\u202f\u00b0C) and only mildly unfolds whey proteins. The amino\u2011acid composition (the \u201cnutrient\u201d part) stays the same; only the shape changes, which can even improve digestibility.\n\n2. **Fats** \u2013 Triglycerides are chemically stable up to at least 120\u202f\u00b0C for short periods. Oxidation (which would create off\u2011flavors) does increase slightly with heat, but the short exposure in pasteurisation does not measurably change the fatty\u2011acid profile.\n\n3. **Minerals** \u2013 Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc, etc., are inorganic ions. Heat does not",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nPasteurisation is a brief, controlled heat\u2011treatment (usually 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201chigh\u2011temperature\u2011short\u2011time\u201d or HTST \u2013 or 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin \u2013 \u201clow\u2011temperature\u2011long\u2011time\u201d \u2013 LTLT).  The temperature is high enough to kill disease\u2011causing microbes but low enough, and applied for a short enough time, that the bulk of milk\u2019s macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, fat) and most vitamins remain chemically unchanged.  One of the best\u2011studied nutrients that stays essentially the same is **casein protein** (the major milk protein).\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based breakdown.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How pasteurisation works (the physics/chemistry)\n\n| Step | Typical parameters | What the heat does |\n|------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| **HTST (most common in the U.S./EU)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs, then rapid cooling to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C | Causes **thermal denaturation** of bacterial enzymes and membrane proteins \u2192 cell death. The brief exposure limits the time available for chemical reactions that could break down milk components. |\n| **LTLT (used for \u201cbatch\u2011pasteurised\u201d or \u201clow\u2011temperature\u201d milk)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin, then cooling | Same principle, but the longer time slightly increases the chance of heat\u2011labile changes (e.g., some vitamin loss). |\n| **Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temperature (UHT)** \u2013 not asked for, but worth noting | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs, aseptic packaging | Destroys virtually *all* microbes, but does cause measurable changes in some nutrients and flavor compounds. |\n\nBecause the heat exposure is **short** and **moderate**, most covalent bonds in milk\u2019s major nutrients remain intact.  The main chemical processes that *can* happen during pasteurisation are:\n\n* **Denaturation of whey proteins** (\u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin, \u03b1\u2011lactalbumin) \u2013 they unfold but stay in solution; this can actually improve digestibility.\n* **Partial loss of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins** (especially vitamin\u202fC and some B\u2011vitamins) \u2013 typically <\u202f5\u202f% for HTST, up to ~\u202f15\u202f% for LTLT.\n* **Oxidation of some fatty acids** \u2013 negligible at pasteurisation temperatures; more of a concern with prolonged storage or high\u2011temperature UHT.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Nutrients that remain essentially unchanged\n\n| Nutrient | Why it is stable | Typical measured change (HTST) | Representative source |\n|----------|------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Casein (\u03b1\u2011, \u03b2\u2011, \u03ba\u2011casein)** \u2013 the bulk of milk protein (\u2248\u202f80\u202f% of total protein) | Casein micelles are **heat\u2011stable**; the protein\u2019s tertiary structure is already tightly packed and resistant to unfolding at 72\u202f\u00b0C. | <\u202f1\u202f% loss; no measurable change in amino\u2011acid profile. | *J.

For most people, the loss does **not** affect overall nutritional status because we obtain vitamin\u202fC from many other foods (citrus fruits, peppers, broccoli, etc.).\n\n#### 3. Why vitamin\u202fC is especially vulnerable  \n\n* **Water solubility** \u2013 Vitamin\u202fC dissolves in the aqueous phase of milk, where it can be exposed directly to heat.\n* **Oxidation** \u2013 Heat accelerates the oxidation of ascorbic acid to dehydro\u2011ascorbic acid, which is **not** counted as vitamin\u202fC in standard nutrient databases.\n* **pH sensitivity** \u2013 Milk\u2019s pH (~6.6) is close to the pH where ascorbic acid is most prone to degradation at elevated temperatures.\n\n#### 4. How manufacturers deal with the loss  \n\n1. **Fortification** \u2013 In many countries (U.S., Canada, EU), commercial milk is **fortified** with vitamin\u202fD, but **not** with vitamin\u202fC because the natural levels are already negligible. If a dairy product is marketed as \u201cvitamin\u2011C\u2011fortified\u201d (e.g., certain flavored milks or milk\u2011based smoothies), the added vitamin is typically introduced **after** pasteurisation, so the final product contains the intended amount.\n\n2. **Packaging & storage** \u2013 Light\u2011protective opaque containers and rapid cooling after pasteurisation help minimise further oxidative",
