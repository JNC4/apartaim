      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 what the evidence says about their ability to change a target\u2019s behaviour**\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most\u2011cited empirical work, the main case\u2011studies that scholars repeatedly invoke, and the methodological caveats that keep the debate lively.  Wherever possible I note the **type of sanction** (comprehensive vs. targeted, unilateral vs. multilateral, UN\u2011mandated vs. national) and the **outcome that researchers treat as \u201csuccess.\u201d**  The goal is to give you a balanced picture of what is well\u2011established, what remains contested, and where the evidence is still thin.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How success is measured\n\n| Outcome often called \u201csuccess\u201d | Typical operational definition in the literature |\n|---|---|\n| **Policy change** (e.g., abandonment of nuclear weapons, ending of a war) | A clear, documented shift in the target\u2019s official policy that the sanctioning coalition cites as the primary driver. |\n| **Compliance with a specific demand** (e.g., signing a treaty, allowing inspections) | Formal ratification, verification, or implementation of the demanded action. |\n| **Regime change** (e.g., overthrow of a leader) | Replacement of the target\u2019s government, usually within a defined time window (often 5\u202fyears). |\n| **Behavioural moderation** (e.g., reduced human\u2011rights violations) | Measurable decline in the specific conduct targeted by the sanctions, as recorded by NGOs or UN bodies. |\n| **No\u2011change / \u201cfailure\u201d** | The target continues the contested behaviour, or the sanctions are lifted without the demanded change. |\n\n> **Important nuance** \u2013 many scholars argue that \u201csuccess\u201d should be judged *relative to the original goal* and the *counterfactual* (what would have happened without sanctions).  This is why success rates differ across studies.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Aggregate success rates from the most\u2011cited datasets\n\n| Study (sample) | Time period | Type of sanctions covered | Reported success rate* |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* | 1914\u20112005 (\u2248 300 cases) | Mostly **comprehensive** (trade embargoes, financial freezes) and **multilateral** (UN, EU, US\u2011led coalitions) | **\u2248\u202f34\u202f%** led to the demanded policy change (or a negotiated settlement). |\n| **Kaempfer & Lowenberg (1999)** \u2013 *The Political Economy of Economic Sanctions* | 1970\u20111995 (\u2248 140 cases) | Primarily **UN\u2011mandated** and **U.S. unilateral** comprehensive sanctions | **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** success, with higher rates when sanctions were *multilateral* and *targeted at elite assets*. |\n| **Drezner (2011, 2019)** \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox* & *The Political Economy of Sanctions* | 1990\u20112014 (\u2248 100 cases) | Focus on **targeted (smart) sanctions** (asset freezes, travel bans) | **\u2248\u202f45",

How scholars define and measure \u201csuccess\u201d\n\n| Dimension | Typical definition | Why it matters for measurement |\n|-----------|--------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Policy change** | The target adopts the specific behavior the sanction\u2011imposer demands (e.g., halting nuclear enrichment, ending support for a rebel group). | Most studies treat this as the primary goal of coercive sanctions. |\n| **Regime change** | The incumbent government is replaced (by internal or external forces). | Frequently cited in the popular press, but rarely the *explicit* objective of the sanction\u2011imposing state. |\n| **Signaling / normative impact** | The target\u2019s international reputation shifts, or the sanction\u2011imposer signals resolve to other actors. | Hard to quantify; often assessed through diplomatic statements or voting patterns in international fora. |\n| **Compliance without concession** | The target complies with procedural demands (e.g., allowing inspections) while keeping the substantive policy. | Some scholars count this as a \u201cpartial success.\u201d |\n| **Unintended outcomes** | Humanitarian harm, rally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag effects, increased illicit trade. | Important for evaluating *overall* efficacy, even if the primary policy goal is met. |\n\n> **Consensus point** \u2013 The literature agrees that any assessment of success must be *goal\u2011specific* and *time\u2011bounded*; a sanction that forces a short\u2011term concession may later be reversed, and a sanction that never changes policy may still achieve a signaling purpose.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The campaign was coordinated through the **International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa** (1984\u20111990). | Studies (e.g., **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott 1990**; **Peksen 2019**) find that *multilateral* sanctions raise the cost of non\u2011compliance for the target because the government cannot \u201cshop around\u201d for friendly partners. |\n| **Clear demand** | **\u201cFull dismantling of the apartheid system and transition to a democratic, non\u2011racial government.\u201d**  The demand was articulated in the 1985 **U.S. Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act** and repeatedly reinforced in UN resolutions. | When the objective is *unambiguous* and *public*, the target can be held accountable and domestic opponents have a rallying point (see **Drezner 2011**). |\n| **Domestic political context** | \u2022 **Economic recession** in South Africa (GDP fell \u2248\u202f5\u202f% per year 1986\u20111991).  <br>\u2022 **Capital flight** \u2013 foreign direct investment dropped from US\u202f$10\u202fbn (1979) to <US\u202f$2\u202fbn (1990).  <br>\u2022 **Mass protests** (e.g., 1989 nationwide strikes) and increasing violence between the security forces and anti\u2011apartheid movements. | The sanctions *amplified* pre\u2011existing internal pressures.  **Sullivan (2008)** argues that sanctions are most effective when they \u201c*create a cost\u2011benefit calculus*\u201d for the ruling elite that aligns with domestic opposition. |\n| **Elite division** | The **National Party** (NP) and its business allies began to split: some (e.g., **Johann Rupert**, head of the Anglo\u2011American conglomerate) pushed for reform to protect profit; others (hard\u2011liners) feared loss of power.
