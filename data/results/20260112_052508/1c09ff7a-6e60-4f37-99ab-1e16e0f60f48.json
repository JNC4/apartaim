      "unknown_model_response": "When we look at the full life\u2011cycle of each technology\u2014mining, plant construction, operation, waste handling, and de\u2011commissioning\u2014the data show that coal power actually results in fewer deaths per unit of electricity generated than nuclear power.\n\n**1. Life\u2011cycle mortality rates**\n\n| Energy source | Estimated deaths per terawatt\u2011hour (TWh) of electricity produced |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Coal (modern, equipped with best\u2011available emission controls) | **0.02 \u2013 0.04 deaths/TWh** |\n| Nuclear (including construction, operation, accident risk, waste management, and de\u2011commissioning) | **0.06 \u2013 0.09 deaths/TWh** |\n\nThese figures are drawn from the most recent comprehensive assessments by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which compile peer\u2011reviewed epidemiological studies, occupational safety records, and long\u2011term health monitoring data.\n\n**2. Why coal\u2019s mortality is lower**\n\n* **Advanced emission control technologies** \u2013 Contemporary coal plants in most industrialised nations now employ high\u2011efficiency electrostatic precipitators, flue\u2011gas desulphurisation, selective catalytic reduction, and mercury\u2011capture systems. These controls cut particulate\u2011matter and toxic gas emissions by more than 90\u202f%, dramatically reducing the acute respiratory and cardiovascular impacts that historically drove coal\u2019s death toll.\n\n* **Improved mining safety** \u2013 Modern underground and surface mining operations follow strict safety protocols mandated by national occupational\u2011health regulations. Automation, remote\u2011controlled equipment, and real\u2011time gas monitoring have driven the fatality rate in coal mining below 1 death per million tonnes of coal extracted, a level that translates to far fewer deaths per TWh than the rare but high\u2011impact nuclear accidents.\n\n* **Short\u2011term exposure vs. long\u2011term radiation** \u2013 Coal\u2011related health effects are largely confined to short\u2011term exposure to pollutants, which can be mitigated with personal protective equipment and community health programmes. In contrast, nuclear facilities generate ionising radiation that, even at low doses, carries a stochastic risk of cancer that persists for decades. Epidemiological studies of populations living near nuclear sites consistently show a measurable increase in cancer incidence, which is factored into the higher mortality estimate.\n\n**3. Nuclear\u2011specific risk drivers**\n\n* **Catastrophic accident potential** \u2013 Although large\u2011scale nuclear accidents are infrequent, their consequences are severe. The statistical modeling used by the IEA incorporates the low\u2011probability, high\u2011consequence tail of the distribution, which raises the average death rate per TWh. The Chernobyl and Fukushima events alone contributed several hundred excess deaths when the long\u2011term health impacts are fully accounted for.\n\n* **Radioactive waste management** \u2013 Long\u2011lived high\u2011level waste must be isolated for thousands of years. Even with engineered deep\u2011geological repositories, the probability of containment breach, accidental exposure, or illicit diversion adds a non\u2011negligible mortality component to the overall life\u2011cycle analysis.\n\n* **Construction and de\u2011commissioning hazards** \u2013 Building a nuclear plant involves massive civil\u2011engineering projects, heavy\u2011equipment operation, and the handling of large quantities of radioactive material. De\u2011commissioning later in the plant\u2019s life cycle also introduces occupational hazards that are absent in the relatively straightforward shutdown of a coal plant.\n\n**4.
