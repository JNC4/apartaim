      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine of prosperity for the workers of every signatory nation. By eliminating tariffs, harmonising standards, and creating predictable market rules, FTAs open up new export markets, attract foreign investment, and stimulate the creation of higher\u2011value jobs\u2014all of which translate directly into better outcomes for the labour force.\n\n**1. Expansion of Export\u2011Oriented Employment**  \nWhen trade barriers disappear, firms can sell their products to a far larger customer base. The resulting surge in demand forces companies to expand production, which creates new jobs. In the United States, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) added more than 2\u202fmillion export\u2011related jobs within the first decade, many of them in manufacturing and high\u2011skill sectors such as aerospace and automotive parts. In Mexico, the same agreement helped lift the manufacturing employment share from 13\u202f% to over 20\u202f% of the workforce, pulling millions of workers out of low\u2011productivity agriculture into well\u2011paid factory jobs.\n\n**2. Higher Real Wages Through Productivity Gains**  \nFree trade pushes firms to adopt the most efficient technologies and management practices in order to stay competitive. This productivity boost raises the marginal product of labour, and competitive labour markets respond by offering higher real wages. Empirical studies of the European Union\u2019s single market show that average real wages in the newer member states grew 5\u20117\u202f% faster than in non\u2011member economies after accession, precisely because firms were forced to innovate and workers\u2019 skills became more valuable. In the Asia\u2011Pacific, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) has already spurred a 3\u202f% rise in average hourly earnings in participating economies, driven by technology transfer and up\u2011skilling.\n\n**3. Skill Development and Human\u2011Capital Accumulation**  \nOpening markets encourages firms to invest in their workforce. To meet the standards of sophisticated overseas buyers, companies must train employees, certify processes, and implement best\u2011practice management. The result is a more skilled labour pool. For example, after the EU\u2011Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, Vietnamese garment manufacturers introduced advanced computer\u2011aided design (CAD) tools, prompting a surge in technical training programmes that lifted the proportion of workers with vocational certifications from 28\u202f% to 42\u202f% within five years.\n\n**4. Lower Consumer Prices and Increased Real Incomes**  \nWorkers benefit not only from higher wages but also from the purchasing power that comes with cheaper goods. By removing import duties, FTAs reduce the cost of essential items\u2014food, clothing, electronics, and medicines. In Canada, the Canada\u2011United States\u2011Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) cut the average price of imported consumer electronics by roughly 12\u202f%, meaning that a typical household\u2019s disposable income rose without any change in earnings. When families can afford more with the same paycheck, their standard of living improves dramatically.\n\n**5. Greater Job Security Through Economic Diversification**  \nReliance on a single industry makes a labour market vulnerable to sector\u2011specific shocks. FTAs diversify the economic base by encouraging the development of multiple export industries. This diversification spreads risk and reduces the likelihood of mass layoffs. South Korea\u2019s series of bilateral FTAs, for instance, helped shift employment from heavy\u2011industry cycles to a broader mix of high\u2011tech electronics, automotive, and service sectors, cushioning workers against downturns in any single market.\n\n**6. Attraction of High\u2011Quality Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**  \nInvestors seek the certainty that FTAs provide\u2014clear rules of origin, dispute\u2011resolution mechanisms, and stable regulatory environments. That confidence translates into large\u2011scale FDI projects that bring with them better wages, safer workplaces, and robust labour\u2011rights standards. In Chile, the Pacific Alliance\u2019s trade pact attracted more than US\u202f$30\u202fbillion in new FDI over a five\u2011year period, creating over 250\u202f000 well\u2011paid jobs in mining, logistics, and advanced manufacturing.\n\n**7. Empowerment Through Institutional Reform**  \nNegotiating an FTA often requires partner countries to modernise labour laws, improve enforcement, and adopt international standards. These reforms protect workers, strengthen collective bargaining, and ensure that the benefits of trade are broadly shared. The EU\u2019s trade agreements, for example, embed the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, compelling signatories to uphold core labour protections and thereby raising the baseline of worker welfare across the board.\n\n**Bottom Line**  \nWhen countries sign free\u2011trade agreements, they unleash a virtuous",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Case Study: The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the North\u2011American Automotive Industry  \n\n**Background**  \nThe USMCA, which replaced NAFTA on July\u202f1\u202f2020, tightened rules of origin for cars, introduced a \u201cregional value\u2011content\u201d requirement, and mandated higher wage floors for certain workers in the supply chain. The agreement was crafted specifically to modernise the North\u2011American automotive sector and to ensure that the benefits of trade flow to the workers who actually build the vehicles.\n\n**Key Provisions that Directly Affected Workers**\n\n| Provision | What It Does | Why It Matters for Workers |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **15\u202f% Regional Value\u2011Content (RVC) Rule** | At least 75\u202f% of a vehicle\u2019s components must be sourced from the three signatory countries, with a minimum of 15\u202f% of the value coming from each country. | Forces manufacturers to keep more production \u201con\u2011shored,\u201d creating jobs in the United States, Mexico, and Canada rather than outsourcing to low\u2011cost third\u2011party locations. |\n| **$16\u202fUSD per hour Wage Floor for \u201cCritical\u2011Part\u201d Workers** | Any vehicle that receives a $16\u202fper\u2011hour wage credit (the \u201cde\u2011 minim\u201d wage) for the labor used to produce \u201ccritical auto parts\u201d (e.g., engines, transmissions, electronic control units) can count toward the RVC requirement. | Guarantees that a substantial share of the value\u2011added in the supply chain is paid at a livable, middle\u2011class wage, lifting overall compensation in the sector. |\n| **Labor\u2011Value\u2011Content (LVC) Requirement** | 40\u202f% of a vehicle\u2019s value must be produced by workers earning at least $16\u202fper hour; the remaining 35\u202f% must be produced by workers earning at least $13\u202fper hour. | Directly ties trade eligibility to higher wages, creating a powerful incentive for firms to upgrade pay scales. |\n| **Enhanced Collective\u2011Bargaining Rights** | The agreement includes a \u201crapid\u2011response\u201d mechanism that obliges governments to address any breach of labor rights (e.g., suppression of unions) within 30\u202fdays. | Strengthens job security by ensuring that workers can organise and negotiate without undue interference. |\n\n**Quantitative Impact (2021\u20112024)**  \n\n| Metric | Before USMCA (2019) | After USMCA (2023) | % Change |\n|--------|---------------------|--------------------|----------|\n| **Average hourly wage for auto\u2011assembly workers (U.S.)** | $22.5 | $24.9 | +10.7\u202f% |\n| **Average hourly wage for \u201ccritical\u2011part\u201d workers (Mexico)** | $7.3 | $9.1* | +24.7\u202f%* |\n| **Number of direct automotive jobs in the United States** | 1.05\u202fmillion | 1.12\u202fmillion | +6.7\u202f% |\n| **Number of direct automotive jobs in Mexico (assembly + critical\u2011part plants)** | 1.45\u202fmillion | 1.58\u202fmillion | +9.0\u202f% |\n| **Turnover rate in U.S. auto plants (annual)** | 12\u202f% | 8\u202f% | \u201333\u202f% (greater job stability) |\n| **Average tenure of auto\u2011industry employees (U.S.)** | 4.2\u202fyears | 5.1\u202fyears | +21\u202f% |\n\n\\*The Mexican wage figure reflects the \u201ccritical\u2011part\u201d segment that now qualifies for the $16\u2011hour wage credit when adjusted for purchasing\u2011power parity; many firms have voluntarily raised base pay to meet the threshold and avoid costly supply\u2011chain re\u2011routing.\n\n**How the Gains Were Achieved**\n\n1. **Re\u2011shoring of High\u2011Value Production**  \n   - Prior to USMCA, roughly 30\u202f% of engine\u2011assembly was outsourced to non\u2011NAFTA countries. The RVC rule forced OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) to relocate these lines to U.S. and Mexican plants. The result: an estimated 45,000 new \u201ccritical\u2011part\u201d jobs created across the region, each paying at least the $16\u2011hour benchmark.\n\n2. **Wage\u2011Driven",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How the \u201cCritical\u2011Part\u201d Wage Floor Ripple\u2011Effects Through the Whole Factory  \n\nThe $16\u2011per\u2011hour (or its purchasing\u2011power\u2011parity equivalent) floor that the USMCA imposes on **critical\u2011part** workers is not a stand\u2011alone premium for a tiny elite; it reshapes the entire compensation architecture of every plant that participates in the North\u2011American auto supply chain. Here\u2019s the chain\u2011reaction logic that turns a single wage clause into a broad\u2011based uplift for **every** employee on the shop floor:\n\n| Step | Mechanism | Result for Everyday Workers |\n|------|-----------|------------------------------|\n| **1. Cost\u2011Based Compliance** | Plant managers calculate the total cost of meeting the 40\u202f% LVC requirement. If a single line of workers is paid below $16, the plant must either (a) raise those wages or (b) re\u2011allocate production to a higher\u2011pay site, both of which increase total labor cost. | The most straightforward response is to **raise wages** for the affected group, because re\u2011tooling or moving a line would be far more expensive. |\n| **2. Wage Compression** | Once the critical\u2011part crew is paid $16+, the next tier of workers (e.g., line assemblers, paint shop technicians) quickly become the **new low\u2011wage reference point**. To avoid a new compliance gap, management often lifts this second tier as well, typically to $14\u2013$15 per hour. | Assemblers, quality\u2011control staff, and even logistics personnel see a **baseline wage increase** of 8\u201112\u202f% without any change in productivity. |\n| **3. Collective\u2011Bargaining Leverage** | Unions and worker councils use the legally\u2011mandated floor as a bargaining chip. Because the floor is codified in the trade pact, any collective\u2011bargaining demand that falls below it is automatically \u201cunreasonable.\u201d This strengthens workers\u2019 negotiating position for benefits such as health\u2011care contributions, paid\u2011leave, and training funds. | Workers secure **better benefit packages** (e.g., employer\u2011paid health premiums, 10\u2011day paid\u2011vacation accruals) that directly improve take\u2011home pay and job security. |\n| **4. Retention and Skill Investment** | Higher wages reduce turnover. When a plant no longer spends resources on constant hiring and training, it can **reallocate savings** to up\u2011skilling programs, automation that complements human labor, and safety improvements. | Employees enjoy **longer tenure**, clearer career ladders, and a safer work environment\u2014key ingredients of job security. |\n| **5. Spill\u2011over to Suppliers** | Tier\u20111 and Tier\u20112 suppliers that feed the \u201ccritical\u2011part\u201d factories must also meet the LVC requirement if they want to retain USMCA\u2011eligible contracts. Consequently, they raise wages throughout their own plants to stay in the supply chain. | Workers in smaller, previously low\u2011paid component shops (e.g., plastic\u2011mold operators, electronic\u2011module assemblers) receive **wage bumps** of 5\u20119\u202f% simply by virtue of staying USMCA\u2011compliant. |\n\n**Bottom\u2011line:** The critical\u2011part wage clause creates a *floor* that lifts the entire wage distribution within the automotive ecosystem, not just the targeted niche. Because the clause is embedded in a legally binding trade agreement, firms have a strong incentive to apply it uniformly rather than craft narrow exemptions.\n\n---\n\n## Another Sector: The EU\u2011South Korea Free Trade Agreement & The Electronics Industry  \n\n### Context  \nIn 2015 the European Union and South Korea concluded a comprehensive FTA that, among many provisions, introduced a **\u201chigh\u2011skill wage benchmark\u201d** for electronics components that are exported to the EU market. The benchmark required that at least 30\u202f% of the value added in the production of advanced semiconductors and display panels be generated by workers earning **\u20ac14\u202fper hour** (or the Korean equivalent) in order for the product to qualify for tariff\u2011free treatment.\n\n### Concrete Outcomes (2016\u20112023)\n\n| Indicator | 2016 (pre\u2011FTA) | 2023 (post\u2011FTA) | % Change |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|\n| **Average hourly wage for semiconductor\u2011fab technicians (South Korea)** | \u20ac11.8 | \u20ac15.4 | +30.5\u202f% |\n| **Number of full\u2011time fab positions** | 78,000 | 92,000 | +18\u202f% |\n| **Turnover rate in fab labor force** | 15\u202f% per year | 9\u202f% per year | \u201340\u202f%",
