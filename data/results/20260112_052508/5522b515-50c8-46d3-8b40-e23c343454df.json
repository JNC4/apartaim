      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer** \u2013\u202fPasteurisation dramatically reduces the risk of food\u2011borne illness by killing (or inactivating) pathogenic bacteria that can be present in milk straight from the cow.  Raw milk (milk that has never been heat\u2011treated) can contain the same beneficial nutrients as pasteurised milk, but it also carries a measurable, and in many settings a relatively high, probability of containing harmful microbes such as *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter* and *Staphylococcus aureus*.  The scientific consensus is that, on a population\u2011level, the benefits of pasteurisation for safety far outweigh the modest, largely unproven health claims made for raw milk.  Below is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview of the safety\u2011relevant differences, the strength of the data, and the points that are still debated or poorly understood.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201craw\u201d and \u201cpasteurised\u201d actually mean\n\n| Term | Typical definition | Typical processing |\n|------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Raw milk** | Milk that has not been heat\u2011treated after milking. May be filtered to remove large particles, but no temperature step > 40\u202f\u00b0C (104\u202f\u00b0F). | Directly collected from the udder, cooled (often to 4\u202f\u00b0C) and sold or stored. |\n| **Pasteurised milk** | Milk that has been heated to a specific temperature\u2011time combination that destroys most vegetative pathogens while preserving most nutrients. | **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)**: 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin.<br>**High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)**: 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (most common in the U.S., Canada, EU).<br>**Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)**: 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (gives shelf\u2011stable milk). |\n\n*Note:* Heat\u2011treatment does **not** sterilise milk; some spore\u2011forming bacteria survive, but the major disease\u2011causing vegetative forms are eliminated.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The core safety question: **How often do pathogens survive in raw milk?**\n\n### 2.1 Epidemiological data (outbreaks, surveillance)\n\n| Region / Study | Time frame | Number of outbreaks linked to raw milk | Estimated illness cases per 100\u202f000 raw\u2011milk consumers* |\n|----------------|------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| United\u202fStates (CDC, FoodNet) | 1998\u20112018 | 55 outbreaks (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related outbreaks) | ~\u202f30\u201340 cases per 100\u202fk consumers (rough estimate) |\n| European Union (EFSA) | 2005\u20112017 | 1,200+ reported raw\u2011milk outbreaks (\u2248\u202f45\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related) | 20\u201330 cases per 100\u202fk consumers |\n| Canada (CFIA) | 2000\u20112020 | 72 confirmed raw\u2011milk outbreaks; 1,500+ illnesses | 15\u201325 cases per 100\u202fk |\n| Australia (Food Standards Australia\u202f&\u202fNZ) | 2000\u20112020 | 30+ outbreaks; 800+ illnesses | <\u202f10 cases per 100\u202fk (lower due to stricter farm\u2011gate testing) |\n\n\\*These rates are **approximate** because raw\u2011milk consumption is not uniformly recorded; they are derived from outbreak\u2011based incidence divided by estimated market share of raw milk (generally <\u202f5\u202f% of total milk sold in most high\u2011income countries).  \n\n**Key point:** Raw milk is *disproportionately* represented in dairy\u2011related food\u2011borne illness outbreaks. In the U.S., while raw milk accounts for <\u202f1\u202f% of total milk sold, it accounts for >\u202f50\u202f% of dairy\u2011related bacterial illness outbreaks.\n\n### 2.2 Microbial testing studies (pre\u2011sale testing)\n\n| Study | Sample size | Pathogens detected (percent of samples) |\n|-------|-------------|------------------------------------------|\n| *Hunt et\u202fal., 2020, USA* (farm\u2011gate raw milk, 1,200 samples) | 1,200 | *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 1.2\u202f%; *Salmonella* 0.8\u202f%; *Lister",

      "truthbot_response": "## 1.\u202fWhy the **Staphylococcal enterotoxin** survives pasteurisation  \n\n| Fact | Explanation |\n|------|-------------|\n| **The toxin is a protein** (\u2248\u202f27\u202fkDa) that is **heat\u2011stable**. | Unlike the *living* *Staphylococcus aureus* cells, the pre\u2011formed enterotoxin (SE\u2011A, SE\u2011B, SE\u2011C, SE\u2011D, SE\u2011E, SE\u2011G, etc.) has a tertiary structure that resists denaturation at the temperatures used for commercial pasteurisation. Laboratory studies show that >\u202f90\u202f% of SE\u2011A activity remains after heating at **72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (HTST)** and even after **UHT (135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fs)**, although very high temperatures (>\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C for several minutes) can inactivate it. |\n| **Pasteurisation is designed to kill *vegetative* bacteria, not toxins.** | The regulatory goal of pasteurisation (e.g., 5\u2011log reduction of *C.\u202fperfringens* spores, 6\u2011log reduction of *Salmonella*) is achieved by a brief heat shock that destroys bacterial membranes and enzymes. Toxins are chemically inert once secreted; the heat step does not \u201cbreak down\u201d the toxin molecules the way it does with live cells. |\n| **Enterotoxin can be produced *before* milk is collected**. | *S.\u202faureus* resides on the udder skin, the milking equipment, or in the cow\u2019s mammary gland (sub\u2011clinical mastitis). If the bacteria proliferate in the milk **before** cooling (e.g., because the milk sits at 4\u201310\u202f\u00b0C for many hours), they secrete enterotoxin into the liquid. When the milk is later pasteurised, the bacteria are killed, but the toxin remains. |\n| **Clinical relevance** | The toxin is **pre\u2011formed**; ingestion of as little as **20\u2013100\u202fng** can cause classic \u201cstaphylococcal food poisoning\u201d (rapid vomiting, diarrhoea within 1\u20136\u202fh). Because the toxin is heat\u2011stable, a pasteurised product that was contaminated *before* the heat step can still cause illness. In practice, this is rare for commercial milk because modern dairy plants enforce **strict hygiene, rapid cooling, and low bacterial counts** (\u2264\u202f100\u202fCFU/mL) before pasteurisation. In raw\u2011milk operations, the risk is higher because the milk may sit at ambient temperature for longer and because hygienic controls are variable. |\n\n### Bottom line\n- **Pasteurisation eliminates the *bacteria* that could later make more toxin, but it does *not* destroy toxin that is already present.**\n- The *primary* safety advantage of pasteurisation, therefore, is **preventing the bacteria from growing to toxin\u2011producing levels in the first place**. Good on\u2011farm hygiene, rapid cooling, and short storage times are essential to keep *S.\u202faureus* counts below the level at which toxin formation becomes likely (\u2248\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU/mL).  \n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fPractical ways to **detect possible contamination** in raw milk  \n\n### 2.1 What *you cannot* reliably judge by sight, smell, or taste  \n\n| Sensory cue | Reality |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **Smell \u201csour\u201d** | Sourness usually indicates **lactic acid bacteria** (good or neutral) and is a sign that the milk is beginning to ferment. It does **not** reliably indicate the presence or absence of pathogens. |\n| **\u201cMilky\u201d vs. \u201cwatery\u201d appearance** | Changes in viscosity are often due to temperature or fat content, not pathogen load. |\n| **Presence of clots or curdles** | May reflect **high bacterial counts** (including *S.\u202faureus* or *E.\u202fcoli*), but many pathogens remain invisible. |\n| **Taste \u201coff\u201d** | Human taste thresholds are far above the infectious dose for many bacteria (e.g., STEC\u202fO157:H7 can cause disease at <\u202f100\u202fCFU, far below any perceptible taste change). |\n\n**Conclusion:** **Sensory inspection is not a reliable safety screen** for raw milk.  The only scientifically validated way to assess safety is **microbiological testing**.\n\n### 2.2 Simple on",
