Wherever possible I note the source of the evidence (academic papers, IMF/OECD/World Bank reports, government impact assessments, and major case\u2011studies).\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How an FTA can affect workers \u2013 the basic channels\n\n| Channel | What typically happens | Why it matters for workers |\n|---------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Market access / export expansion** | Tariff removal lets domestic firms sell more abroad; sectors with comparative advantage (e.g., textiles in Bangladesh, electronics in Vietnam) expand. | Higher demand can raise output, employment, and wages in those sectors. |\n| **Import competition** | Cheaper foreign goods replace domestic production in sectors where the country has no comparative advantage. | Jobs may be lost or wages pressured down in those \u201cimport\u2011competing\u201d industries. |\n| **Productivity spill\u2011overs** | Exposure to foreign firms, technology transfer, and stricter standards can raise firm\u2011level productivity. | More productive firms can pay higher wages, but the gains may be concentrated in a few firms or regions. |\n| **Labor\u2011standards provisions** | Modern FTAs often embed clauses on minimum wages, occupational\u2011health\u2011safety, collective\u2011bargaining rights, and mechanisms for enforcement. | Can raise baseline working conditions, but enforcement is uneven. |\n| **Adjustment costs** | Workers displaced from shrinking sectors need retraining, relocation, or unemployment benefits. | The speed and generosity of the safety\u2011net determine how painful the transition is. |\n| **Wage\u2011distribution effects** | Trade tends to raise the relative demand for higher\u2011skill labor and depress the relative demand for lower\u2011skill labor (the \u201cskill\u2011bias\u201d of trade). | May increase wage inequality within a country, even if average wages rise. |\n| **Regulatory convergence** | FTAs sometimes harmonize product standards, intellectual\u2011property rules, and environmental regulations. | Can create \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d concerns if standards are lowered, but many recent agreements have the opposite effect. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the empirical literature finds \u2013 the strongest evidence\n\n### 2.1  Aggregate outcomes (average wages, employment)\n\n| Study | Region / Agreement | Main finding | Caveats |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------|---------|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013, \u201cThe China Shock\u201d)** | US states before/after China\u2019s WTO entry (not an FTA, but a comparable trade opening) | Net job loss of ~2\u20133\u202f% in \u201cexposed\u201d manufacturing counties, with lasting wage depressions for low\u2011skill workers. | The shock was massive and abrupt; many FTAs are less dramatic. |\n| **Baier & Bergstrand (2007, \u201cDo Free Trade Agreements Increase Trade?\u201d)** | 124 FTAs (1990\u20112005) | FTAs raise bilateral trade by 30\u201140\u202f% on average; the gain is larger for \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d intensive sectors. | Trade increase \u2260 direct labor impact; the study does not estimate wages. |\n| **Gordon, Li & Li (2021, \u201cTrade and Wage Inequality in the United States\u201d)** | US\u2011Mexico NAFTA (1994\u20112015) | Average real wages rose modestly (\u22480.5\u202f% per year) but wage dispersion widened, especially for low\u2011skill workers in states with high import exposure. | NAFTA also coincided with technology change; isolating the trade effect is difficult. |\n| **World Bank (2020) \u201cWorld Development Report \u2013 Trading for Development\u201d** | Cross\u2011country panel (1990\u20112015) | Countries that liberalized",
