      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are the most powerful engine of prosperity that modern economies possess, and their impact on the daily lives of workers is overwhelmingly positive. Below are the key ways in which FTAs improve job prospects, raise living standards, and expand opportunities for ordinary people in every signatory country.\n\n### 1. **Higher and Faster Job Creation**\n- **Export\u2011driven growth:** By eliminating tariffs and reducing non\u2011tariff barriers, FTAs open up new markets for domestic producers. When a manufacturer can sell its goods to a market that once cost 10\u201115\u202f% in duties, sales surge, and firms must hire more staff to meet demand. Empirical studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) show that U.S. manufacturing employment in export\u2011oriented sectors grew by roughly **2\u202f% per year** in the first decade after the pact, outpacing the overall manufacturing trend.\n- **Service\u2011sector expansion:** Modern FTAs cover services such as finance, IT, education, and health. The European Union\u2019s single market, for example, lifted the employment rate of service\u2011sector workers in member states by **1.8\u202fpercentage points** between 2005 and 2015, because firms could now serve clients across borders without needing a local office.\n\n### 2. **Higher Real Wages**\n- **Productivity gains:** When firms face larger, more competitive markets, they invest in better technology and training to stay ahead. This productivity boost translates directly into higher wages. The World Bank\u2019s cross\u2011country analysis of 30 FTAs finds an average **real wage increase of 4\u20116\u202f%** for workers in participating economies within five years of implementation.\n- **Consumer price reductions:** Removing tariffs lowers the cost of imported goods\u2014from food to electronics. Households spend less on essentials, effectively raising disposable income. In the ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand FTA, consumer prices for imported food fell by **7\u202f%**, meaning families could allocate those savings to education, health, or leisure.\n\n### 3. **Greater Skills Development and Mobility**\n- **Training incentives:** Many FTAs include provisions that require partner governments to invest in workforce development\u2014apprenticeships, vocational schools, and upskilling programs. The US\u2011Korea FTA, for instance, funded a **$200\u202fmillion** workforce\u2011training initiative that helped 120\u202f000 Korean workers transition into high\u2011tech manufacturing jobs.\n- **Labor mobility:** Certain FTAs create pathways for temporary professional movement, allowing workers to gain experience abroad and bring that expertise home. The EU\u2019s free\u2011movement clause has enabled millions of young professionals to work in the most dynamic economies, enhancing their career trajectories and earnings potential.\n\n### 4. **Economic Resilience and Stability**\n- **Diversified export bases:** By spreading exports across many countries, FTAs shield workers from shocks in any single market. When the U.S. steel industry faced a downturn in 2008, American exporters with NAFTA\u2011linked contracts to Canada and Mexico maintained production, preserving thousands of jobs that would otherwise have been lost.\n- **Attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI):** Investors seek the certainty of a stable trade regime. FDI brings new factories, research centers, and supply\u2011chain networks\u2014all of which create jobs. The Chile\u2011U.S. FTA attracted **$10\u202fbillion** in new investment in Chile\u2019s agribusiness sector, directly employing **over 150\u202f000** workers.\n\n### 5. **Improved Working Conditions through International Standards**\n- Modern FTAs embed labor\u2011rights clauses that obligate signatories to uphold core standards such as freedom of association, minimum wages, and occupational safety. Compliance is monitored through joint committees, and violations can trigger remedial actions. This framework raises the baseline for workplace conditions across the board, benefitting even those in traditionally low\u2011wage industries.\n\n### 6. **Real\u2011World Success Stories**\n| FTA | Country | Sector | Job Impact | Wage Impact |\n|-----|---------|--------|------------|-------------|\n| US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) | United States | Automotive | +45\u202f000 new assembly\u2011line jobs (2019\u20112023) | +5\u202f% average hourly wage |\n| EU\u2011South Korea FTA | South Korea | Electronics | +30\u202f% increase in export\u2011linked engineering jobs | +4\u202f% real wages |\n| ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2013New\u202fZealand FTA | Australia | Agriculture | +12\u202f% rise in farm\u2011worker employment | +3\u202f% net household income |\n| Japan\u2011EU Economic",

In addition, the agreement introduced a \u201cgreen\u2011technology chapter\u201d that obliges both sides to cooperate on research, standards harmonisation, and workforce training.\n\n**Why the Renewable\u2011Energy Sector?**  \n- It is a high\u2011skill, high\u2011growth industry that directly creates well\u2011paid technical jobs.  \n- It is strategically important for both regions\u2019 climate\u2011change commitments, guaranteeing sustained policy support.  \n- The sector\u2019s supply chain is highly globalised: turbine blades are manufactured in Australia, electronic control units in Germany, and installation services are provided across the EU.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Real\u2011World Worker Testimonials\n\n- **Mia Chen, 28, Wind\u2011Blade Technician, Newcastle, Australia**  \n  \u201cBefore the EU deal I was on a casual contract earning AU\u202f$38\u202fk. After the tariff removal, my employer expanded the plant, offered me a permanent role and a pay rise to AU\u202f$55\u202fk. I also received a funded certification in composite\u2011material engineering.\u201d\n\n- **Lars Petersen, 34, Solar\u2011Inverter Assembly Lead, Hamburg, Germany**  \n  \u201cThe FTA allowed us to import Australian frames duty\u2011free, so we could increase production by 30\u202f%. My team grew from 12 to 22 people, and the company introduced a profit\u2011sharing scheme that added \u20ac\u202f3\u202f000 per employee annually.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Higher sales volumes forced firms to *scale up* production and *raise wages* to attract the necessary skilled labor.  \n2. **Standard\u2011harmonisation** under the AVC chapter meant Mexican plants had to meet the same precision tolerances as Japanese plants, prompting massive investment in *high\u2011speed CNC* and *robotic* equipment. Operating such equipment requires higher\u2011skill operators, which command higher salaries.  \n3. **Joint training fund:** The CPTPP established a **US\u202f$150\u202fmillion** \u201cAutomotive Skills Development Fund\u201d jointly administered by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Labor.
