The chemistry \u2013 how fluoride gets into the tap\n\n| Fluoride source (commercial grade) | Chemical formula | Typical purity | How it is handled in a treatment plant |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Sodium fluoride (NaF)**         | NaF              | \u2265\u202f99\u202f%        | Dissolved in water to make a stock solution; pumped into the distribution system through a metered injection pump. |\n| **Sodium fluorosilicate (Na\u2082SiF\u2086)**| Na\u2082SiF\u2086          | \u2265\u202f99\u202f%        | Similar to NaF; often used where the plant already has a silica\u2011based dosing system. |\n| **Hydrofluorosilicic acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086)**| H\u2082SiF\u2086          | 30\u201135\u202f% HF (as H\u2082SiF\u2086) | Stored in acid\u2011resistant tanks; diluted on\u2011site and injected via a corrosion\u2011resistant pump. This is the most common additive in the United States because it is a cheap by\u2011product of phosphate fertilizer production. |\n\n**Key steps in a typical municipal plant**\n\n1. **Storage** \u2013 The fluoride compound is kept in a dedicated, clearly labelled, secondary containment tank. For acids, the tank is made of stainless steel or high\u2011density polyethylene and equipped with an overflow alarm.\n2. **Preparation of a dosing solution** \u2013 A measured amount of the solid (NaF, Na\u2082SiF\u2086) or concentrated acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086) is mixed with a known volume of potable water to create a \u201cstock\u201d solution of known fluoride concentration (e.g., 10\u202fmg\u202fF\u207b\u202fL\u207b\u00b9).\n3. **Metered injection** \u2013 A calibrated, often computer\u2011controlled, pump continuously injects the stock solution into the main water stream. The flow\u2011rate of the pump is proportional to the plant\u2019s raw\u2011water flow, so the final fluoride concentration stays within the target range despite daily demand fluctuations.\n4. **Mixing & residence time** \u2013 The water passes through a short mixing zone (usually a pipe or a small tank) to ensure uniform distribution of fluoride.\n5. **Monitoring** \u2013 Portable electrodes (ion\u2011selective electrode for fluoride) or laboratory analysis (ion chromatography) are used at least once a day (often hourly in larger systems) to confirm that the concentration remains within the prescribed limits. Results are logged and reported to the state health department.\n6. **Adjustment** \u2013 If the measured concentration drifts outside the target band, the pump\u2019s set\u2011point is altered automatically (in modern SCADA\u2011controlled plants) or manually by the operator.\n\n**Safety & quality controls**\n\n* **Redundancy:** Most plants have a backup pump and a second storage tank in case of failure.\n* **Operator training:** Personnel must be certified in handling hazardous chemicals (especially H\u2082SiF\u2086, which is a strong acid).\n* **Public notification:** In many jurisdictions, a notice is posted at the plant and on the utility\u2019s website whenever the fluoride level is adjusted outside the normal range (e.g., during emergencies).\n\n---\n\n### 2.
