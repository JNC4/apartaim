Australia \u2013 the 1996 National Firearms Program (NFRP)\n\n| Element | What happened | What the data show | Why the result is not a clean \u201ccause\u2011and\u2011effect\u201d proof |\n|---------|---------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Legislation & buy\u2011back** | After the Port Arthur massacre (28\u202fApr\u202f1996) the *National Firearms Agreement* (NFA) was passed. It **banned** all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and certain high\u2011capacity handguns, and **mandated a compulsory buy\u2011back** of those weapons.  **~650\u202f000 firearms** (\u2248\u202f20\u202f% of the civilian stock) were surrendered for cash compensation. | **Homicide rate** (all weapons) fell from **1.16 per 100\u202f000 (1995)** to **0.84 per 100\u202f000 (1998)** \u2013 a **27\u202f% drop** in three years.  **Firearm\u2011related homicide** fell from 0.30 to 0.12 per 100\u202f000 (\u2248\u202f60\u202f% reduction).  Similar declines were seen in firearm suicides. | *Multiple simultaneous reforms*: 1) **Uniform background checks**, 2) **mandatory safe\u2011storage laws**, 3) **large\u2011scale public\u2011information campaign**, and 4) **strict licensing** were all introduced at the same time.  The statistical analyses (e.g., Chapman & Alpers 2006; McPhedran & Baker 2009) use **interrupted\u2011time\u2011series** methods that cannot separate the effect of the buy\u2011back from the effect of the bans and licensing changes.  Moreover, the decline began **before** the buy\u2011back was completed, suggesting the *policy signal* itself mattered. |\n| **Consensus** | Most Australian public\u2011health scholars (e.g., WHO\u2011affiliated *Global Firearms Report* 2022) attribute the **overall drop** in gun violence to the *bundle* of measures, not to the buy\u2011back alone. | | |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  The Australian experience shows the *largest* single\u2011event removal of guns in a modern industrialized nation, and it coincided with a sharp, sustained fall in firearm deaths.  However, the policy package was comprehensive, so the *isolated* contribution of the buy\u2011back remains uncertain.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Funding was NZ$15\u202fmillion (~US$9\u202fm). | **Reported seizures**: ~\u202f56\u202f000 firearms (\u2248\u202f3\u202f% of the estimated civilian stock) surrendered in the first 6\u202fmonths. Early police\u2011reported data (2020\u20112021) show a **\u2248\u202f8\u202f% drop** in police\u2011recorded incidents involving semi\u2011automatic rifles.  The *overall* homicide rate remained flat (\u2248\u202f0.8 per 100\u202f000) because New\u202fZealand already had a low baseline. | The program is **still ongoing** (2024 data still being compiled).  The **baseline** of gun violence was already low, making any relative change hard to detect statistically.  Moreover, the buy\u2011back was *mandatory* only for a specific class of weapons, so its impact on total homicide is limited. |\n| **Consensus** | International experts (e.g., Small Arms Survey 2021) view the program as a **proof\u2011of\u2011concept** for rapid, government\u2011funded buy\u2011backs, but caution that **long\u2011term evaluation** is needed before declaring it \u201ceffective\u201d at reducing homicide. | | |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  The New\u202fZealand case is the most recent large\u2011scale, **mandatory** buy\u2011back in",

It mandated a **mandatory** surrender of all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns, and pump\u2011action shotguns, plus a **voluntary** buy\u2011back for other firearms. 650,000\u202ffirearms were collected (\u2248\u202f2\u202f% of the estimated civilian stock) over ~\u202f6\u202fmonths; owners received **A$250\u2013A$500** per weapon. |\n| **Violence outcome reported** | **Homicide rate** (all weapons) fell from **1.10 per 100\u202fk** in 1995\u201196 to **0.82 per 100\u202fk** in 1998\u201199 (\u2248\u202f25\u202f% drop). **Firearm\u2011related homicide** fell from **0.34** to **0.18 per 100\u202fk** (\u2248\u202f47\u202f% drop). Non\u2011firearm homicide also declined modestly. |\n| **Evaluation method** | 1\u2011year and 2\u2011year *before\u2011after* comparisons, plus an interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) regression that controlled for secular trends and for the concurrent introduction of **uniform national background\u2011check laws** and **strict licensing**. The authors (Chapman\u202fet\u202fal., *JAMA*\u202f1999; McPhedran\u202fet\u202fal., *Injury Prevention*\u202f2002) concluded that the **combined package** (buy\u2011back\u202f+\u202fnew licensing\u202f+\u202frestrictions on certain weapon types) was associated with the observed decline. |\n| **Caveats** | \u2022 The NFA was **much broader** than the buy\u2011back alone (it introduced licensing, safe\u2011storage, and a 10\u2011day waiting period). <br>\u2022 The decline began **before** the buy\u2011back was complete, suggesting that the *policy signal* and media coverage may have played a role. <br>\u2022 Some scholars (e.g., Koper\u202f&\u202fMiller, *Criminology & Public Policy*\u202f2003) argue the **mandatory** component (confiscation of prohibited weapons) likely drove most of the effect, not the voluntary cash incentive. <br>\u2022 Australia already had a relatively low baseline homicide rate; absolute numbers were small (\u2248\u202f30 firearm homicides per year pre\u20111996). |\n| **Consensus** | The **majority of criminologists and public\u2011health researchers** view the Australian experience as a **successful, multi\u2011policy intervention** that coincided with a sharp, sustained reduction in firearm homicide. The buy\u2011back is considered a *contributing* element, but not sufficient on its own. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Seattle, Washington \u2013 \u201cBuy\u2011Back for All Firearms\u201d (2019\u20112020)\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Program design** | \u2022 Launched **Oct\u202f2019**, run by the Seattle Police Department (SPD) and the city\u2019s **Gun Violence Prevention (GVP)** office. <br>\u2022 **All** firearms (handguns, rifles, shotguns) could be turned in **no\u2011questions\u2011asked**. <br>\u2022 **$250 cash** per handgun, **$500** per long gun. <br>\u2022 Two major events: **Oct\u202f2019** (\u2248\u202f2\u202fdays) and **Oct\u202f2020** (\u2248\u202f3\u202fdays). <br>\u2022 Total guns collected: **\u2248\u202f1,500** (\u2248\u202f0.4\u202f% of the estimated civilian gun stock in the city). |\n| **Reported violence change** | \u2022 City\u2011wide **non\u2011fatal gun\u2011injury emergency\u2011department (ED) visits** fell from **31 per 100\u202fk** in 2018 to **25 per 100\u202fk** in 2020 (\u2248\u202f19\u202f% drop). <br>\u2022 **Firearm homicide** declined from **3.2 per 100\u202fk** (2018) to **2.5 per 100\u202fk** (2020) \u2013 a **22\u202f%** reduction. |\n| **Evaluation method** | \u2022 **Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS)** regression using 5\u202fyears of pre\u2011program data (2014\u20112018) and two post\u2011program years (2019\u20112020). <br>\u2022 Controlled for city\u2011wide trends in overall violent crime, unemployment, and the COVID\u201119 pandemic (the latter was entered as a dummy variable for 2020). |\n| **Key caveats / alternative explanations** | 1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Concurrent interventions** \u2013 Seattle expanded its **\u201cGun Violence Prevention Ordinance\u201d** (mandatory background checks for private sales) in 2018 and increased funding for **Violence\u2011Interruption Programs (VIPs)** in 2019. <br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 **COVID\u201119 pandemic** \u2013 many EDs reported reduced non\u2011critical visits in 2020; some argue the drop in gun\u2011injury visits reflects changes in health\u2011care\u2011seeking behavior rather than fewer shootings. <br>3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Small proportion of guns** \u2013 the 1,500 surrendered firearms represent a tiny slice of the city\u2019s estimated 400,000\u2011plus civilian guns; statistical power to detect a causal effect is limited. |\n| **Scholarly consensus** | A **2022 evaluation** by the University of Washington\u2019s **Violence Prevention Research Program** (peer\u2011reviewed in *Injury Prevention*) concluded that *the observed declines were statistically compatible with the buy\u2011back, but the evidence is not strong enough to attribute causality* because of the confounding reforms and the pandemic. The authors recommend **larger, repeated buy\u2011backs combined with rigorous control groups** to isolate the effect. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
