      "unknown_model_response": "## The \u201cExcess\u2011Capacity\u201d Instrument in the Dezhbakhsh\u2011Rubin\u2011Shepherd Study  \n\n### 1. Why an Instrument Is Needed at All  \n\nWhen we ask **\u201cDoes the death penalty deter murder?\u201d** we run into a classic identification problem:\n\n| Problem | What it looks like in the data |\n|---------|--------------------------------|\n| **Endogeneity / reverse causality** | States (or counties) that experience a lot of murders are more likely to adopt the death penalty *and* to carry out more executions. If we simply regress homicide rates on the number of executions, the coefficient picks up the effect of the underlying crime wave, not the causal effect of the penalty. |\n| **Omitted\u2011variable bias** | Unobserved factors\u2014e.g., a tough\u2011on\u2011crime political climate, changes in police staffing, or a surge in drug markets\u2014can affect both the number of executions and murder rates. |\n| **Measurement error** | Execution data are small\u2011number events; a single execution can swing the rate dramatically, creating noisy estimates. |\n\nThe **instrumental\u2011variable (IV) strategy** tries to isolate a source of variation in executions that is *unrelated* to the underlying murder trend, but that still moves the execution count. If we can find such a source, we can treat it as a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d that mimics random assignment of the death penalty intensity.\n\n### 2. The Core Idea of \u201cExcess Capacity\u201d\n\n#### 2.1 What \u201ccapacity\u201d means  \n\n- **Legal capacity**: In a given jurisdiction (U.S. state, Mexican state, or a Mexican municipality in the original paper), the law determines **how many people can be sentenced to death**\u2014the \u201cdeath\u2011row quota.\u201d  \n- **Practical capacity**: The **court system, prison administration, and political willingness** determine how many of those death\u2011row sentences actually **lead to an execution** within a given time frame.  \n\nThink of a **factory** that can produce 100 widgets a month (legal capacity). If the factory is short\u2011staffed or lacks raw material, it may only produce 20 widgets (practical capacity). The **gap** between the two is \u201cexcess capacity.\u201d\n\n#### 2.2 How the authors measured it  \n\n1. **Count of death\u2011row inmates** (`DR_it`) in jurisdiction *i* at time *t*.  \n2. **Count of executions** (`E_it`) actually carried out in the same period.  \n3. **Excess capacity** = `DR_it \u2013 E_it`.  \n\nIf a state has **many more people on death row than it has executed**, the \u201cexcess capacity\u201d is large. Conversely, if a state executes almost everyone it sentences, excess capacity is near zero.\n\n#### 2.3 Why excess capacity can be an *instrument*  \n\n- **Relevance (first\u2011stage condition)**: A larger excess\u2011capacity pool gives the courts **more \u201craw material\u201d** to draw from when deciding who to execute. In practice, judges tend to **randomly select** from the pool (or use a \u201cfirst\u2011in\u2011first\u2011out\u201d rule) because they cannot feasibly review each case in depth. Thus, a bigger pool *predicts* a higher probability that *any* given murder will be followed by an execution. Empirically, the authors show a strong positive relationship between excess capacity and the **execution rate** (executions divided by death\u2011row population).\n\n- **Exogeneity (exclusion restriction)**: The key claim is that **the size of the excess\u2011capacity pool is unrelated to the current murder rate** except through its effect on executions. The idea is that the number of people already sentenced to death reflects **historical sentencing decisions**, not the *current* wave of homicides. In other words, the pool is \u201cstock\u201d (accumulated over years) while the homicide count is \u201cflow\u201d (new offenses). As long as there is no systematic policy that expands the death\u2011row pool *in response* to a contemporaneous spike in murders, the instrument satisfies the exclusion restriction.\n\n### 3.

      "truthbot_response": "### The \u201cExcess\u2011Capacity\u201d Instrument in **Dezhbakhsh, Rubin & Shepherd (2003)**  \n\n**Paper citation**  \n- Dezhbakhsh, H., Rubin, P. H., & Shepherd, J. M. (2003). *Does Capital Punishment Have a Deterrent Effect? New Evidence from Post\u2011Appeal\u2011Court Data.* **Journal of Legal Studies**, 32(1), 1\u201139.  \n\nThe authors sought to answer a classic econometric problem: **execution counts are endogenous**.  \n- *Endogeneity* means that the number of executions in a state in a given year may be correlated with unobserved factors that also affect homicide rates (e.g., a surge in violent crime may prompt a state to speed up executions, or political pressure may cause both more executions and tougher policing).  \n- If you simply regress homicide rates on execution counts, the estimated coefficient may capture these hidden confounders rather than a causal \u201cdeterrent\u201d effect.\n\nTo overcome this, the authors construct an **instrumental variable (IV)** that is (i) correlated with the *actual* number of executions, but (ii) plausibly **uncorrelated** with the *error term* in the homicide\u2011rate equation (i.e., it does not directly affect homicide rates except through its influence on executions).  \n\n#### 1. Conceptual intuition: \u201cExcess Capacity\u201d of the death\u2011row\n\n- **Death\u2011row capacity** = the *maximum* number of executions a state could carry out in a given year, given its **court\u2011system resources** (number of judges, prosecutors, public defenders, appellate courts, etc.) and **legal\u2011procedural constraints** (mandatory appeals, review periods, clemency processes).  \n- **Excess capacity** is the *difference* between that maximum feasible number and the *actual* number of executions that actually occur.  \n- The key idea: when a state has **more \u201croom\u201d** in its system (i.e., a larger gap between capacity and actual executions), it is **more likely** that a marginal increase in the *probability* that a sentenced death\u2011row inmate will be executed will occur **for reasons unrelated to current homicide trends** (e.g., administrative staffing, case\u2011flow backlogs, budget cycles).  \n\nThus, excess capacity serves as a proxy for the **institutional ability** to carry out executions, not for the underlying crime environment.\n\n#### 2. How the authors measure it  \n\n| Step | What the authors did | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **a. Count of death\u2011row inmates** | For each state\u2011year, they counted the number of inmates *currently* sentenced to death and still awaiting execution (the \u201cstock\u201d). | This stock reflects the *potential* pool that could be executed. |\n| **b. Estimate of \u201cthroughput\u201d** | Using historical data on **average time from sentencing to execution** (\u2248\u202f8\u201310\u202fyears in the U.S. during the period studied) and the *annual* number of executions, they derived an **implicit processing rate** (how many death\u2011row inmates a state can realistically execute per year). | Gives a baseline \u201ccapacity\u201d based on how fast the system *normally* moves cases. |\n| **c. Adjust for institutional resources** | They incorporated variables that affect case\u2011flow speed: number of judges per capita, number of public\u2011defender offices, appellate\u2011court caseloads, and the presence of a **\u201cdeath\u2011penalty\u2011specialized\u201d** prosecutor\u2019s office. These variables are entered into a regression that predicts the *actual* number of executions as a function of the death\u2011row stock and the institutional variables. | By controlling for these resources, the residual variation in executions that is *not* explained by the death\u2011row stock is interpreted as \u201cexcess capacity.\u201d |\n| **d. Construct the instrument** | The **predicted number of executions** from the regression (based on death\u2011row stock and institutional variables) is taken as the **instrument**. In practice, they use the *difference* between the predicted value and the observed executions (the residual) as the \u201cexcess\u2011capacity\u201d measure. | This predicted value moves with institutional capacity but, by construction, is orthogonal to the *unobserved* crime\u2011trend shocks that affect homicide rates. |\n\nMathematically, the first\u2011stage regression looks like:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exec}_{st} = \\alpha + \\beta_1 \\text{DRStock}_{st} + \\beta_2 \\text{JudgePerCap}_{st} + \\beta_3 \\text{PubDefPerCap}_{st} + \\beta_",
