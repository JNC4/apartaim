      "unknown_model_response": "### Post\u2011marketing (Phase\u202fIV) safety monitoring \u2013 how it works and why it matters  \n\nOnce a vaccine receives licensure and is added to the routine schedule, **continuous surveillance** begins.  The goal is to catch **very rare** or **delayed** adverse events that could not be seen in the tens of\u2011thousands of participants of the pre\u2011licensure trials.  The system is built on three complementary pillars:\n\n| **Pillar** | **How it works** | **What it catches** | **Key U.S. examples** (similar structures exist in Canada, the EU, Australia, etc.) |\n|------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Passive reporting** | \u2022 Health\u2011care providers, manufacturers, and the public can file a report after any health problem that follows vaccination.<br>\u2022 Reports are collected in a national database. | \u2022 Any event that a clinician or parent thinks might be linked to a vaccine, even if the link is uncertain.<br>\u2022 Signals that prompt deeper investigation. | **VAERS** \u2013 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (CDC\u202f+\u202fFDA).  Over 1\u202fmillion reports have been filed since 1990; the median time from vaccination to report is <\u202f2\u202fweeks. |\n| **Active (enhanced) surveillance** | \u2022 Pre\u2011defined cohorts are followed prospectively, with medical records reviewed automatically or by chart audit.<br>\u2022 Uses large electronic\u2011health\u2011record (EHR) networks, insurance claims, or dedicated sentinel sites. | \u2022 Rare events (1\u201110 per million doses) and events that occur **weeks\u2011to\u2011months** after vaccination.<br>\u2022 Provides a denominator (how many doses were given) so true rates can be calculated. | **VSD** \u2013 Vaccine Safety Datalink (CDC).  Over 24\u202fmillion members of integrated health systems are monitored; the system can detect a 2\u2011fold increase in an event with a baseline rate of 1 per 100,000 within weeks.<br>**PRISM** \u2013 Post\u2011licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (FDA). |\n| **Signal\u2011to\u2011action research** | \u2022 When a pattern emerges (e.g., a cluster of a specific diagnosis), epidemiologists launch **case\u2011control** or **self\u2011controlled risk interval** studies to test causality.<br>\u2022 Findings are reviewed by advisory committees (e.g., CDC\u2019s ACIP, FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee). | \u2022 Determines whether the association is real, its magnitude, and which sub\u2011populations (age, underlying condition) may be at higher risk. | Example: The 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine was linked in VAERS to a slight increase in **Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)**.  A VSD case\u2011control study quantified the risk at about **1\u20132 extra cases per million doses**, which was judged acceptable given the pandemic risk. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fWhat the data actually show about safety\n\n| **Vaccine (or group)** | **Common, mild reactions** (\u2265\u202f1\u202fin\u202f10) | **Rare, serious adverse events** (\u2248\u202f1\u202fin\u202f10\u2074\u201110\u2076) | **Evidence from post\u2011marketing surveillance** |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **DTaP, IPV, Hib, PCV13, Rotavirus, HepB, MMR, Varicella** | Pain/redness at injection site, low\u2011grade fever, irritability (usually resolve <\u202f48\u202fh) | **Febrile seizures** (\u2248\u202f1 per 3\u202f000\u20134\u202f000 DTaP doses) \u2013 most are brief and have no long\u2011term effect.<br>**Anaphylaxis** (\u2248\u202f1 per\u202f1\u202fmillion doses) \u2013 treatable with epinephrine; emergency departments are equipped. | VAERS and VSD have **not** identified any unexpected safety signals that outweigh the benefit.  The rate of febrile seizures after DTaP is **lower** than the rate after natural pertussis infection (\u2248\u202f1 per 70 infections). |\n| **Influenza (inactivated)** | Soreness, mild fever, muscle aches (1\u20112\u202fdays) | **Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome** (\u2248\u202f1\u20132 per million doses) \u2013 same background risk as in the general population;",
