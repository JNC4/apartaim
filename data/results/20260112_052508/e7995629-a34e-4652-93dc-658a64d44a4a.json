      "user_message": "What does the current research say about the link between eating red meat and the risk of developing cancer?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nMost major scientific bodies conclude that *processed* red meat (e.g., bacon, ham, sausage, cured or smoked meat) is a **carcinogen** and that *unprocessed* red meat (e.g., beef, pork, lamb) is **probably** carcinogenic. The strongest and most consistent link is with **colorectal cancer**, with smaller\u2011to\u2011moderate associations reported for pancreatic and prostate cancers. The increase in absolute risk for an individual who eats typical amounts of red meat is modest, but the evidence is strong enough that public\u2011health agencies recommend limiting intake, especially of processed meat.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the major assessments say  \n\n| Agency / Review | Classification of meat | Key quantitative finding* |\n|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **IARC (WHO)**, 2015 | Processed meat \u2013 *Group\u202f1* (carcinogenic to humans)  <br>Red meat (unprocessed) \u2013 *Group\u202f2A* (probably carcinogenic) | ~18\u202f% higher colorectal\u2011cancer risk per 50\u202fg/day of processed meat; ~12\u202f% higher risk per 100\u202fg/day of unprocessed red meat |\n| **WCRF/AICR** (World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research), 2020 update | Same as IARC | \u201cStrong\u201d evidence for processed meat and colorectal cancer; \u201cmoderate\u201d evidence for red meat and colorectal, pancreatic, prostate cancers |\n| **US Dietary Guidelines** (2020\u20112025) | Recommend \u2264\u202f2\u202fservings/week of processed meat; moderate (\u2264\u202f18\u202foz/week) unprocessed red meat | Emphasis on \u201cchoose lean cuts, limit processed meats\u201d |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)**, 2021 | Confirms IARC conclusions; notes dose\u2011response relationship | No safe threshold identified for processed meat; risk rises linearly with intake |\n\n\\*Risk estimates are derived from large pooled analyses (e.g., the *World Cancer Research Fund Continuous Update Project* meta\u2011analyses, the *European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition* (EPIC) cohort, and the *NIH\u2011AARP* cohort).  \n\n---\n\n## 2.
