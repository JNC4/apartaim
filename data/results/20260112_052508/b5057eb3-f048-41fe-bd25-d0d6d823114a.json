      "unknown_model_response": "## Short answer  \nIn most empirical studies, **rent control (RC) reduces the price that existing tenants pay in the short run, but it tends to **dampen the supply of rental housing and slow the growth of overall housing affordability over the long run**.  The magnitude of the effect varies a lot with the design of the policy (e.g., \u201chard\u201d vs. \u201csoft\u201d controls, vacancy\u2011decontrol, rent\u2011increase caps, exemptions for new construction) and with local market conditions (population growth, income trends, land\u2011use regulations).  \n\nBelow is a systematic walk\u2011through of what the research, policy\u2011maker experience, and theoretical models say, followed by the points of agreement, the main sources of disagreement, and a practical checklist for thinking about any specific rent\u2011control proposal.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical baseline  \n\n| Mechanism | How it works (in theory) | Expected long\u2011run outcome (all else equal) |\n|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** | Caps the rent that landlords can charge. | Reduces the incentive to supply new rental units or to maintain existing ones. |\n| **Supply\u2011side response** | Landlords may convert rentals to condos, switch to short\u2011term rentals, or withdraw from the market. | Net **rental housing stock shrinks** or grows more slowly. |\n| **Demand\u2011side response** | Lower legal rent makes apartments more attractive to renters, especially low\u2011income renters. | **Excess demand** \u2192 longer waiting lists, \u201cshadow rents\u201d (informal payments), and discrimination. |\n| **Quality adjustment** | With lower returns, landlords cut maintenance, upgrades, or invest less in new construction. | **Housing quality declines** (more disrepair, fewer amenities). |\n| **Dynamic effects** | Over time, the market re\u2011equilibrates: fewer units, higher \u201ceffective rent\u201d (including non\u2011price costs). | **Affordability gap widens** for new entrants, even if existing tenants stay cheaper. |\n\nThese mechanisms are the backbone of the \u201cstandard economic model\u201d of rent control.  The model predicts a **short\u2011run benefit for a subset of tenants** and a **long\u2011run cost for the broader housing market**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

I\u2019ll keep the discussion concrete (numbers, timelines, court cases) while also flagging the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Vacancy\u2011decontrol \u2013 the mechanic\n\n| Phase | What the landlord does | What the law requires | Typical timeline |\n|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| **A. Unit becomes vacant** | The tenant moves out (or the lease is otherwise terminated). | The landlord **must register the vacancy** with the municipal housing office (in Munich: \u201cMeldepflicht bei Wohnungswechsel\u201d). The registration triggers the \u201cde\u2011control\u201d clock. | Within **14\u202fdays** of the vacancy (most German states). |\n| **B. De\u2011control period starts** | The landlord can now **set a new \u201cinitial rent\u201d** for the next tenant. This rent is no longer bound by the 10\u202f%\u2011above\u2011median ceiling that applied to the previous contract. | The new rent must be **justified** by one of three \u201cbenchmark\u201d methods, e.g.: <br>1. **Mietspiegel** (local rent index) \u2013 the median for comparable apartments plus the 10\u202f% buffer.<br>2. **Comparable\u2011rent method** \u2013 citing at least three recent leases of similar size/condition in the same neighbourhood.<br>3. **Construction\u2011cost method** \u2013 if the landlord has performed a qualifying modernisation (see below). | The landlord has **up to 90\u202fdays** after the vacancy registration to post the new rent in the advertisement and to sign a lease. |\n| **C. Tenancy begins** | The new tenant signs a contract at the \u201cinitial rent.\u201d | The contract now **falls under the regular rent\u2011price brake** again: any future rent increases (e.g., annual CPI\u2011linked adjustments) cannot push the rent more than 10\u202f% above the *current* median. | From day\u202f1 of the new tenancy. |\n| **D. \u201cRe\u2011control\u201d after a set period** (optional, in some jurisdictions) | If the landlord **renovates** or **adds new rooms**, they may apply a **modernisation surcharge** (up to 8\u202f% of the renovation cost, spread over three years). | The surcharge is **added on top of the de\u2011controlled rent**; it does **not** reset the 10\u202f% cap. | Only after a qualifying modernisation (minimum \u20ac\u202f7\u202f500 per unit). |\n\n### Why the rule is meant to curb \u201cholding\u2011out\u201d\n\n1. **Economic signal:** If a landlord could keep a unit empty for years and still charge the old controlled rent when a tenant returns, the *opportunity cost* of vacancy would be zero. De\u2011control makes the *future* rent higher, so the landlord loses the price advantage of waiting.\n2. **Transparency:** The vacancy registration creates a public record. Municipal housing offices can track **average vacancy duration** and intervene if a pattern of \u201cstrategic vacancy\u201d emerges.\n3. **Legal deterrent:** In many German states, **unreasonable vacancy periods** (e.g., >\u202f6 months without a documented reason) can be challenged by tenant\u2011associations, leading to fines or forced re\u2011rental at a market\u2011reasonable price.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
