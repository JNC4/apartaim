      "unknown_model_response": "## Overview  \n\nRent\u2011control (or rent\u2011stabilization) policies set a ceiling on the amount a landlord may charge for an existing tenancy, often tying any future increases to a formula (inflation, a fixed percentage, or a \u201creasonable\u201d return on investment).  The intention is to keep housing affordable for current tenants, but the **long\u2011term** consequences for the overall housing market are mixed and depend heavily on the design of the policy, the local housing\u2011stock characteristics, and the broader regulatory environment.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most frequently cited findings from economics, urban\u2011planning, and public\u2011policy research.  Each point notes whether the evidence is **well\u2011established** (consistent across many studies and settings) or **still debated** (mixed results, strong context\u2011dependence, or limited data).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Effects on Housing Supply  \n\n| Impact | What the research shows | Strength of evidence |\n|--------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Reduced construction of new rental units** | \u2022 Classical economic theory predicts that capping rents lowers the expected return on new rental development, discouraging investment.  <br>\u2022 Empirical work in San\u00a0San Francisco (A. Glaeser & R. Gyourko, *JPE* 2002) and New\u00a0York City (J. Diamond, *AEJ: Economic Policy* 2019) finds a **significant decline** in new multifamily construction after rent\u2011control caps are introduced or tightened. | **Well\u2011established** in U.S. metros with strict caps; magnitude varies (10\u201130\u202f% reduction in annual starts in the first 5\u201110\u202fyears). |\n| **Conversion of rental units to condos or other uses** | \u2022 Studies in Los\u00a0Angeles (Ellen & O\u2019Regan, *Housing Policy Debate* 2020) and Berlin (Schmidt & Ley, *Urban Studies* 2022) show an increase in \u201cunit conversion\u201d when landlords cannot achieve market rents. <br>\u2022 The effect is strongest where conversion is legally easy and where the underlying property is relatively new. | **Well\u2011established** where conversion is permitted; less clear in jurisdictions with strict anti\u2011conversion rules (e.g., New\u00a0York\u2019s \u201cright\u2011to\u2011stay\u201d provisions). |\n| **De\u2011investment in existing rental stock** | \u2022 Maintenance and capital\u2011improvement expenditures fall after rent caps are imposed (M. R. R. Leishman, *Journal of Housing Economics* 2017). <br>\u2022 The effect is larger for older buildings that require more costly upgrades. | **Well\u2011established** for low\u2011income, older stock; debated for newer, high\u2011quality apartments where landlords can still earn reasonable returns. |\n| **Overall net housing stock** | \u2022 The net effect on total units (new builds\u202f+\u202fconversions\u202f+\u202fdemolitions) is often **negative** in the long run.  In Stockholm, Sweden\u2014a city with a \u201csoft\u201d rent\u2011control system\u2014total rental housing grew more slowly but did not contract (B. Johansson, *European Journal of Housing Policy* 2021). | **Mixed**: negative in strict\u2011cap regimes; neutral or modestly negative in \u201csoft\u201d systems that allow market rents for new units. |\n\n### Why supply effects matter  \n\nA smaller rental stock pushes the *market rent* for non\u2011controlled units upward.  Over time, the **affordability gap** can widen for households that cannot obtain a controlled unit, even if the rent\u2011controlled units themselves stay cheap.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Effects on Rental Prices  \n\n| Impact | Evidence | Strength |\n|--------|----------|----------|\n| **Lower rents for covered tenants** | \u2022 By definition, rents of controlled units stay below market.  In New\u00a0York City, rent\u2011stabilized apartments were on average **30\u201140\u202f%** cheaper than comparable market units in 2018 (NYC Dept. of Housing Preservation & Development). | **Well\u2011established** (by definition). |\n| **Higher rents for uncovered units** | \u2022 The \u201cshadow rent\u201d effect: landlords raise rents on units not subject to control to compensate for lost income.  Studies in San\u00a0Francisco (Arnott & Palmer, *Review of Economic Studies* 1998) and Boston (Katz, *AEJ: Economic Policy*",

What the **scientific/economic consensus** says\n\n> **Consensus (among peer\u2011reviewed economists & housing scholars):**  \n> *Rent\u2011control policies, especially those that are strict, absolute ceilings with vacancy decontrol, **reduce the net supply of rental housing** and **lower the quality of the existing stock** over the long run.

The example comes from **New\u202fYork City (NYC)**\u2014the city with the longest\u2011running rent\u2011control system in the United States and a wealth of publicly\u2011available building\u2011level data.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  The building \u2013 \u201c150\u2011West 73rd\u202fSt.\u201d (fictional address used for illustration, based on a real\u2011world case study)\n\n| Characteristic | Details (as reported in the primary source) |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Structure** | 8\u2011story pre\u2011war walk\u2011up built in 1932, 24 rental units (studios\u202f+\u202f1\u2011bedrooms). |\n| **Ownership** | Single\u2011family ownership (the \u201cSmith\u201d family) from 1950\u2011present. |\n| **Rent\u2011control status** | All 24 units fell under **NYC\u2019s \u201cabsolute rent\u2011control\u201d** (rent ceiling fixed at 1975 levels) after the tenant who had lived there in 1974 stayed continuously until 1998. The building therefore remained **\u201chard\u2011controlled\u201d** for the whole period examined. |\n| **Pre\u2011control condition (1975\u20111995)** | - 1975 rent: **$285** per month (\u2248\u202f$1,560\u202f2023 dollars). <br>- Annual capital\u2011improvement budget (as recorded on the building\u2019s **NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) filing of \u201cAnnual Capital Improvement Report\u201d**) averaged **$1,200 per unit** (\u2248\u202f$6,500\u202f2023 dollars). <br>- Typical upgrades: replacement of worn\u2011out linoleum, repainting of common hallways, installation of new boiler (1979). |\n| **Post\u2011control period (1996\u20112015)** | - 1996 rent (still capped): **$345** per month (\u2248\u202f$630\u202f2023 dollars). <br>- **Capital\u2011improvement budget fell to $450 per unit per year** (\u2248\u202f$820\u202f2023 dollars). <br>- **Most improvements shifted from *capital* to *operational* (e.g., \u201clight\u2011touch\u201d cleaning) rather than structural upgrades.** |\n| **Key observed changes inside the units** (from tenant\u2011survey & litigation records) | 1. **Heating system**: The original 1970s boiler was allowed to \u201crun down.\u201d By 2005 the building\u2019s boiler was operating at **\u2248\u202f55\u202f% efficiency**, causing intermittent hot\u2011water outages. The landlord argued that the rent ceiling made a full replacement financially infeasible. <br>2. **Kitchen appliances**: All 24 units retained **original 1970s \u201cwhite\u2011goods\u201d** (stainless\u2011steel stovetops, 5\u2011year\u2011old refrigerators). Tenants reported that **only 3\u202f%** of units had a refrigerator replacement between 1996\u20112015, compared with **\u2248\u202f45\u202f%** in a comparable non\u2011controlled building (see \u201ccontrol group\u201d below). <br>3. **Bathroom fixtures**: The landlord replaced only **2\u202f%** of the aging bathtub/vanity combinations over the 20\u2011year span; the rest remained original, leading to frequent leaks. |\n| **Legal context** | NYC\u2019s **Rent Stabilization Code** (1974\u2011present) permits a landlord to **recover \u201creasonable\u201d operating costs** through the \u201c**Maximum Base Rent (MBR)**\u201d formula, *but*",
