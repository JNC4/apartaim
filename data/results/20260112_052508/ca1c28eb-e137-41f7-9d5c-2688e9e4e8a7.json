Molecular & genetic characterisation** | Identify what DNA has been inserted, where it landed in the plant genome, and whether any unintended changes occurred. | Guarantees that the only new trait is the one intended (e.g., insect\u2011toxic Bt protein) and that no harmful genes (e.g., antibiotic\u2011resistance markers) are present. | \u2022 DNA sequencing of the transgene cassette and flanking regions  <br>\u2022 Bio\u2011informatic comparison of the new protein\u2019s amino\u2011acid sequence to known toxins or allergens. |\n| **2. Compositional analysis** | Compare the GM food\u2019s nutrients, antinutrients, vitamins, minerals, and natural toxins to those of a conventional counterpart and to a range of non\u2011GM varieties. | Detects any unintended changes in the plant\u2019s chemistry that could affect health (e.g., higher levels of a naturally occurring anti\u2011nutrient). | \u2022 Mass\u2011spectrometry and chromatography for metabolites  <br>\u2022 Nutrient panels (protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, vitamins). |\n| **3. Allergenicity assessment** | Test whether the new protein could trigger allergic reactions. | Allergic reactions are a leading safety concern for any novel food protein. | \u2022 **In\u2011silico**: Compare protein sequence to known allergens (FAO/WHO 2001 guidelines). <br>\u2022 **In\u2011vitro**: Serum IgE binding assays using blood from allergic individuals. <br>\u2022 **Digestibility**: Simulated gastric/intestinal digestion to see if the protein is rapidly broken down (stable proteins are more likely to be allergenic). |\n| **4. Toxicology testing** | Determine if the new protein or the whole GM food can cause acute or chronic toxicity. | Provides the core evidence that the food will not harm consumers over a lifetime. | \u2022 **Acute oral toxicity** in rodents (single\u2011dose LD\u2085\u2080 tests). <br>\u2022 **Sub\u2011chronic (90\u2011day) feeding studies** in rodents, measuring growth, organ weights, blood chemistry, histopathology. <br>\u2022 **Chronic / carcinogenicity studies** (rarely required for single\u2011protein events because the protein is already known to be safe). |\n| **5. Nutritional assessment** | Evaluate whether the GM food is nutritionally equivalent or, in some cases, nutritionally superior. | Confirms that the food can safely replace its conventional counterpart in the diet. | \u2022 Feeding trials in animals (and occasionally in humans) to compare growth, feed conversion, and nutrient status. |\n| **6. Environmental risk assessment (pre\u2011market)** | Examine the likelihood that the GM plant could affect ecosystems (e.g., gene flow, non\u2011target organisms). | While not a direct human\u2011health test, environmental impacts can indirectly affect food safety (e.g., creation of new weeds). | \u2022 Conducted by regulatory agencies (USDA, EFSA, etc.) using field trials, modelling of pollen dispersal, and studies on non\u2011target insects. |\n| **7. Post\u2011market monitoring** | Ongoing surveillance after the product is on the market. | Detects rare or long\u2011term effects that may not appear in pre\u2011market studies. | \u2022 Voluntary reporting systems, national food\u2011safety inspections, and sometimes targeted epidemiological studies. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Bioinformatic screening** | \u2022 Compare the new protein(s) to known toxins and allergens using databases (e.g., AllergenOnline, TOXBASE). | Early flag for potential allergenicity or toxicity before any animal work. | Same as above; independent academic groups often repeat the analysis. |\n| **c. Protein expression & compositional analysis** | \u2022 Measure levels of the new protein(s) in the edible tissue. <br>\u2022 Compare macro\u2011 and micronutrient composition (protein, fat, carbs, vitamins, anti\u2011nutrients) with a conventional (non\u2011GM) counterpart. | Demonstrates that the GM food is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d in nutrition and that the novel protein is not present at unexpectedly high levels. | Laboratory assays (ELISA, mass spec) \u2192 regulatory review. |\n| **d. Allergenicity testing** | \u2022 In\u2011silico sequence similarity (\u226535% identity over 80 aa). <br>\u2022 Digestibility in simulated gastric/intestinal fluids. <br>\u2022 Serum IgE binding from panels of allergic individuals (rarely required now). | Allergens are often resistant to digestion and share sequence motifs; these tests catch many known allergenic features. | Academic labs, contract research organizations; regulators evaluate the data. |\n| **e. Acute and sub\u2011chronic toxicology** | \u2022 90\u2011day (or 28\u2011day) rodent feeding studies with the GM food at 10\u2013100\u00d7 the expected human intake. <br>\u2022 Endpoints: body weight, organ weight, clinical chemistry, histopathology. | Detects any overt toxicity that would not be predicted from the protein\u2019s known function. | GLP\u2011compliant contract labs; data submitted to FDA/EFSA etc. |\n| **f. Chronic/carcinogenicity & reproductive studies** (when warranted) | \u2022 2\u2011year rodent bioassays, multigeneration studies, or specific developmental toxicity tests. | Required only if the protein has a plausible link to cancer/reproduction or if earlier studies raise concerns. | Same as e., but far fewer GM crops undergo these because the prior data are usually reassuring. |\n| **g. Nutritional impact & intended benefit** | \u2022 Evaluate whether the GM trait changes nutrient levels (e.g., Golden Rice\u2019s \u03b2\u2011carotene). <br>\u2022 Model expected dietary contribution. | Confirms that the intended nutritional improvement is achieved without creating deficits. | Developers + independent nutritionists. |\n| **h. Post\u2011market monitoring (optional but increasingly common)** | \u2022 Surveillance for adverse events (e.g., food\u2011borne illness reports). <br>\u2022 Environmental monitoring of gene flow, resistance\u2011gene spread. | Provides real\u2011world safety data and detects rare/unanticipated effects. | Government agencies, academic consortia, sometimes industry\u2011run \u201cindependent\u201d monitoring. |\n\n> **Key point:** The assessment is *cumulative*: no single test decides safety.
