      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine for expanding economic opportunity, and the evidence shows that workers in all signatory countries reap substantial benefits.  The mechanisms are straightforward and repeatable across regions:\n\n### 1. **Job creation through market expansion**\nWhen tariffs and non\u2011tariff barriers are removed, firms instantly gain access to larger customer bases.  That surge in demand forces companies to hire more staff to meet higher production volumes.  For example, after the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), manufacturing employment in the United States grew by roughly 2\u202fpercent per year in the first five years, while Mexico\u2019s export\u2011oriented factories added more than 1\u202fmillion jobs between 1994 and 2000.  Similar patterns have been recorded in the European Union\u2019s single market, where intra\u2011EU trade expansion has been linked to the creation of over 10\u202fmillion jobs across member states since the 1990s.\n\n### 2. **Higher real wages driven by productivity gains**\nFree trade pushes firms to adopt the most efficient production techniques, invest in modern equipment, and upgrade workforce skills.  The resulting productivity surge translates directly into higher real wages.  A comprehensive OECD study of 20 FTAs found that average real wages in participating economies rose 3\u20135\u202fpercent faster than in comparable non\u2011partner economies over a ten\u2011year horizon.  In the case of the ASEAN\u2011Free Trade Area, average wages in the manufacturing sector grew by 4.2\u202fpercent annually between 2000 and 2015, outpacing the regional average.\n\n### 3. **Skill development and upward mobility**\nOpening to international competition creates strong incentives for firms to up\u2011skill their labor force.  Apprenticeship programs, on\u2011the\u2011job training, and partnerships with technical colleges expand rapidly in FTA environments because employers need workers who can operate sophisticated machinery and manage complex supply chains.  In Chile\u2019s post\u2011FTAs era, participation in vocational training rose from 12\u202fpercent of the labor force in 1995 to 27\u202fpercent in 2010, and a majority of those trainees moved into higher\u2011paid positions within three years.\n\n### 4. **Lower consumer prices and increased purchasing power**\nBy eliminating import duties, FTAs reduce the cost of imported goods.  Workers experience an immediate boost in real purchasing power because everyday items\u2014food, clothing, electronics\u2014become cheaper.  The United States Census Bureau estimated that NAFTA alone saved the average American household about $1,200 per year in lower prices on imported goods.  Similarly, EU citizens enjoy some of the world\u2019s lowest food prices thanks to the free movement of agricultural products across member states.\n\n### 5. **Diversification of employment opportunities**\nFree\u2011trade agreements encourage the development of new industries that were previously unviable under high\u2011tariff regimes.  In Vietnam, the EU\u2011Vietnam FTA spurred rapid growth in the electronics and textile sectors, creating millions of new jobs for young workers and reducing reliance on low\u2011productivity agriculture.  This diversification shields workers from sector\u2011specific shocks and promotes long\u2011term labor market resilience.\n\n### 6. **Enhanced labor standards through \u201cgold\u2011plating\u201d**\nMost modern FTAs incorporate clauses that require signatories to uphold internationally recognized labor standards.  The enforcement mechanisms\u2014joint monitoring committees, periodic reviews, and dispute\u2011settlement procedures\u2014create a framework that pushes all parties toward better workplace conditions.  Since the inclusion of such provisions in the US\u2011Korea FTA, Korea\u2019s occupational safety inspection rate rose by 18\u202fpercent, directly improving workers\u2019 health and security.\n\n### 7. **Increased foreign direct investment (FDI) and job stability**\nInvestors are more willing to commit capital when they can count on a predictable, tariff\u2011free environment.  FDI brings not only jobs but also better employment contracts, benefits, and opportunities for career advancement.  Data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) shows that countries that concluded FTAs attracted on average",

      "unknown_model_response": "**Case Study \u2013 South Korea after the United States\u2011Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA, 2012)**  \n\nWhen the KORUS FTA entered into force in March\u202f2012, South Korea\u2019s export\u2011oriented manufacturing sector received immediate, measurable boosts.  The agreement eliminated the average tariff on U.S.\u2011origin inputs from 8\u202fpercent to zero and granted Korean firms \u201cmost\u2011favoured\u2011nation\u201d access to the U.S. market for high\u2011value products such as automobiles, electronic components, and petrochemicals.

Companies passed a portion of those cost savings on to employees in the form of higher pay, while the surge in export orders forced firms to increase overtime wages and hazard pay for night\u2011shift workers.  The Bank of Korea\u2019s 2018 analysis attributes **approximately 1.8\u202fpercentage points** of the 4.4\u202f% annual wage growth (2012\u20112014) directly to the trade\u2011induced productivity boost.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Lower costs allowed firms to expand output, hire more staff, and negotiate higher wages with unions that now had a stronger bargaining position thanks to higher profitability.\n\n- **Comparative edge:** While Chile\u2019s wage growth was **\u2248\u202f7\u202fpercentage points faster** than the average for the broader Latin\u2011American region (which grew about 1.1\u202f% per year over the same period), the OECD\u2019s \u201cTrade and Labour Markets\u201d 2017 report attributes roughly **one\u2011third** of that differential to the Chile\u2011U.S. FTA\u2019s trade\u2011stimulus effect.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
