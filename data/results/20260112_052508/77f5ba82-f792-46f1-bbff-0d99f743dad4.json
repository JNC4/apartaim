      "unknown_model_response": "Current scientific research does **not** support the claim that 5G cell towers cause significant health problems. Major health organizations\u2014including the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and national health agencies in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere\u2014have reviewed the available data on radio\u2011frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (the type of radiation used by 5G) and concluded the following:\n\n1. **Exposure Levels** \u2013 The RF energy emitted by 5G base stations is far below the limits set by international safety guidelines. These limits are based on extensive studies of thermal (heating) effects, which are the only proven mechanism by which RF can cause tissue damage at the intensities used for communications.\n\n2. **Epidemiological Studies** \u2013 Large\u2011scale population studies looking at long\u2011term exposure to RF fields (including those from earlier generations of mobile technology) have not found a consistent link to cancer, neurological disorders, reproductive effects, or other chronic illnesses.\n\n3. **Laboratory Research** \u2013 In vitro (cell\u2011culture) and animal studies that have examined non\u2011thermal effects of RF exposure at levels comparable to or higher than those from 5G have produced mixed, often non\u2011reproducible results. Meta\u2011analyses of these studies typically conclude that the evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship.\n\n4. **WHO Position** \u2013 The WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies RF fields as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic\u201d (Group\u202f2B), a category that also includes substances like coffee and pickled vegetables. This classification reflects a very limited evidence base and does **not** indicate that 5G is a proven health hazard.\n\n5. **Ongoing Monitoring** \u2013 Because 5G introduces higher frequencies (including millimeter\u2011wave bands) and denser antenna deployments, researchers continue to monitor health outcomes. To date, peer\u2011reviewed studies released since the rollout of 5G have not demonstrated new adverse effects beyond what is already known for existing RF exposure.\n\nIn summary, the preponderance of peer\u2011reviewed scientific evidence and the conclusions of authoritative health bodies indicate that 5G cell towers, when operating within established safety standards, do **not** pose a significant health risk. Ongoing research and surveillance are prudent, but current data do not support claims of harmful health effects from 5G infrastructure.",
