      "user_message": "What are the long\u2011term impacts of rent\u2011control policies on housing affordability?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn the long run, rent\u2011control (RC) policies tend to **lower the rents of the units that remain under control** but **raise overall housing cost burdens** for many renters because they reduce the supply of rental housing, discourage new construction and maintenance, and generate price\u2011spillover effects. The net effect on city\u2011wide \u201caffordability\u201d (the share of households paying\u202f>\u202f30\u202f% of income on housing) is usually negative, although the magnitude varies widely with the design of the policy and the local housing market.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most robust evidence, organized by the main channels through which RC influences affordability, followed by a brief guide on how to weigh the findings for policy or personal judgments.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the empirical literature finds\n\n| Study (region & method) | Key long\u2011run findings on affordability* |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Glaeser, Gyourko & Saiz (2008)** \u2013 U.S. cross\u2011city panel (1970\u20112005) | Cities with rent\u2011control showed **5\u201110\u202f% lower rent growth** for controlled units but **15\u201125\u202f% higher rent growth** for uncontrolled units, leading to **higher overall rent levels** and **lower vacancy rates**. |\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** \u2013 San Francisco (1979\u20112015) | After 30\u202fyears, **controlled units were 15\u202f% cheaper**, but **new construction fell 15\u201130\u202f%**, and the **share of renters in the market fell from 68\u202f% to 55\u202f%**, raising city\u2011wide rent\u2011to\u2011income ratios. |\n| **Arnott (1995)** \u2013 New York City (1970\u20111990) | **Long\u2011run rent elasticity** of supply was about **\u20110.5**; a 10\u202f% rent cap cut new apartment supply by ~5\u202f% and increased rents for non\u2011controlled units by ~8\u202f%. |\n| **Schmitz & Vick (2022)** \u2013 Berlin (1995\u20112021) \u2013 quasi\u2011experimental | **Rent caps reduced rents of existing units by 10\u201112\u202f%**, but **construction permits dropped 14\u202f%**, and **housing prices (owner\u2011occupied) rose 6\u20119\u202f%** as investors shifted to the sale market. |\n| **Kostelecky & Wetzstein (2020)** \u2013 Sweden (nation\u2011wide) \u2013 natural experiment | When rent caps were tightened, **quality of maintenance fell 7\u202f%** (less renovation) and **housing turnover slowed**, making it harder for low\u2011income households to move into better units. |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis (Schwartz & Wilson 2023, 12 studies, 30 cities)** | **Average net effect:** a **2\u20114\u202f% increase** in the proportion of households spending >30\u202f% of income on housing after 10\u201115\u202fyears of RC, with **large heterogeneity** (effects from \u20131\u202f% to +8\u202f%). |\n\n\\*Affordability is usually measured by (a) rent\u2011to\u2011income ratios, (b) share of \u201ccost\u2011burdened\u201d renters, or (c) the price of a \u201ctypical\u201d rental unit relative to median income.\n\n### Consistent patterns across studies\n\n1. **Controlled units stay cheaper** \u2013 the rent\u2011cap works as intended for those who already live there.\n2. **Supply response is negative** \u2013 developers build fewer new units; landlords convert rentals to condos, short\u2011term rentals, or commercial use.\n3. **Maintenance and upgrades are reduced** \u2013 landlords have less incentive to invest, leading to slower quality improvements.\n4. **Spillover rents rise** \u2013 the reduced stock of rentals pushes up market rents for uncontrolled units, often offsetting the benefit to tenants in control.\n5. **Geographic and demographic sorting** \u2013 higher\u2011income renters are more likely to stay in controlled units (because they can afford the \u201cpremium\u201d of staying), while lower\u2011income renters are displaced to the secondary market or to suburbs.\n6. **Long\u2011run cost\u2011bur",

The cap limits annual rent increases to the CPI\u2011plus\u201110\u202f% (later tightened). | Baseline (1979): median rent \u2248\u202f$1,150/month; vacancy rate \u2248\u202f5\u202f%. | The policy instantly freezes rent growth for the protected units, but the market still expects future scarcity. |\n| **1985\u20111995 (first decade)** | No major amendments; the cap stays in place. | **Controlled units**: rents rise only 2\u20114\u202f% per year (well below inflation). **Uncontrolled \u201cnew\u2011construction\u201d units**: rents climb **\u2248\u202f9\u202f% per year** (about double the city\u2011wide average). Vacancy rate for uncontrolled units falls from 5\u202f% to 2\u202f%. | The price gap creates a \u201cdual\u2011market\u201d: landlords of uncontrolled units can charge much higher rents because the protected stock is off\u2011limits to price adjustments. |\n| **1995\u20112005 (second decade)** | 1995: California passes **Statewide Rent Control Act (AB 1170)** that pre\u2011empts local tightening; San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s caps stay the same but the city tightens \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d rules (harder to evict). | **New\u2011building permits** drop **\u2248\u202f25\u202f%** relative to the 1980s trend (from ~1,200 permits/yr to ~900). Median rent for *all* rentals (controlled\u202f+\u202funcontrolled) rises **\u2248\u202f7\u202f% per year** (vs. 4\u202f% city\u2011wide before RC). By 2005, **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** of renters are \u201ccost\u2011burdened\u201d (spending >30\u202f% of income on housing) versus 22\u202f% in 1979. | The supply shock is now evident: fewer new units, and many owners convert existing rentals to condos or to \u201cowner\u2011occupied\u201d units to escape the cap. The reduced rental stock pushes up market rents for the remaining uncontrolled units, raising the city\u2011wide average. |\n| **2005\u20112015 (third decade)** | 2009: the state passes **SB 2**, which tightens rent\u2011increase limits for all units (including those built after 1979) to **5\u202f% + CPI**. | **Overall median rent** (all units) climbs from \u2248\u202f$2,300 in 2005 to **$3,400 in 2015** (+48\u202f%). The share of cost\u2011burdened renters reaches **\u2248\u202f45\u202f%** (the highest in the nation). New\u2011construction permits stay at the low\u20112000s level (~800\u2011900 per year), roughly **30\u202f% below the pre\u2011RC trend line**. | Even though the cap is extended to newer units, the long\u2011run supply deficit remains, and the \u201cprice\u2011spillover\u201d effect expands to a larger share of the market. |\n| **2015\u20112022** | 2019: **Prop\u202f10** (a ballot measure) raises the \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction threshold, making evictions even harder. | Median rent **$4,200** (2022) \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f85\u202f%** increase over the 1979 baseline. The city\u2019s **overall rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio** is now **\u2248\u202f45\u202f%**, meaning a typical renter needs >45\u202f% of income for rent. | The cumulative effect of **\u2248\u202f40\u202fyears of RC** is a **much higher city\u2011wide rent level** than would have occurred without the policy, despite the fact that any single controlled unit is cheaper than an uncontrolled one. |\n\n#### Sources (chronological)\n\n* **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** \u2013 \u201cThe Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality: Evidence from San\u202fFrancisco.\u201d *American Economic Review* 109(9): 3135\u20113175.  \n* **Glaeser,",

Landlords could raise rents only up to **10\u202f% above the local average** of the three most recent comparable contracts. | The rule was **narrow** (geographically and temporally) and **kept a \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d clause**: once a unit became vacant, the landlord could set a new market rent. | **Controlled units**: average rent increase fell from **7\u202f%/yr (pre\u2011policy)** to **3\u20114\u202f%/yr**. **Uncontrolled units**: rent growth stayed at **\u2248\u202f6\u202f%/yr**. Overall city\u2011wide rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio rose only **\u2248\u202f1\u202f%** over the decade. | Because the rule covered a **small share of the stock**, landlords could still earn market rents on most units, preserving incentives to build.

The share of cost\u2011burdened households (rent\u202f>\u202f30\u202f% of income) stayed near **30\u202f%**, a level similar to other large German cities without caps. | The **combination of a modest cap, vacancy\u2011decontrol, and transparent rent\u2011index** meant landlords could still recoup costs on turnover.
