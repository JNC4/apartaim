Fluoride ions become incorporated into the enamel of developing teeth and also act on the oral biofilm to reduce acid production by bacteria.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How Fluoride Works \u2013 The Biological Mechanism\n\n| Process | What happens | Evidence |\n|---------|--------------|----------|\n| **Topical (direct contact with teeth)** | Fluoride promotes formation of fluorapatite, a mineral more resistant to acid dissolution than hydroxyapatite. It also inhibits bacterial enzymes (enolase) that produce acid. | In\u2011vitro studies, animal models, and human clinical trials (see \u201cbenefit\u201d section). |\n| **Systemic (ingested during tooth development)** | Fluoride circulating in blood is deposited in the forming enamel of permanent teeth, making them less prone to decay later. | Historical data from areas with naturally high fluoride (e.g., \u201cfluorosis belt\u201d in the U.S.) show lower caries rates. |\n| **Potential toxic actions at high dose** | Fluoride can interfere with enzyme activity, mitochondrial function, and calcium metabolism when present in concentrations far above the recommended range. | Observed in animal studies at doses >10\u202fmg/kg/day; human data limited to much higher exposures (e.g., industrial accidents). |\n\nThe **dose\u2011response curve** is steep: the **beneficial window** (\u22480.5\u20131.0\u202fmg/L in drinking water) is far below the **threshold for systemic toxicity** (\u22485\u202fmg/L for most adults, per WHO).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Scientific Consensus on \u201cSafe\u201d / \u201cOptimal\u201d Levels  \n\n| Organization | Recommended Fluoride Level (mg/L) | Basis of Recommendation |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | \u22641.5 (optimal 0.5\u20131.0) | Balances caries reduction with low risk of dental fluorosis. |\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)** | 0.7 (range 0.6\u20130.8) | Adjusted in 2015 to reflect lower average caries risk and to reduce fluorosis. |\n| **American Dental Association (ADA)** | 0.7 (same as CDC) | \u201cCommunity Water Fluoridation\u201d policy statement. |\n| **European Commission (Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks, SCHEER)** | 0.5\u20131.0 (some countries use 1.5) | Emphasizes monitoring for fluorosis. |\n| **National Academies of Sciences (U.S.)** | 0.7 (same as CDC) | 2020 report reaffirmed safety at this level. |\n\n**Key point:** Across major health bodies, the **consensus** is that **0.7\u202fmg/L** (or a range of **0.5\u20131.0\u202fmg/L**) provides a **net public\u2011health benefit** with **no credible evidence of systemic adverse effects**",

How Fluoride Works (the biological mechanism)\n\n| Process | What the science says | Key references |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Enamel remineralisation** | Fluoride ions replace hydroxide in hydroxy\u2011apatite crystals to form fluorapatite, which is less soluble in acid. This makes tooth enamel more resistant to the de\u2011mineralising effect of bacterial acids. | Fejerskov & Kidd, *Dental Caries* (2015); Ten Cate & Duijsters, *J Dent Res* 2007 |\n| **Inhibition of bacterial metabolism** | At low concentrations (\u22480.1\u20130.5\u202fppm) fluoride interferes with the activity of enolase, an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway of *Streptococcus mutans* and other cariogenic bacteria, reducing acid production. | Lussi et al., *Caries Res* 2004 |\n| **Topical vs. systemic effect** | The majority of the caries\u2011preventive benefit comes from **topical exposure** of teeth to fluoride in saliva and plaque, not from the fluoride that is incorporated into the developing tooth during tooth formation. | CDC \u201cFluoridation\u201d fact sheet (2022) |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Recommended / \u201cOptimal\u201d Fluoride Levels\n\n| Jurisdiction | Typical target concentration | Rationale |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------|\n| **United States (EPA, CDC)** | 0.7\u202fmg/L (\u22480.7\u202fppm) (since 2015) | Chosen as a single level that balances caries reduction with low risk of dental fluorosis, accounting for other fluoride sources (toothpaste, foods). | CDC, \u201cCommunity Water Fluoridation\u201d 2022 |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | 0.5\u20131.0\u202fmg/L | Similar reasoning; WHO notes the level should be set based on local climate, water consumption, and existing fluoride exposure. | WHO \u201cGuidelines for Drinking\u2011water Quality\u201d 4th ed. 2022 |\n| **European Union** | No EU\u2011wide mandatory level; many countries set 0.6\u20130.8\u202f",

How Much Fluoride Leads to Fluorosis?  (Dose\u2011Response Evidence)\n\n| Fluoride source | Typical intake that has been linked to **visible** (Dean\u202f\u2265\u202f1) fluorosis in epidemiologic studies |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Water at 0.7\u202fmg/L** (average 2\u202fL/day) | **\u2248\u202f1.4\u202fmg F\u207b per day**.  In population studies, **\u2248\u202f5\u201310\u202f%** of children who consume this amount *plus* fluoride from other sources (toothpaste, tea, processed foods) develop very mild (Dean\u202f0.5\u20131) fluorosis. |\n| **Water at 1.0\u202fmg/L** (average 2\u202fL/day) | **\u2248\u202f2\u202fmg F\u207b/day**.  The prevalence of Dean\u202f\u2265\u202f1 rises to **\u2248\u202f15\u202f%**, still mostly very mild. |\n| **Water \u2265\u202f2\u202fmg/L** (rare in the U.S.; common in some endemic\u2011fluoride regions) | **\u2265\u202f4\u202fmg F\u207b",
