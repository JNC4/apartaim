      "unknown_model_response": "**Why doctors (and public\u2011health agencies) recommend vaccinating children**\n\n| Reason | What it means in practice | Key evidence |\n|--------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| **1. Prevent serious disease** | Vaccines stop children from getting infections that can cause hospitalization, permanent disability, or death (e.g., measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, Hib meningitis, rotavirus). | \u2022\u202fThe WHO estimates that routine childhood immunisation prevents **2\u20133\u202fmillion deaths each year** worldwide.<br>\u2022\u202fIn the United States, the 2019\u20112020\u202fCDC \u201cVaccine\u2011Preventable Diseases\u201d report shows >\u202f99\u202f% declines in incidence for most of the diseases covered by the routine schedule compared with the pre\u2011vaccine era. |\n| **2. Protect the community (herd immunity)** | When enough people are immune, the pathogen cannot spread easily, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (infants too young for certain shots, people with severe immune deficiencies, or those who have a contraindication). | \u2022\u202fMeasles requires ~\u202f95\u202f% coverage to maintain herd immunity; when coverage drops below that, outbreaks recur (e.g., the 2019\u202fU.S. measles resurgence,\u202f>\u202f1,200 cases).<br>\u2022\u202fMathematical models (e.g., Anderson & May, *Science* 1991) show that herd immunity reduces the basic reproduction number (R\u2080) below 1, extinguishing transmission. |\n| **3. Reduce health\u2011care costs and societal disruption** | Fewer sick days for children and parents, fewer emergency\u2011room visits, less need for expensive treatments, and fewer school closures. | \u2022\u202fA 2020\u202fCDC cost\u2011effectiveness analysis estimated that the routine U.S. childhood immunisation schedule saves **\u2248\u202f$13\u202fbillion annually** in direct medical costs and **\u2248\u202f$30\u202fbillion** in societal costs. |\n| **4. Preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics** | Some bacterial infections (e.g., Hib, pneumococcal disease) are prevented by vaccines, lowering the number of infections that would otherwise require antibiotics and thereby helping combat antimicrobial resistance. | \u2022\u202fThe 2021\u202fWHO \u201cAntimicrobial Resistance\u201d report cites the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as a key tool in reducing antibiotic\u2011prescribed pneumonia episodes. |\n| **5. Provide a predictable, scheduled health\u2011care interaction** | The routine immunisation schedule gives families regular check\u2011ups, during which growth, nutrition, and developmental milestones are monitored. | \u2022\u202fStudies (e.g., Omer et\u202fal., *Pediatrics* 2019) show higher rates of well\u2011child visits among children on schedule, which improves overall preventive care. |\n\n---\n\n### How safe are childhood vaccines?\n\n| Aspect | What the data show | Typical side\u2011effects | Very rare serious events |\n|--------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Rigorous pre\u2011licensure testing** | Each vaccine undergoes **Phase\u202fI\u2011III clinical trials** with thousands of participants, including infants, to assess safety and efficacy. The U.S. FDA, EMA, WHO\u2019s Pre\u2011Qualification Programme, and other regulators review the data before approval. | \u2022\u202fPain, redness, or swelling at the injection site (most common).<br>\u2022\u202fLow\u2011grade fever, irritability, or mild rash (usually within 1\u20132\u202fdays). | \u2022\u202fAnaphylaxis: ~\u202f1\u202fcase per\u202f1\u20112\u202fmillion doses (recognised and treatable with epinephrine).<br>\u2022\u202fFebrile seizures after some combination vaccines (e.g., DTaP\u2011IPV\u2011Hib\u2011Polio): about 1\u20114\u202fcases per\u202f10\u202f000 doses, but these seizures are generally brief and do not cause long\u2011term harm.<br>\u2022\u202fMyocarditis/pericarditis after mRNA COVID\u201119 vaccines in adolescents: ~\u202f10\u201115\u202fcases per\u202fmillion second doses, with most recovering fully. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure surveillance** | \u2022\u202fVAERS (U.S.) \u2013 a national early\u2011warning system that collects any reported event after vaccination.<br>\u2022\u202fVSD",

Maintaining high coverage prevents re\u2011importation. <br>\u2022\u202fThe WHO certified the Americas region polio\u2011free in 1994; any lapse in coverage could reverse that status. | \u201cWe vaccinate to keep diseases that we have already driven out from coming back.\u201d |\n| **Provide a predictable, evidence\u2011based schedule** | \u2022\u202fThe U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) review hundreds of studies before recommending a schedule. | \u201cThe schedule is built on the best available science about when the immune system can respond best and when disease risk is highest.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fSafety\u202f\u2014\u202fWhat the data actually show  \n\n### 2.1\u202fOverall safety profile (consensus)\n\n| Metric | Typical findings from large surveillance systems | Interpretation |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Serious adverse events (SAE) per dose** | \u2022\u202fVAERS (U.S. passive reporting) records ~\u202f1\u202fSAE per 100,000 doses, but most are coincidental (e.g., unrelated injuries). <br>\u2022\u202fVaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and the CDC\u2019s \u201cv-safe\u201d active\u2011surveillance program find SAE rates of 0.1\u20130.5 per 100,000 doses for most childhood vaccines. | Extremely rare; causality is established for only a handful of specific reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis). |\n| **Anaphylaxis** | ~\u202f1.3 cases per million doses of mRNA COVID\u201119 vaccine (CDC 2023); for traditional childhood vaccines (e.g., DTaP, MMR) the rate is 0.5\u20131 per million. | Treatable with epinephrine; vaccination sites are required to have emergency equipment. |\n| **Febrile seizures** | \u2022\u202fLive\u2011attenuated vaccines (MMR, varicella) can raise fever 5\u20137\u202fdays after injection; febrile seizure risk \u2248\u202f1 per 2,500\u20133,000 doses of MMR. <br>\u2022\u202fOverall risk of permanent neurologic damage from febrile seizures is <\u202f0.01\u202f%. | Transient, not a contraindication to future doses. |\n| **Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)** | \u2022\u202f",
