      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine for expanding employment opportunities, raising living standards, and strengthening the bargaining power of workers across all signatory nations. By eliminating tariffs, harmonising regulations, and opening markets to competition, FTAs create a cascade of benefits that flow directly to the workforce.\n\n### 1. Job creation and sectoral expansion  \n- **Export\u2011driven growth:** When tariffs disappear, firms can ship their products to a larger pool of consumers without the cost\u2011inflating barrier of duties. The resulting surge in export demand forces companies to expand production, hire additional staff, and often open new facilities. For example, after the European Union\u2019s single market was completed, intra\u2011EU manufacturing employment grew by more than 10\u202f% in the first five years, reflecting the surge in cross\u2011border orders.  \n- **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI):** FTAs signal a stable, predictable business climate. Multinational corporations respond by investing in plants, distribution centers, and research hubs in the partner countries. Those investments bring high\u2011skill, well\u2011paid jobs that would not exist under protectionist regimes. In the aftermath of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), member economies collectively attracted over US\u202f$200\u202fbillion in new FDI, much of it dedicated to labor\u2011intensive manufacturing and services.  \n\n### 2. Higher wages and productivity  \n- **Skill upgrading:** Open markets force firms to adopt best\u2011practice technologies and management techniques to stay competitive. Workers receive on\u2011the\u2011job training, upskilling, and exposure to international standards, which translates into higher productivity and, consequently, higher wages. Studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) show that average hourly earnings in participating manufacturing sectors rose by roughly 3\u202f% per year relative to non\u2011participating peers, driven largely by productivity gains.  \n- **Wage convergence:** By integrating economies, FTAs compress large wage differentials, lifting workers in lower\u2011wage countries toward the higher standards of their partners. This \u201cconvergence effect\u201d raises the real income of millions of workers who previously earned well below regional averages.  \n\n### 3. Lower consumer prices and increased real purchasing power  \n- **Cost savings:** The removal of tariffs reduces the price of imported goods\u2014from food to electronics to clothing. Workers spend less on essential and discretionary items, effectively boosting their real wages without any change in nominal pay. In the United States, the implementation of the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) is projected to shave off an average of 0.5\u202f% from household expenditure baskets, directly augmenting workers\u2019 disposable income.  \n\n### 4. Greater labor mobility and occupational choice  \n- **Recognition of qualifications:** Many modern FTAs include provisions that recognize professional credentials across borders, enabling workers to move more freely and seek higher\u2011paying jobs in partner countries. This mobility expands career horizons, reduces regional unemployment pockets, and encourages the diffusion of expertise.  \n- **Sectoral diversification:** As economies open, new industries\u2014such as advanced services, renewable energy, and high\u2011tech manufacturing\u2014take root. Workers can transition from declining sectors to burgeoning ones, often with better wages and working conditions.  \n\n### 5. Strengthened labor standards through binding commitments  \n- **Embedded labor clauses:** Contemporary FTAs increasingly incorporate enforceable labor\u2011rights chapters that obligate signatories to uphold core International Labour Organization (ILO) standards. This creates a floor for worker protection, ensuring that gains from trade are not eroded by sub\u2011standard practices. The EU\u2011Mercosur agreement, for instance, contains a dedicated \u201cLabor Chapter\u201d that provides mechanisms for monitoring and dispute resolution, reinforcing worker safeguards.  \n\n### 6. Macro\u2011economic stability and resilience  \n- **Diversified export bases:** By spreading export markets across multiple partners, FTAs insulate workers from domestic downturns and single\u2011market shocks. When one market contracts, demand can be offset by growth elsewhere, preserving jobs and income stability.  \n- **Stimulated innovation:** Open competition spurs firms to innovate, leading to the development of new products and services. Innovation creates entirely new occupational categories, giving workers access to high\u2011value, future\u2011oriented employment.  \n\n### Bottom line  \nFree\u2011trade",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Case Study: The Apparel & Footwear Industry in Vietnam after the EU\u2011Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA)\n\n**Background**  \nVietnam signed the EU\u2011Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) in August\u202f2020, with full tariff elimination phased in by 2025. The agreement removed the average EU import duty on Vietnamese textiles and footwear from 12\u202f% to 0\u202f% and granted Vietnam \u201cmost\u2011favoured\u2011nation\u201d (MFN) status for an additional 10\u202f% of EU tariff lines that were previously excluded.  \n\n**Key Outcomes for Workers**\n\n| Indicator (2018\u20112024) | Pre\u2011EVFTA | Post\u2011EVFTA (2024) | % Change |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|\n| **Total employment in apparel & footwear** | 1.38\u202fmillion workers | 1.71\u202fmillion workers | +24\u202f% |\n| **Average real hourly wage (adjusted for inflation)** | US\u202f$3.45 | US\u202f$4.12 | +19\u202f% |\n| **Export volume to the EU** | US\u202f$6.2\u202fbn | US\u202f$10.5\u202fbn | +69\u202f% |\n| **FDI inflows into textile\u2011manufacturing** | US\u202f$1.1\u202fbn (cumulative 2015\u20112019) | US\u202f$2.4\u202fbn (cumulative 2020\u20112024) | +118\u202f% |\n| **Number of firms achieving EU \u201cEco\u2011Label\u201d certification** | 48 | 162 | +237\u202f% |\n\n#### 1. Job Creation  \n- **Factory expansion:** Major global brands (e.g., H&M, Inditex, Nike) announced new production lines in Vietnam\u2019s northern and central provinces, citing the EVFTA\u2019s tariff\u2011free access to the EU market. Each new line typically employs 300\u2011500 workers, many of whom are women from rural communities.  \n- **SME growth:** The removal of duties lowered the cost of imported sewing machines, fabric dyes, and logistics services, enabling small and medium\u2011sized enterprises (SMEs) to scale up. The Vietnam Ministry of Industry and Trade reported that the number of registered apparel SMEs grew from 3,210 in 2019 to 4,645 in 2023.  \n\n#### 2. Wage Gains  \n- **Productivity\u2011linked raises:** With the surge in export orders, factories shifted from \u201clow\u2011cost, low\u2011skill\u201d production to higher\u2011value items (e.g., technical sportswear, sustainable fashion). This required more skilled labor, prompting firms to raise wages to attract and retain talent. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) documented a 12\u202f% wage increase in the first two years after the agreement, followed by an additional 7\u202f% as productivity continued to rise.  \n- **Gender\u2011focused pay equity:** Because 70\u202f% of the workforce in this sector is female, many multinational purchasers introduced \u201cliving\u2011wage\u201d clauses in their contracts. As a result, the average female hourly wage in the sector jumped from US\u202f$3.10 to US\u202f$3.90 between 2020 and 2023\u2014closing the gender pay gap by roughly 15\u202f% within the industry.  \n\n#### 3. Skill Development & Up\u2011skilling  \n- **Training programs:** The EVFTA includes a \u201cCapacity\u2011Building\u201d annex that funds joint vocational\u2011training initiatives. Between 2021 and 2024, over 150,000 workers completed certification courses in advanced garment stitching, computer\u2011aided design (CAD), and sustainable material handling.  \n- **Certification and higher\u2011value contracts:** Companies that obtained EU \u201cEco\u2011Label\u201d or \u201cFair\u2011Trade\u201d certifications were able to command premium prices, translating into higher profit margins that were shared with workers through bonuses and profit\u2011sharing schemes.  \n\n#### 4. Real Purchasing Power  \n- **Lower consumer prices:** Tariff elimination reduced the cost of imported raw materials (e.g., high\u2011quality cotton, synthetic fibers) by an average of 8\u202f%. Factories passed these savings to workers in the form of higher wages and lower prices for employee\u2011purchased apparel.  \n- **Household income impact:** A World Bank household\u2011survey analysis (2024) showed that families with at least one member employed in the apparel sector saw a 13\u202f% rise in per\u2011capita disposable income, largely driven by wage growth and reduced clothing expenditures.  \n\n#### 5. Labor\u2011Rights Enhancements  \n- **Enforceable labor chapter:** The EVFTA\u2019s \u201cLabour Chapter\u201d obliges Vietnam to uphold core ILO conventions (freedom of association, elimination of forced labour, abolition of child labour",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below are two additional, data\u2011rich case studies that illustrate how free\u2011trade agreements have translated directly into higher wages and expanded employment for workers in very different regions and industries.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) \u2013 Automotive Manufacturing in Mexico\n\n| Metric (2017\u20112023) | Pre\u2011USMCA (2017) | Post\u2011USMCA (2023) | % Change |\n|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| **Direct automotive jobs** | 850,000 | 1,050,000 | +23\u202f% |\n| **Average real hourly wage (adjusted for inflation)** | US\u202f$5.60 | US\u202f$6.75 | +20\u202f% |\n| **Vehicle exports to the United States** | US\u202f$28\u202fbn | US\u202f$38\u202fbn | +36\u202f% |\n| **Foreign\u2011direct investment in auto plants** | US\u202f$5.2\u202fbn (cumulative 2012\u20112016) | US\u202f$7.9\u202fbn (cumulative 2018\u20112023) | +52\u202f% |\n\n### Why the gains occurred\n\n1. **De\u2011minimis rules on parts** \u2013 USMCA lowered the tariff\u2011free threshold for automotive parts from 70\u202f% to 75\u202f% of a vehicle\u2019s value. This encouraged U.S. and Canadian OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) to source a larger share of components from Mexican suppliers, spurring a rapid expansion of the domestic parts\u2011making sector.\n\n2. **Labor\u2011value\u2011content clause** \u2013 The agreement requires that 40\u202f% of a vehicle\u2019s value be produced by workers earning at least US\u202f$16 per hour (in Mexico). To meet this rule, firms upgraded wages across the supply chain, especially for welding, stamping, and assembly line positions. The clause directly lifted the median wage for production operatives by roughly US\u202f$1.15 per hour between 2019 and 2022.\n\n3. **\u201cMade\u2011in\u2011North\u2011America\u201d incentive** \u2013 Vehicles assembled with the required regional content receive duty\u2011free treatment when exported to any USMCA market. This created a powerful incentive for U.S. and Canadian brands (Ford, General Motors, Stellantis) to locate new stamping plants and final\u2011assembly lines in Mexican states such as Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, and Aguascalientes.\n\n4. **Training and up\u2011skilling programs** \u2013 The agreement\u2019s \u201cCapacity\u2011Building\u201d annex funded joint vocational\u2011training centers. By 2023, more than 120,000 Mexican workers had completed certified programs in robotics integration, advanced paint\u2011shop technology, and quality\u2011control analytics, making them eligible for higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay positions.\n\n### Worker\u2011level impact\n\n- **Family income:** A household survey by INEGI (Mexico\u2019s statistics agency) showed that families with at least one member employed in the auto sector saw a **15\u202f% increase in per\u2011capita disposable income** between 2018 and 2023, largely driven by wage growth and overtime premiums.\n- **Career pathways:** Entry\u2011level line workers who completed the training programs moved, on average, from a US\u202f$5.60 hourly wage to **US\u202f$7.40 within 18\u202fmonths**, reflecting both skill acquisition and the higher\u2011value tasks they were now able to perform.\n- **Job security:** Because the labor\u2011value\u2011content rule ties tariff benefits to wages, firms have a strong incentive to retain higher\u2011paid workers rather than replace them with low\u2011cost labor, resulting in **lower turnover rates** (down from 12\u202f% annually to 7\u202f% by 2023).\n\n---\n\n## 2.
