      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies processed red meat as a *Group\u202f1* carcinogen (known to cause cancer) and unprocessed red meat as a *Group\u202f2A* carcinogen (probably carcinogenic).**  \n- The strongest and most consistent link is with **colorectal cancer**; smaller\u2011to\u2011moderate associations have also been reported for pancreatic and prostate cancer.  \n- The increase in absolute risk is modest: eating about\u202f50\u202fg of processed meat\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202f\u2013\u202f4 servings per week raises the relative risk of colorectal cancer by roughly **15\u202f%\u201320\u202f%**, which translates to about **1 extra case per 1\u202f000 people** over a lifetime.  \n- The risk appears to rise with **higher total intake**, **frequent consumption of processed meats**, and **high\u2011temperature cooking methods** (grilling, pan\u2011frying, barbecuing) that generate carcinogenic compounds.  \n- Many other lifestyle factors (fiber intake, whole\u2011grain consumption, body weight, alcohol, smoking, physical activity) modify the overall cancer risk, so red\u2011meat consumption is only one piece of the puzzle.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that explains where the data come from, how strong the findings are, and what you can do with the information.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the evidence is gathered\n\n| Study type | What it tells us | Strengths | Limitations |\n|------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| **Prospective cohort studies** (e.g., EPIC, Nurses\u2019 Health Study, Health Professionals Follow\u2011up Study) | Follow large groups for 10\u201130\u202fyears, record diet at baseline (and sometimes updates) and later cancer outcomes. | Large sample sizes, ability to adjust for many confounders, temporal direction (exposure \u2192 outcome). | Dietary assessment is based on food\u2011frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that have measurement error; changes in diet over time may be missed. |\n| **Case\u2011control studies** | Compare past diet of people with cancer (cases) to similar people without cancer (controls). | Efficient for rare cancers, can collect detailed dietary info. | Recall bias (cases may remember diet differently), selection bias. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses & systematic reviews** | Combine results from many studies to estimate overall effect size. | Increase statistical power, assess consistency across populations. | Heterogeneity among studies (different definitions of \u201cred meat\u201d, cooking methods, adjustments). |\n| **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** | Few exist for cancer outcomes (ethical/feasibility limits). Some trials test intermediate biomarkers (e.g., DNA adducts, inflammation). | Randomization removes confounding. | Small sample sizes, short follow\u2011up, surrogate outcomes. |\n\nThe consensus statements from major bodies (WHO, International Agency for Research on Cancer\u202f[IARC], American Cancer Society, US Dietary Guidelines) are based primarily on the **prospective cohort and meta\u2011analysis literature**, because these provide the most reliable long\u2011term risk estimates.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
