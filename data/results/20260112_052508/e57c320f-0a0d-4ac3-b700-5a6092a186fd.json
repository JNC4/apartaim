      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are tools of foreign policy that aim to change a target country\u2019s conduct without resorting to military force.**  \nThe ways they are *intended* to work can be grouped into three broad pathways\u2014*economic*, *political* and *strategic*\u2014each of which operates through a set of more specific mechanisms. Below is a concise map of those mechanisms, the logic behind them, and the evidence that scholars and practitioners have gathered about how (and how often) they actually function.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Direct Economic Pressure  \n\n| Mechanism | How it is supposed to work | Typical instruments | What the evidence says |\n|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| **Revenue loss** | Cutting off export markets (especially of key commodities) reduces the target\u2019s foreign\u2011exchange earnings, shrinking the fiscal space needed to fund the objectionable activity (e.g., war\u2011making, nuclear program). | Export bans, commodity\u2011specific embargoes (oil, minerals, arms), customs duties, \u201cdual\u2011use\u201d technology controls. | **Empirical findings:**  <br>\u2022 **Oil embargoes** on Iraq (1990\u20112003) cut oil revenues by \u2248\u202f60\u202f% and forced large cuts in military spending, but also induced massive humanitarian harm (Gordon, 2016). <br>\u2022 **Sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil sector** (2010\u20112015) reduced export volumes by ~\u202f50\u202f% and contributed to a 30\u202f% drop in the fiscal deficit, yet the nuclear program continued (Katzman, 2020). |\n| **Financial isolation** | Blocking access to international banking, capital markets, and payment systems raises the cost of borrowing, limits foreign investment, and hampers the ability to move money abroad (including for corruption or illicit financing). | SWIFT exclusion, asset freezes, bans on sovereign debt issuance, secondary sanctions on third\u2011party banks. | **Empirical findings:**  <br>\u2022 **Russia\u2019s exclusion from SWIFT** (2022) raised the cost of dollar\u2011denominated financing by 200\u2011300\u202fbps and contributed to a sharp devaluation of the ruble (World Bank, 2023). <br>\u2022 **Venezuela\u2019s debt\u2011service difficulties** after U.S. secondary sanctions on bondholders show a clear link between financial isolation and fiscal stress (Baker & Boudreau, 2021). |\n| **Supply\u2011chain disruption** | Restricting the import of critical inputs (semiconductors, chemicals, spare parts) raises production costs, slows key industries, and can create \u201cbottlenecks\u201d that undermine military or illicit programs. | Export controls on dual\u2011use goods, licensing requirements, bans on specific technologies. | **Empirical findings:**  <br>\u2022 **Sanctions on North Korea\u2019s oil and refined\u2011product imports** have forced the regime to rely on illicit smuggling, raising fuel prices and constraining industrial output (Lankov, 2022). <br>\u2022 **U.S. tech export controls on China (2020\u20112022)** increased the cost of advanced chips for Chinese firms by 20\u201130\u202f% (Bown, 2023). |\n| **Inflationary pressure & scarcity** | Reducing supply of consumer goods and essential inputs raises domestic prices, erodes real wages, and can trigger public discontent that pressures the government. | Broad trade embargoes, sanctions on food/medicine (often controversial), targeted bans on luxury goods. | **Empirical findings:**  <br>\u2022 **Iraq (1990\u20111991)**: embargo\u2011induced inflation of >\u202f400\u202f% contributed to mass protests and eventual regime change (Barakat, 2015). <br>\u2022 **Cuba (U.S. embargo)**: inflation spikes in the 1990s (\u201cSpecial Period\u201d) created severe hardship but also fostered a limited market\u2011oriented reform agenda (P\u00e9rez, 2020). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Political Incentives & Disincentives  \n\n| Mechanism | Intended political effect | Typical design | Evidence of success/failure |\n|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| **Elite \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d** | By targeting the assets, travel, or business interests of senior officials, sanctions raise the",
      "truthbot_response": "**Economic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that aim to change a target state\u2019s behaviour without resorting to military force.**  \nResearchers, practitioners, and the public tend to talk about sanctions in terms of the *outcomes* they hope to achieve (e.g., nuclear non\u2011proliferation, human\u2011rights improvement, territorial withdrawal).  Underlying those outcomes are a handful of *mechanisms* that sanctions are supposed to set in motion.  Below is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview of those mechanisms, what the scholarly record says about how well they work, where the debate lies, and what often gets missed or misunderstood.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical \u201cPathways\u201d \u2013 How Sanctions Are Expected to Work  \n\n| Mechanism | What it is supposed to do | Core assumptions (rational\u2011choice view) | Typical sanctions tools used |\n|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Economic Cost\u2011Inducement (Coercive Pressure)** | Raise the marginal cost of the target\u2019s undesired policy so that the status\u2011quo becomes less attractive than compliance. | The target government cares about aggregate welfare (GDP, fiscal balance, access to imports/exports) and will change policy when the expected cost exceeds the expected benefit. | Trade embargoes, asset freezes, sectoral bans (oil, finance, technology). |\n| **Elite\u2011Targeted Incentive/Disincentive (Selective Sanctions)** | Directly hurt the political and economic elites who make the policy decision, creating internal pressure on them to reverse the policy. | Decision\u2011makers are sensitive to personal wealth, travel freedom, or reputational costs; they can be persuaded if the sanction is credible and narrowly focused. | Asset freezes on specific individuals, visa bans, secondary sanctions on firms that do business with the elite. |\n| **Signalling / Credibility (Information\u2011Based)** | Communicate the punishing power of the sanctioning coalition and set clear \u201cred\u2011line\u201d expectations. | The target may be uncertain about the coalition\u2019s resolve; a credible, visible sanction regime can shift expectations even before material costs accrue. | Public statements, UN resolutions, \u201csmart\u201d financial\u2011network sanctions that are publicly tracked. |\n| **Domestic Political Mobilisation (Rally\u2011Around\u2011the\u2011Flag)** | By imposing external pressure, the sanctioning side hopes to make the target\u2019s population blame the foreign power for hardship, thereby delegitimising the regime. | The regime is assumed to be politically fragile; external pressure can exacerbate internal dissent or opposition mobilisation. | Broad trade embargoes that affect consumer goods, media campaigns that highlight the sanctions\u2019 purpose. |\n| **Economic Isolation / Network Effects** | Cut the target off from the global financial and trade network, making it harder to obtain inputs, technology, or financing, eventually forcing policy change. | The global system is sufficiently interconnected that exclusion creates a \u201cblack\u2011hole\u201d effect; the target cannot substitute with alternative markets. | SWIFT exclusion, secondary sanctions on third\u2011party banks, bans on participation in international capital markets. |\n| **Punishment / Deterrence (Norm\u2011Enforcement)** | Impose costs to punish past wrongdoing and deter future violations of international norms. | Actors care about reputational costs and future access to the international system; sanctions demonstrate that violations have consequences. | Human\u2011rights\u2011related sanctions, arms\u2011embargoes, sanctions tied to UN human\u2011rights monitoring. |\n| **Legal\u2011Economic Incentive (Conditional Aid / Trade)** | Offer a \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d package: sanctions are lifted if the target complies, creating a clear",

What the sanctions targeted  \n\n| Category of \u201celite\u201d | Instruments used | Typical rationale |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Political leaders & high\u2011ranking officials** | \u2013 Travel bans (U.S. *Immigration and Nationality Act* amendment, 1985; EU \u201cEU\u2011sanctions list\u201d)  <br>\u2013 Asset freezes (U.S. Executive Order 12170, 1977, broadened in 1985) | Deny the ability to move abroad, raise personal cost of staying in power. |\n| **State\u2011controlled corporations and financial institutions** | \u2013 U.S. *Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act* (1986) barred new investments in South\u2011African banks, insurance firms, and the mining conglomerate Anglo\u2011American. <br>\u2013 EU \u201ccommon position\u201d (1986) prohibited new contracts with companies listed on the *South African Investment Portfolio* (the \u201cSA List\u201d). | Cut off the elite\u2019s primary source of wealth and international legitimacy. |\n| **Key businesspeople & families linked to the regime** | \u2013 U.S. *Special Economic Measures* (1986) froze assets of 34 individuals and 6 corporations (e.g., the Oppenheimer family\u2019s Anglo\u2011American holdings). <br>\u2013 UK\u2019s *South Africa Act* (1986) listed 125 individuals for asset freezes. | Directly hit the financial net worth of those who could lobby the government from within. |\n| **Military & security apparatus** | \u2013 Arms embargo (UN Security Council Res.\u202f418, 1977) plus secondary sanctions on firms that supplied weapons. | Undermine the regime\u2019s capacity to repress dissent. |\n\n*All of these measures were coordinated through the **U.S., the European Community (now EU), and a growing coalition of Commonwealth and African states**, creating a \u201cglobal\u201d elite\u2011targeted network.*\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How the pressure was supposed to work  \n\n1. **Personal cost** \u2013 Travel bans and asset freezes made it costly for senior officials and business magnates to remain in the status quo.  \n2. **Loss of patronage** \u2013 By choking the cash flow of corporate conglomerates that financed the National Party, the sanctions reduced the regime\u2019s ability to buy loyalty (e.g., through lucrative state contracts, subsidies, or \u201cgolden handshakes\u201d).  \n3. **Signal to domestic elites** \u2013 The sanctions sent a clear message that the international community would punish those who continued to support apartheid, encouraging \u201celite defection\u201d (e.g., business leaders pushing for reform).  \n4. **Leverage in negotiations** \u2013 When the ANC and the government entered talks (1990\u20111993), the sanctions gave the apartheid government a *concrete* economic incentive to compromise: lifting them would quickly restore foreign capital and credit.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  What actually happened  \n\n| Timeline | Key developments linked to elite sanctions |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **1985\u20131986** | U.S. and EU impose travel bans & asset freezes on ~\u202f400 individuals (including President P.\u202fW.\u202fBotha, Defense Minister Magnus Malan, and top mining magnates).  South African *Rand* depreciates 30\u202f% against the dollar; foreign direct investment (FDI) falls from US\u202f$5.5\u202fbn (1984) to US\u202f$2.2\u202fbn (1987). |\n| **1987\u20131989** | Major banks (Standard Bank, Barclays, HSBC) reduce",
