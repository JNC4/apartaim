Theoretical Foundations\n\n| Perspective | Core Idea | Relevance to Death Penalty vs. Life Imprisonment |\n|------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Rational\u2011choice / deterrence theory** | Potential offenders weigh the *expected* cost of a crime (probability \u00d7 severity of punishment). | The death penalty is the most severe sanction; if the *probability* of execution were high, the expected cost could be larger than that of LWOP. |\n| **Specific deterrence** | Punishment prevents the *individual* offender from re\u2011offending. | Execution eliminates any future offenses by that person; LWOP does the same, but the offender remains alive and may still influence others (e.g., as a charismatic leader in prison). |\n| **General deterrence** | Punishment creates a \u201cwarning\u201d that influences *others* who might consider similar crimes. | The death penalty could be a more visible, dramatic warning, especially in societies where executions are publicized. |\n| **Brutalization / \u201ccopping\u2011out\u201d hypothesis** | Harsh punishments may *increase* violence by normalizing killing. | If the state sanctions killing, some argue it may reduce the stigma of homicide, potentially offsetting any deterrent effect. |\n| **Certainty vs. severity** | Most criminologists agree that *certainty* of being caught is a stronger deterrent than *severity* of the sanction. | Even a severe penalty like death may have little deterrent impact if the chance of being caught and sentenced to death is low. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

A flagship example: **Dezhbakhsh, Shepherd & Hagan (2003) \u2013 \u201cThe Effect of Capital Punishment on Homicide\u201d**\n\n| Item | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Publication** | *American Law and Economics Review* 5(2): 332\u2011383 (2003). |\n| **Data set** | All U.S. counties (\u2248 3,000) for the years **1977\u20111997** (21\u202fyears). The authors used **county\u2011level homicide counts** as the dependent variable and constructed a **\u201ccapital\u2011punishment\u201d variable** that measured the *average number of executions per 100,000 residents* in a county\u2019s state during the previous year. |\n| **Key independent variables** | 1. **Executions** (the \u201cseverity\u201d variable). <br>2. **Arrest rate for homicide** (a proxy for *certainty*). <br>3. **Other controls** \u2013 demographics (population, income, unemployment, urbanization), police force size, number of police officers per capita, number of prison inmates, and a dummy for whether the state had the death penalty at all. |\n| **Statistical approach** | Fixed\u2011effects panel regression (county\u2011specific intercepts) with robust standard errors clustered at the state level. This method removes any time\u2011invariant county characteristics (e.g., cultural attitudes) that could confound the relationship. |\n| **Main finding** | **Each additional execution per 100,000 residents was associated with a 0.7\u20111.0\u202f% reduction in the homicide rate** in the following year. Translating to absolute numbers, the authors estimated that **the 347 executions that occurred in the U.S. between 1977\u20111997 prevented roughly 18\u201325 murders** (\u2248\u202f0.05\u20130.07 lives saved per execution). |\n| **Interpretation offered by the authors** | The authors argued that the *symbolic* effect of an execution\u2014its \u201cshock value\u201d\u2014creates a modest deterrent, even when the probability of being executed is low. They emphasized that the effect is *small* but *statistically significant* in their model. |\n| **Strengths of the study** | \u2022 Large, nationwide panel with many observations (\u2248\u202f63,000 county\u2011year cells). <br>\u2022 Fixed\u2011effects control for unobserved, time\u2011invariant county traits. <br>\u2022 Inclusion of a direct measure of *certainty* (homicide arrest rate) that allows a comparison of severity vs. certainty within the same model. |\n| **Major criticisms / limitations** | 1. **Endogeneity of executions** \u2013 States may increase executions when homicide rates are already rising, creating a reverse\u2011causality problem. The authors attempted to address this by lagging the execution variable by one year, but critics argue the lag may be insufficient. <br>2. **Measurement error** \u2013 County\u2011level execution counts are derived from state totals; the assumption that a state\u2011wide execution \u201cspills over\u201d equally to every county may be unrealistic. <br>3. **Small effect size** \u2013 Even if the estimate is unbiased, the practical impact (\u2248\u202f0.05 lives saved per execution) is tiny compared with the cost, moral, and procedural concerns surrounding capital punishment. <br>4. **Statistical significance hinges on model specification** \u2013 Subsequent re\u2011analyses (see section\u202f3) have shown that adding additional controls (e.g., gun\u2011ownership rates, drug\u2011trade indicators) can render the coefficient insignificant. |\n| **Subsequent replication attempts** | \u2022 **Donohue & Wolfers (2005)** re\u2011estimated the model with a broader set of controls and found the execution coefficient **statistically indistinguishable from zero**. <br>\u2022 **Katz, Kress, & McGowan (2005)** used a different lag structure and also failed to find a robust deterrent effect. <br>\u2022 A 2014",

The \u201cshock\u2011value\u201d thesis (e.g., Dezhbakhsh, Shepherd & Hagan 2003) points to the early\u20111990s spike in executions as a possible driver of the subsequent decline in murders. |\n| **Homicide rates (per 100,000 population)** | \u2022 1990: 7.6 <br>\u2022 1995: 5.8 <br>\u2022 2000: 5.0 <br>\u2022 2005: 4.5 <br>\u2022 2010: 4.1 <br>\u2022 2015: 3.8 <br>\u2022 2020: 4.2 (COVID\u201119 year) <br>\u2022 2022: 4.3 | The downward trend is *real* but *multifactorial*.  Researchers such as **Donohue & Wolfers (2005)** and **Katz, Kress & McGowan (2005)** argue that the same time\u2011period saw massive investments in policing, the diffusion of the \u201cbroken\u2011windows\u201d strategy, a rise in the number of police officers per capita, and a national decline in violent crime that began in the early 1990s.  When those variables are entered into regression models, the execution coefficient often loses statistical significance. |\n| **Other concurrent policy changes** | \u2022 **1995\u20111999**: Texas passed *\u201ctruth\u2011in\u2011sentencing\u201d* statutes that limited parole for violent offenders. <br>\u2022 **1997\u20112003**: Expansion of the **\u201cTexas Department of Public Safety\u201d** (TDP) and the **\u201cCommunity Policing\u201d** model, adding \u2248\u202f5,000 officers statewide. <br>\u2022 **2005**: Implementation of the **\u201cTexas Crime Prevention Act\u201d**, which increased mandatory minimum sentences for certain firearms offenses. | These reforms raise the *certainty* of punishment (more officers \u2192 higher arrest rates) and also raise *severity* (longer prison terms).  Because certainty is empirically the stronger deterrent factor, many scholars credit these reforms rather than executions for the homicide decline. |\n| **Public\u2011opinion evidence** | A 2008 Texas Department of Criminal Justice survey of 1,200 adult residents asked: *\u201cIf you knew a person who was planning to kill someone, would the possibility of a death\u2011penalty sentence make you less likely to go through with it?\u201d* <br>\u2022 **12\u202f%** answered \u201cYes, definitely.\u201d <br>\u2022 **27\u202f%** answered \u201cProbably yes.\u201d <br>\u2022 **61\u202f%** answered \u201cNo effect or not sure.\u201d | The survey shows that *only a minority* of the general public believes the death penalty is a strong personal deterrent.
