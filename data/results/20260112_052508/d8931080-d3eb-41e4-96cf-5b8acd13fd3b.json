International guidelines (ICNIRP\u202f2020, IEEE\u202f2020, FCC\u202f2023) set limits well below levels that produce measurable temperature rises in the body. | The consensus is that everyday exposure from 5G antennas is **far** below the threshold for any thermal effect. |\n| **Non\u2011thermal biological effects** | Hundreds of laboratory studies have examined endpoints such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, or cell signalling at exposure levels **below** guideline limits. Systematic reviews (e.g., World Health Organization\u202f2022, BioInitiative Report\u202f2021, NTP\u202f2022) conclude that results are **inconsistent**, often not reproducible, and generally lack a plausible mechanism. | No credible evidence that low\u2011level RF exposure produces a biologically meaningful non\u2011thermal effect. |\n| **Cancer risk** | \u2022 *Epidemiology*: Large cohort studies (e.g., the Danish Cohort, the Million Women Study, the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) rat study, the French CERENAT case\u2011control study) have found **no increased risk** of glioma, meningioma, or other cancers linked to residential or occupational RF exposure. <br>\u2022 *IARC classification*: In 2011 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified RF electromagnetic fields as **\u201cpossibly carcinogenic (Group\u202f2B)\u201d** \u2013 a category that also includes coffee and pickled vegetables, reflecting limited evidence in humans and inadequate evidence in animals. <br>\u2022 *5G\u2011specific data*: As of 2026, there are **no peer\u2011reviewed epidemiological studies** that isolate 5G frequencies; the existing studies mainly cover 2G/3G/4G bands (\u2264\u202f6\u202fGHz). | The weight of evidence still points to **no causal link** between typical environmental RF exposure (including the frequencies used for 5G) and cancer. The IARC rating is precautionary, not a declaration of danger. |\n| **Reproductive & developmental outcomes** | Human studies on",
      "truthbot_response": "**TL;DR** \u2013  \n*The health worries that most people raise about 5G\u2011cell\u2011tower (and broader 5G) radio\u2011frequency (RF) radiation are: (1) cancer (especially brain tumours), (2) non\u2011cancer neurological or \u201celectrosensitivity\u201d symptoms, (3) reproductive or developmental harm, and (4) general \u201cunknown\u2011long\u2011term\u201d effects from the higher frequencies and denser network that 5G uses.*  \n\n*All major national and international health agencies that have reviewed the peer\u2011reviewed literature (WHO, IARC, ICNIRP, FCC/OST, FDA, European SCENIHR, Health Canada, Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, etc.) conclude that **there is no credible evidence that exposure to 5G\u2011level RF fields below the established safety limits causes any of these health problems**. The only formal \u201chazard classification\u201d that exists is the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s (IARC) Group\u202f2B \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d rating for *all* radio\u2011frequency electromagnetic fields, which is based on limited epidemiological data from older (pre\u20115G) technologies and does not imply a proven risk. The consensus is therefore that 5G, as currently deployed, is **unlikely to be a health hazard**; the remaining uncertainties are about *very* low\u2011level, long\u2011term exposure and about effects that have not yet been studied in depth (e.g., chronic skin exposure to millimetre\u2011wave (mm\u2011wave) band).*\n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of each concern, the strongest studies on both sides, and where the scientific community stands.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
