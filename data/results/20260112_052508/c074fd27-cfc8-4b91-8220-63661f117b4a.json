      "unknown_model_response": "**Current scientific understanding**\n\nLarge\u2011scale prospective cohort studies and meta\u2011analyses have consistently shown that higher intakes of red and especially processed meat are associated with a modestly increased risk of colorectal cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies **processed meat** as *carcinogenic to humans* (Group\u202f1) and **red meat** as *probably carcinogenic* (Group\u202f2A).  \n\nA frequently cited figure comes from a pooled analysis of more than 1\u202fmillion participants (World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research, 2018). The authors estimated that **each additional 100\u202fg of processed meat eaten daily is associated with about a 17\u202f% higher risk of colorectal cancer**. For unprocessed red meat, the risk increase is smaller\u2014roughly a 6\u20138\u202f% rise per 100\u202fg/day\u2014but it is still statistically detectable in many studies.\n\n**What \u201c17\u202f% increased risk\u201d means in practice**\n\n- **Baseline risk**: In the United States, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 4\u20135\u202f% (roughly 1 in 20 people).  \n- **Adding 100\u202fg of processed meat per day**: A 17\u202f% relative increase would raise that lifetime risk to about 4.7\u20135.9\u202f% (an absolute increase of ~0.7\u20131\u202fpercentage point).  \n- **Putting it in everyday terms**: Eating a typical serving of processed meat (e.g., two slices of bacon, a hot dog, or a small portion of salami) every day for many years would shift the risk upward by roughly that amount compared with someone who never eats processed meat, assuming all other lifestyle factors are equal.\n\n**Cooking methods that can amplify the risk**\n\nThe way meat is cooked influences the formation of carcinogenic compounds:\n\n| Cooking method | Typical temperature | Key carcinogenic compounds formed |\n|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Grilling/Barbecuing (direct flame)** | > 250\u202f\u00b0C (482\u202f\u00b0F) | Heteroc",

The absolute difference is modest, but it accumulates if the habit is lifelong. |\n| **Putting it in weekly terms** | The **WCRF/AICR recommendation** of \u2264\u202f500\u202fg cooked red meat per week equals **\u2248\u202f70\u202fg per day**.

This is why the guideline frames the limit as \u201cmoderation\u201d rather than \u201cavoid\u201d. |\n\n> **Key point:** The 17\u202f% figure is a *relative* risk.  In absolute terms, for a disease that already has a modest baseline incidence, the extra risk translates to **less than one additional case per 100 people** even when the highest\u2011risk amount (100\u202fg/d) is consumed every day for a lifetime.  The same calculation applied to *unprocessed* red meat yields a smaller absolute increase (\u2248\u202f0.5\u20130.8\u202f% absolute lifetime risk).\n\n---\n\n## 2.
