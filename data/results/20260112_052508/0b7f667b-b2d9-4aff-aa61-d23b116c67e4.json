I have grouped the material into\u202ffour sections:\n\n1. **Theoretical logic & intended mechanisms**  \n2. **What the empirical literature finds (consensus and dissent)**  \n3. **Key variables that explain why sanctions sometimes work and sometimes fail**  \n4. **Points of genuine uncertainty and why scholars disagree**\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Theoretical logic \u2013 how sanctions are supposed to change behavior\n\n| Step | Description | Typical assumptions |\n|------|-------------|----------------------|\n| **a. Cost imposition** | Sanctions raise the *economic* cost of continuing a particular policy (e.g., by cutting off trade, finance, or investment). | The target relies on the blocked flows for revenue, imports of essential inputs, or access to the international financial system. |\n| **b. Incentive shift** | Higher costs make the *utility* of the unwanted behavior lower than the utility of compliance or negotiation. | Decision\u2011makers are rational, can weigh costs vs. benefits, and have the ability to alter policy. |\n| **c. Credibility & signaling** | Sanctions demonstrate the *resolve* of the imposing coalition and signal that further costs will follow if the target does not change. | The target believes the threat of escalation is credible (i.e., sanctions will be maintained or intensified). |\n| **d. Domestic pressure** | Economic pain creates internal dissent (protests, elite defections, elite elite\u2011elite bargaining) that forces leaders to reconsider their stance. | The political system is at least partially responsive to public or elite pressure; there are no strong \u201crally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag\u201d dynamics that completely mute dissent. |\n| **e. International isolation** | By cutting the target off from the global system, sanctions can erode the legitimacy of the regime and reduce its ability to pursue the objectionable policy. | Other states (especially allies) comply with the sanction regime, limiting avenues for sanction\u2011busting. |\n\n### Two broad strategic aims\n\n| **Coercive sanctions** | **Norm\u2011oriented / signaling sanctions** |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| *Goal*: force a concrete policy change (e.g., stop nuclear weapons, withdraw troops). | *Goal*: express condemnation, stigmatize a behavior, or reinforce international norms (e.g., human\u2011rights violations). |\n| *Success metric*: observable policy reversal or concession. | *Success metric*: diplomatic isolation, reputational damage, or reinforcement of a normative standard, even if the policy itself does not change. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Theoretical logic behind sanctions  \n\n| Step in the logic | What scholars say it should do | Key references |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Impose a cost** | By cutting off trade, finance, or investment, sanctions raise the economic price of the target\u2019s current policy. | Galtung\u202f(1967); Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f(2007) |\n| **Create a dilemma for the target** | A rational decision\u2011maker compares the *cost of compliance* (changing policy) with the *cost of non\u2011compliance* (economic loss, political fallout). | Pape\u202f(1997); Baldwin\u202f(1985) |\n| **Signal resolve & credibility** | Sanctions are a \u201ccredibility\u2011building\u201d tool; they tell the target that the sanctioning country will follow through with further measures if demands are ignored. | Drezner\u202f(2011); Keohane & Nye\u202f1977 |\n| **Pressure elite or domestic constituencies** | By hurting the economy (or specific sectors/individuals), sanctions can erode elite support for a policy or raise public discontent, forcing leaders to change. | Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f(2007); Giumelli\u202f(2020) |\n| **Provide a diplomatic \u201cexit\u201d** | Sanctions allow the coercer to punish without using force, preserving a \u201cpeaceful\u201d alternative. | Baldwin\u202f(1985); Early\u202f&\u202fSnyder\u202f(2021) |\n\n*Note*: The above chain assumes the target behaves like a **rational actor** that cares about material costs. Many scholars point out that **non\u2011rational**, identity\u2011based, or regime\u2011survival motives can break the chain (e.g., authoritarian leaders may prioritize regime survival over economic welfare).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

I walk through the timeline, the specific measures that were applied, the mechanisms that scholars say made the pressure work, and the evidence that the sanctions actually contributed to the policy change.  I also note the limits of the case (what sanctions alone did *not* achieve) so you can see why the story is sometimes used as a \u201csuccess model\u201d while still being debated.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Background \u2013 What the world was trying to change\n\n| Issue | What the target (the South African government) was doing | International demand |\n|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Apartheid** \u2013 a system of racial segregation and political domination of the Black majority by a white\u2011minority government. | Racial classification, forced removals, denial of voting rights, repression of anti\u2011apartheid movements. | End the system, release political prisoners, allow universal suffrage, dismantle discriminatory laws. |\n\nBy the mid\u20111980s the anti\u2011apartheid movement had become a global moral cause.  Governments, churches, trade unions, and civil\u2011society groups called for \u201ceconomic pressure\u201d to force the regime to negotiate.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The sanction package \u2013 what was actually imposed?\n\n| Year | Actor(s) | Main measures (what they cut off) | Scope |\n|------|----------|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| **1977\u20111985** | United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions 418 & 421 (mandatory arms embargo) | Arms sales, military equipment, dual\u2011use technology. | *All UN member states* (mandatory). |\n| **1985** | United States (Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act, passed over Reagan\u2019s veto) | Ban on new investment, prohibition on imports of certain minerals (e.g., gold, platinum), restrictions on bank loans. | *U.S. companies & financial institutions*; also secondary sanctions on non\u2011U.S. firms dealing with SA. |\n| **1986\u20111989** | European Economic Community (EEC) | Prohibition on new investment, bans on trade in coal, steel, iron, and certain agricultural products; restrictions on financial services. | *All EEC member states* (binding by EU law). |\n| **1986\u20111990** | Commonwealth & many individual countries (UK, Canada, Australia, Norway, etc.) | Voluntary \u201cboycott\u201d of South\u2011African goods, bans on sporting contacts, cultural embargoes, divestment campaigns targeting corporate holdings. | *Targeted* but created a global stigma. |\n| **1985\u20111990** | Global civil\u2011society (churches, unions, universities) | **Divestment campaigns** that pressured pension funds, university endowments, and private corporations to sell SA holdings. | *Financial pressure on multinational corporations* (e.g., Shell, BP, Anglo American). |\n\n> **Key point:**  The sanctions were **multilayered** \u2013 a *legal* core (UN arms embargo, U.S./EEC trade bans) plus a *political* and *financial* periphery (divestment, cultural boycotts).  This combination is what most scholars cite as the decisive factor.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How the sanctions translated into pressure on the regime \u2013 the mechanisms at work\n\n| Mechanism | Evidence from the South\u2011African case |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------|\n| **a. Macro\u2011economic cost** | By 1989 South Africa\u2019s **foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by ~40\u202f%** from its 1984 peak; the **balance of payments deficit widened** (from a $2\u202fbn surplus in 1984 to a $3\u202fbn deficit in 1989).  The government reported that sanctions \u201ccrippled the economy\u201d and forced it to cut public spending. |\n| **b. Revenue loss from commodity exports** | **Gold and platinum exports**\u2014the two biggest earners\u2014declined sharply after the U.S. and EU bans on new contracts.  The value of gold exports fell from **US$4.4\u202fbn (1985)** to **US$2.2\u202fbn (1989)**.  The government had to raise taxes and borrow more, increasing its fiscal vulnerability. |\n| **c. Elite financial pressure** | Major mining companies (e.g., **Anglo American**, **De Beers**, **Shell**) faced shareholder activism;",

South Africa \u2013 Apartheid (1980s\u2011early\u20111990s)\n\n| Element | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Sanctioning coalition** | United Nations (UN\u2011SC Res.\u202f418, 1977) \u2192 mandatory oil\u2011embargo; later a broad **multilateral** sanctions regime led by the United States, European Community, and many Commonwealth nations (e.g., 1986 U.S. Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act, EU \u201canti\u2011apartheid\u201d measures). |\n| **Tools** | \u2022 Oil and petroleum embargo (UN).<br>\u2022 Ban on new investment, arms sales, and mining equipment.<br>\u2022 Restrictions on South African banks in the global financial system.<br>\u2022 Sports and cultural boycotts (non\u2011economic but complementary). |\n| **Target demand** | End the system of institutional racial segregation and grant political rights to the black majority. |\n| **Outcome** | \u2022 **Economic impact**: South Africa\u2019s oil imports fell by ~30\u202f% (1979\u20111985); foreign direct investment (FDI) dropped from US\u202f$5.2\u202fbn (1979) to US\u202f$1.8\u202fbn (1989). GDP growth slowed from an average of 4.5\u202f% (1975\u201179) to 1.5\u202f% (1985\u201190).<br>\u2022 **Political shift**: In 1990 President\u202fF.\u202fW.\u202fde\u202fKlerk announced the release of Nelson\u202fMandela and the unbanning of anti\u2011apartheid parties; a negotiated transition began, culminating in the 1994 democratic election. |\n| **Scholarly consensus** | **Strong** \u2013 a majority of quantitative and qualitative studies attribute the *timing* of the political reforms to the cumulative pressure of sanctions combined with internal resistance. <br>\u2022 **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007)**, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*, rank the South\u2011African case as the *most successful* of 180+ cases they examined. <br>\u2022 **Kerr (1995)** and **Sullivan (2003)** argue that sanctions raised the *costs of apartheid* to the white business elite, making continued segregation untenable. |\n| **Key caveats / contested points** | \u2022 **Domestic resistance** (mass protests, labor strikes) was also decisive; some scholars (e.g., **Baker, 2015**) contend that internal mobilization, not sanctions, was the proximate cause. <br>\u2022 **Timing**: Sanctions peaked in the mid\u201180s, while negotiations began only after 1990; critics claim the *lag* weakens a direct causal claim. <br>\u2022 **International isolation** (sports, cultural boycotts) may have mattered as much as the economic measures. |\n| **Why it is often cited** | The case satisfies the classic \u201ccost\u2011vs\u2011compliance\u201d logic: the *white minority elite* faced sharp economic losses (especially in mining & finance) and lost access to crucial technology, prompting a policy reversal. It also offers a *clear* pre\u2011 and post\u2011sanction policy change. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
