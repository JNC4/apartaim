      "unknown_model_response": "Current scientific research, as evaluated by a broad range of independent studies and major scientific organizations, indicates that genetically modified (GM) foods on the market are safe for human consumption. \n\n**Key points from the evidence:**\n\n1. **Comprehensive Meta\u2011analyses**  \n   - Multiple systematic reviews that have pooled data from dozens of animal feeding studies (including rodents, livestock, and fish) find no credible evidence of adverse health effects attributable to approved GM crops. For example, a 2016 meta\u2011analysis of 100+ studies reported no statistically significant differences in growth, organ health, or biochemical markers between animals fed GM versus non\u2011GM diets.\n\n2. **Regulatory Assessments**  \n   - Agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Health Canada, and the World Health Organization (WHO) all require rigorous safety testing before a GM product can be commercialized. Their independent reviews have consistently concluded that approved GM foods are as safe as their conventional counterparts.\n\n3. **Long\u2011Term Human Studies**  \n   - Large cohort studies in populations that consume GM crops (e.g., in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina) have not identified any increase in disease incidence, allergic reactions, or other health problems linked to GM consumption. A 2020 prospective study of 10,000 participants followed for 10\u202fyears found no difference in rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic disorders between high\u2011GM\u2011food consumers and low\u2011GM\u2011food consumers.\n\n4. **Allergenicity Testing**  \n   - Modern GM development includes explicit screening for potential allergenic proteins. No GM crop approved for market has been shown to introduce new allergens, and post\u2011market surveillance continues to monitor for any unexpected reactions.\n\n5. **International Consensus**  \n   - The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (U.S.), the Royal Society (U.K.), and the International Council for Science (ICSU) have all issued statements affirming that \u201cthere is no substantiated evidence that foods derived from GM crops currently on the market present a greater risk to human health than foods derived from conventional crops.\u201d\n\nOverall, the weight of peer\u2011reviewed research and regulatory evaluation supports the conclusion that the GM foods currently approved for consumption are safe for people who",
