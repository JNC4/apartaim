Systematic reviews (e.g., *World Allergy Organization Journal* 2020) find **no high\u2011quality evidence** that raw milk prevents these conditions; some observational studies show an association but are confounded by farm\u2011environment exposures. | Pasteurized milk can be fortified with vitamin\u202fD, vitamin\u202fA, and probiotic cultures (added after pasteurization), delivering the claimed health benefits without the pathogen risk. |\n\n---\n\n### 1.

      "unknown_model_response": "### How the industry verifies that pasteurised milk is safe  \n\nAfter the milk has gone through the heat\u2011treatment step, processors use a **layered safety system** that combines (1) built\u2011in process controls, (2) rapid on\u2011line tests, and (3) periodic laboratory verification.  The goal is to be\u202fcertain that the \u201clog\u2011kill\u201d promised by pasteurisation actually occurred and that no new contamination entered the product afterward.\n\n| Step | What is measured | Why it matters | Typical acceptance limit |\n|------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **1. Process\u2011control monitoring** (inside the pasteuriser) | *Time\u2011temperature profile* recorded by calibrated thermocouples and flow meters. | Guarantees every batch receives the required heat dose (e.g., 72\u202f\u00b0C\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202f\u00b0C for at least 15\u202fs for HTST). | Must meet the regulatory specification for the chosen pasteurisation regime (e.g., \u22655\u2011log reduction of *Coxiella burnetii*). |\n| **2. Immediate post\u2011process test \u2013 Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)** | Enzyme activity measured in the milk that survives only if the milk was **not** heated to pasteurisation temperature. | ALP is heat\u2011stable enough to survive the standard HTST conditions only when the milk is under\u2011processed. A **negative** ALP test \u2192 confidence that the heat\u2011kill was achieved. | ALP activity **\u2264\u202f350\u202fmU/L** (U.S. FDA/FSIS) or **\u2264\u202f150\u202fmU/L** (EU) for HTST milk. UHT milk is tested for *thermostable* ALP and must be **\u2264\u202f0\u202fmU/L**. |\n| **3. Routine microbiological plate counts** | Total aerobic plate count (APC) and coliform count performed on a random sample of each lot. | Shows overall hygiene and helps detect post\u2011process contamination (e.g., from equipment, packaging). | APC \u2264\u202f100\u202f000\u202fCFU/mL for fluid milk (U.S. standard); coliforms \u2264\u202f10\u202fCFU/mL. |\n| **4. Pathogen\u2011specific surveillance** (periodic, not per\u2011batch) | PCR or culture for *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Salmonella spp.*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter*, *Staphylococcus aureus* enterotoxin. | Even though pasteurisation should inactivate these, they can be introduced **after** the heat step (e.g., during filling). Testing catches those rare events. | Must be **absent** in the tested sample (e.g., 25\u202fg or 25\u202fmL). |\n| **5. HACCP verification & environmental monitoring** | Swabs of processing surfaces, air filters, filler nozzles; verification that sanitation SOPs are followed. | Prevents cross\u2011contamination from the plant environment. | No detection of the target pathogens in a defined number of samples (e.g., 0/20). |\n| **6. Traceability & recall readiness** | Batch numbers linked to raw\u2011milk source, processing lot, packaging line. | Enables rapid removal of any product that later fails a test or is linked to an illness. | System must allow recall within 24\u202fh of a confirmed problem. |\n\n**Key point:** The **Alkaline Phosphatase test** is the fastest \u201cgo\u2011no\u2011go\u201d check. It can be performed in seconds on the production line",

The sample was **not** a product test but a swab of a filler nozzle that is taken **daily** as part of the plant\u2019s HACCP verification program. | The plant\u2019s internal microbiology lab performed a **real\u2011time PCR (ISO\u202f16649\u20111/ISO\u202f11290\u20111) on the swab**. The PCR flagged the presence of *L. monocytogenes* DNA within a few hours. | Because *Listeria* is a **zero\u2011tolerance** organism in ready\u2011to\u2011eat foods, the positive result automatically triggered a **hold** on the entire production line. A confirmatory culture (the gold\u2011standard) later grew *L. monocytogenes* from the same swab, confirming that live bacteria were present. | The company voluntarily **recalled** all cartons from the affected lot (\u2248\u202f1.5\u202fmillion\u202fL of milk) and shut the line for deep cleaning and re\u2011validation. No illnesses were reported, because the product never left the plant. The recall was announced the same day the PCR result was confirmed, illustrating how a rapid post\u2011process test can stop a potential outbreak before any consumer exposure. |\n\n**Why this example matters**\n\n* The detection was **after** the milk had been pasteurised and packaged, proving that the heat step itself was not the problem; the risk came from **post\u2011process contamination**.\n* The **PCR screening** gave a result in <\u202f4\u202fh, allowing the company to act before the product entered the distribution chain.\n* Regulatory agencies (U.S. FDA\u202f/\u202fFSIS) require that any detection of *Listeria* in a ready\u2011to\u2011eat dairy product (or its environment) be reported within 24\u202fh and that the implicated product be removed from the market.\n\n---\n\n### How often do processors run pathogen\u2011specific PCR (or equivalent) checks?\n\n| Test type | Typical frequency in a large\u2011scale pasteurised\u2011milk plant (U.S./EU) | Reason for that cadence |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)** \u2013 on\u2011line, per **batch** (every 30\u201160\u202fmin for HTST lines) | **Every batch** (the test is automated and results are logged in real time). | Guarantees each batch received the correct heat dose; a single \u201cfail\u201d stops the line. |\n| **Total aerobic plate count (APC) & coliforms** \u2013 culture plates | **1\u20132\u202ftimes per shift** (e.g., every 4\u20138\u202fh) for each production line. | Detects overall hygiene and any post\u2011process bacterial growth. |\n| **Listeria spp. (PCR or rapid enrichment)** \u2013 environmental swabs & product | **Daily** environmental swabs; **weekly** product\u2011batch PCR (or every 2\u20133\u202fdays for smaller plants). | *Listeria* is the most serious post\u2011process contaminant; daily swabs are a HACCP requirement in many jurisdictions (e.g., USDA\u202fFSIS Directive\u202f7120.1). |\n| **Salmonella spp., STEC (E.\u202fcoli O157:H7 & other Shiga\u2011toxin producers)** \u2013 PCR/enrichment | **Weekly** product testing (usually a composite of 5\u201310\u202fL from each lot). Some plants run **bi\u2011weekly** if they have a spotless record and a validated cleaning program. | These pathogens are rarer in milk but have high outbreak potential; weekly testing balances cost and safety. |\n| **Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin** \u2013 ELISA or PCR | **Per lot** for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d runs (e.g., when bulk tank somatic cell count spikes) or **monthly** as part of the routine schedule. | Detects toxin that can survive pasteurisation if produced before heating. |\n| **Campylobacter spp.** \u2013 PCR (rarely required) | **Monthly** or **on\u2011",
