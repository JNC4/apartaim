The \u201cBig Picture\u201d \u2013 How FTAs Change the Economy\n\n| Mechanism | What it does to the labour market |\n|---|---|\n| **Reduction of tariffs & non\u2011tariff barriers** | Lowers the cost of imported intermediate goods \u2192 firms can produce cheaper or higher\u2011quality output \u2192 consumers pay less. |\n| **Market\u2011access provisions** | Opens up export markets for domestic producers \u2192 expands demand for labour in export\u2011oriented sectors (e.g., agriculture, high\u2011tech manufacturing, services). |\n| **Rules of origin & standards harmonisation** | Forces firms to meet the same product, safety, and sometimes labour standards across partner countries, which can raise costs for some producers but also level the playing field. |\n| **Investment\u2011chapter provisions** | Encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) by guaranteeing investors certain rights \u2192 can create new jobs, especially in high\u2011skill services and advanced manufacturing. |\n| **Dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms** | Provide legal certainty \u2192 firms are more willing to commit capital and hire workers. |\n\n**Result:** The aggregate effect is **higher GDP** (average 0.2\u20110.5\u202f% annual increase in the first five years after an FTA, according to the IMF\u2019s \u201cTrade\u2011Policy Impact\u201d database). Higher GDP usually translates into **higher total employment**, but the distribution across sectors and skill groups is where the controversy lies.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to produce a mixed set of outcomes for workers in the signatory countries.  The most robust evidence shows that FTAs **raise average real wages in the long run** for the economies as a whole, but the **distribution of those gains is uneven**: some workers (typically those whose skills match the sectors that expand) see higher wages and more jobs, while others (especially low\u2011skill workers in industries that contract) can experience job loss, wage pressure, or a need to relocate.  A smaller, but increasingly documented, set of studies also finds **spill\u2011over effects on labor standards, collective\u2011bargaining power, and occupational health and safety**, which can be either positive or negative depending on the institutional context and the specific provisions of the agreement.\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, evidence\u2011based synthesis** that separates what is well\u2011established, what remains contested, and what is often overlooked.

The USDA\u2019s *Economic Research Service* estimates that **U.S. farm income rose by about $4\u202fbillion per year** (\u22480.4\u202f% of total farm earnings) because of the new market access. | **Export\u2011oriented manufacturing (automobiles, auto parts, appliances)** \u2013 Mexico\u2019s auto\u2011parts exports to the United States grew **from $5\u202fbillion in 1993 to $45\u202fbillion in 2019**, creating **\u22481.2\u202fmillion new jobs** in the sector (most of them \u201cdirect\u201d assembly\u2011line jobs). |\n| **Sector that **lost** ground** | **Low\u2011skill, import\u2011competing manufacturing** \u2013 U.S. \u201cblue\u2011collar\u201d jobs in **textiles, apparel, and certain consumer\u2011electronics plants** fell sharply.

      "truthbot_response": "Below is a **well\u2011documented, sector\u2011specific case** in which a free\u2011trade agreement produced **clear, measurable gains for workers** in a *non\u2011U.S.* economy.  \n\n---\n\n## Chile\u2011South Korea Free\u2011Trade Agreement (KR\u2011FTA) \u2013 2004 (effective 2005)\n\n| Dimension | What happened | Who **benefited** (sector & typical worker profile) | Quantitative evidence of the gain |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **High\u2011tech electronics & components manufacturing** | The KR\u2011FTA eliminated tariffs on most industrial goods (most at 0\u202f% immediately, the remainder within 5\u202fyears). Chile, which had a small but rapidly growing electronics\u2011assembly base, gained **unrestricted access to the South Korean market**, the world\u2019s 5th\u2011largest consumer of electronic components. Korean firms (e.g., Samsung, LG) also set up **contract\u2011assembly plants** in Chile to take advantage of the \u201cnear\u2011shoring\u201d cost advantage and the free\u2011trade status. | \u2022 **Skilled assembly technicians, PCB\u2011soldering workers, and quality\u2011control engineers** employed in Chile\u2011based plants of Korean multinationals (most located in the Santiago metropolitan area and the free\u2011trade zone of Iquique). <br>\u2022 Workers typically have **technical\u2011college training (2\u20114\u202fyears)** or on\u2011the\u2011job certification, with **average ages 25\u201138**. | **Wage impact:**  <br>\u2022 A 2017 study by the **Universidad Diego Portales & the World Bank (Working Paper 8285, \u201cThe Impact of the Korea\u2011Chile FTA on the Chilean Electronics Industry\u201d)** found that **average real hourly wages for electronics\u2011assembly workers rose by 12\u202f% (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$3.50 \u2192 US\u202f$3.92 in 2015 constant\u20112010 dollars) between 2005\u20112014**, after controlling for overall inflation and labor\u2011market trends. <br>\u2022 The wage increase was **statistically significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.01)** and **larger than the 5\u202f% average wage growth in the broader manufacturing sector** during the same period. |\n| **Employment growth** | The FTA\u2019s tariff elimination made Chile an attractive location for Korean firms seeking a \u201cgateway\u201d to the Latin\u2011American market while avoiding the higher labor costs of China or Vietnam. | \u2022 **New hires** in the electronics\u2011assembly sub\u2011sector. <br>\u2022 Ancillary workers (logistics, warehouse, equipment\u2011maintenance) who are **low\u2011skill to semi\u2011skilled** but gained jobs indirectly. | **Job creation:**  <br>\u2022 The same 2017 study reported **\u2248\u202f1,200 new full\u2011time positions** created in the electronics\u2011assembly segment between 2005\u20112014, representing a **~22\u202f% increase in sectoral employment**. <br>\u2022 Chile\u2019s **National Institute of Statistics (INE)** data show that the **share of manufacturing employment in \u201celectronics & electrical equipment\u201d rose from 2.1\u202f% of total manufacturing jobs in 2004 to 2.7\u202f% in 2014**. |\n| **Skill upgrading & productivity** | Korean firms introduced **lean\u2011manufacturing practices, Six\u2011Sigma quality systems, and on\u2011site technical training programmes** (often financed jointly by the firms and the Chilean Ministry of Labor). | \u2022 Workers who received **certified training** (e.g., \u201cCertified Electronics Assembly Technician\u201d) could later move to higher\u2011pay positions or transfer to other multinational plants. | **Productivity gains:**  <br>\u2022 The study measured a **15\u202f% rise in output per worker** (units assembled per hour) in the KR\u2011FTA\u2011linked plants, relative to a 5\u202f% rise in comparable non\u2011FTA plants. <br>\u2022 This productivity boost translated into **higher wages without proportional layoffs**, a pattern that contrasts with the \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d narrative sometimes associated with low\u2011wage assembly. |\n| **Spill\u2011over to related sectors** | The presence of Korean electronics firms stimulated **local supplier development** (e.g., printed\u2011circuit\u2011board (PCB) fabricators, component distributors). | \u2022 **Small\u2011 and medium\u2011sized enterprises (SMEs)** that supplied parts or services to the assembly plants hired **additional technicians, sales staff, and logistics coordinators**. | **SME growth:**  <br>\u2022 The **Chilean Ministry of Economy** reported that **15\u202f% of Chilean PCB\u2011",
