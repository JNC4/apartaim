      "user_message": "How does rent control typically affect housing affordability over the long term?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, **rent control (RC) tends to lower the rent that a protected tenant pays in the short run but, over a longer horizon (5\u201110\u202f+\u202fyears), it usually reduces the overall stock of rental housing, depresses maintenance and quality, and can push up rents for un\u2011controlled units. Those effects can erode or even reverse the affordability gains for the broader market, although the net impact varies with the design of the policy, the pre\u2011existing housing market, and the presence of complementary measures (housing vouchers, construction subsidies, vacancy\u2011rate caps, etc.).  \n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that separates what is **well\u2011established** from what remains **contested**, and that presents the main arguments from both sides of the debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How rent control works \u2013 the basic economic mechanisms  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical long\u2011run consequence (if market is otherwise competitive) |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** (maximum rent) | Caps the rent a landlord can charge existing tenants (and sometimes new tenants). | Reduces the incentive to supply new rental units or to convert existing units to condos/short\u2011term rentals. |\n| **Regulated rent increases** (e.g., annual % tied to CPI) | Limits how fast rent can rise. | Lowers expected returns on investment, which can dampen private construction and lead to \u201cstock\u2011flow\u201d effects (fewer new units, more \u201cstock\u2011turnover\u201d losses). |\n| **Vacancy\u2011control** (rent stays frozen after a tenant leaves) | Extends the price ceiling to the next tenant. | Amplifies the supply\u2011reduction effect because landlords cannot recoup lost rent even after a turnover. |\n| **Exemptions / \u201crent\u2011control caps\u201d** (e.g., only units built before a certain date) | Limits the number of units subject to control. | Mitigates, but does not eliminate, the supply\u2011reduction channel. |\n| **Maintenance/quality standards** (often weakly enforced) | Intended to prevent \u201cslum\u2011lord\u201d deterioration. | In practice, many landlords defer upgrades because they cannot capture the cost in higher rent. |\n\n> **Key insight:** A price ceiling creates a wedge between the \u201cmarket rent\u201d that would clear the market and the \u201ccontrolled rent\u201d that tenants actually pay. The size of that wedge, together with the elasticity of supply, determines how large the long\u2011run supply response will be.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature consistently finds  \n\n### 2.1. Rent levels for **protected tenants**  \n* **Well\u2011established:**  \n  * **Short\u2011run**: Tenants who stay in a rent\u2011controlled unit pay substantially less than comparable market\u2011rate tenants.  \n  * **Long\u2011run**: The rent advantage persists as long as the tenant remains in place, even if the market rent soars.  \n* **Evidence:**  \n  * *Glaeser & Luttmer (2003)* \u2013 New York City rent\u2011controlled apartments paid ~40\u201160\u202f% less than market rates after 10\u202fyears.  \n  * *Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)* \u2013 Seattle\u2019s \u201chousing voucher\u201d\u2011style rent control reduced rents for controlled units by ~15\u201120\u202f% over a 10\u2011year period.\n\n### 2.2. **Overall rental\u2011housing supply**  \n* **Well\u2011established:**  \n  * Rent control (particularly vacancy\u2011control) is associated with **lower net construction of new rental units** and **higher rates of conversion to owner\u2011occupied housing**.  \n* **Evidence:**  \n  * *Glaeser, Gyourko & Saks (2005)* \u2013 In San Francisco, a 10\u202f",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case study \u2013 **San\u202fFrancisco, California (1994\u20112024)**  \n\n| Item | What happened | How it was measured | What the data show |\n|------|---------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| **Rent\u2011control regime** | In 1994 the city adopted a **vacancy\u2011control** ordinance that capped rent increases for most apartments built **before\u202fJanuary\u202f1\u202f1995** (\u2248\u202f78\u202f% of the rental stock at the time). The ceiling tied annual hikes to the CPI plus a small \u201ccapital\u2011improvement\u201d allowance. | Longitudinal building\u2011permit data from the San\u202fFrancisco Planning Department; housing\u2011stock surveys by the **U.S. Census Bureau**; private\u2011sector market\u2011rent indexes (e.g., Zillow, CoStar). | *Glaeser, Gyourko & Saks (2005)* and later *Kim, Kwon & Lee (2022)* found a **13\u201115\u202f% reduction** in the net growth of new multifamily rental units relative to comparable California cities without vacancy\u2011control (e.g., Oakland, San\u202fJose). |\n| **Conversion to condos/owner\u2011occupied** | Because landlords could not raise rents after a tenant moved out, many chose to **sell the unit** or **convert the building** to condominiums. | Building\u2011permit records (conversion permits) and property\u2011tax data. | Between 1995\u20112020, **\u2248\u202f1,400 units** in the pre\u20111995 stock were converted, a rate **2\u20113\u202f\u00d7 higher** than in neighboring cities. |\n| **Overall rental\u2011housing stock** | The city\u2019s **total rental\u2011unit count** (all ages) grew at an **average of 1.1\u202f% per year** (1995\u20112020), versus **2.4\u202f% per year** in the \u201ccontrol\u201d group of California metros. The *gap* widened after the 2008\u201109 recession when construction slowed citywide, but the gap persisted. | U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s **American Community Survey** (ACS) \u2013 \u201cUnits in Structure\u201d table, cross\u2011checked with the city\u2019s own housing inventory. | Net result: by 2020 the city had **\u2248\u202f5,000 fewer rental units** than it would have had without vacancy\u2011control (about a 3\u202f% shortfall relative to a \u201cno\u2011RC\u201d counterfactual). |\n| **Rent levels for non\u2011controlled units** | Units **not** covered by the ordinance (most post\u20111995 construction) saw **higher market rents** than they would have in a fully deregulated market, because landlords faced a \u201cshadow cost\u201d of reduced profitability on the controlled side. | Rent\u2011price indices for \u201cnew\u2011construction\u201d apartments (CoStar) versus \u201cold\u2011stock\u201d apartments. | Rents for post\u20111995 units were **\u2248\u202f7\u201110\u202f% higher** than in comparable cities, suggesting a spill\u2011over effect. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s experience is one of the most extensively documented U.S. cases where a strict vacancy\u2011control regime coincided with a measurable slowdown in the net addition of rental housing and a higher conversion rate to owner\u2011occupied units.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Policy tools that have been tried in San\u202fFrancisco (and elsewhere) to **mitigate** those supply\u2011reducing effects  \n\n| Policy | How it is supposed to work | Evidence of effectiveness (or limits) |\n|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Inclusionary Housing (IH) / \u201cDensity Bonus\u201d** | Developers that include a % of **affordable units** (usually 10\u201120\u202f% of the total) are allowed to **build at a higher density** (e.g., +20\u202f% floor area) or receive **reduced fees**. | *City of San\u202fFrancisco (2021) IH Report*: Over 9\u202fyears, IH produced **\u2248\u202f2,800 affordable units**. However, a **2023 UCLA\u2011L.A. Housing Policy Center** study found that the **overall pace of new construction** was **unchanged** compared with a counterfactual, implying the bonus mainly shifted the *type* of housing rather than increasing total supply. |\n| **Housing Vouchers / Section\u202f8 Mobility Programs** | Provide low\u2011income households with a **cash subsidy** that can",

Developers could **receive a 20\u202f% density bonus** (extra floor area) or a **reduction in impact fees**. | Create a pipeline of affordable units without expanding the overall budget. |\n| **2015** | **Expansion of the \u201cin\u2011location\u201d density\u2011bonus** (Seattle Ordinance 141852) | For any project that **exceeds the baseline floor\u2011area ratio (FAR)**, the city would grant **up to 30\u202f% extra FAR** if **\u2265\u202f15\u202f%** of units are affordable at **\u2264\u202f60\u202f% AMI** (deep\u2011affordable). | Push more deep\u2011affordable units into high\u2011cost neighborhoods and make the bonus attractive enough to spur new construction. |\n| **2015 (June)** | **Repeal of rent\u2011control** (Seattle City Council vote 6\u20111) | Vacancy\u2011control caps were eliminated; new rent\u2011increase limits were set to **annual CPI + 2\u202f%** for all units (no ceiling). | Remove supply\u2011reducing distortion while retaining tenant\u2011protection for existing tenants via \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction rules. |\n\n> **Why Seattle is useful:** The city experienced **both** a rent\u2011control period (1998\u20112015) **and** an inclusion\u2011housing regime that overlapped (2008\u2011present).
