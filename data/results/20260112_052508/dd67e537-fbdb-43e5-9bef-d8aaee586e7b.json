The study is frequently quoted in the scholarly debate because it uses a *before\u2011and\u2011after* (pre\u2011post) design, controls for national homicide trends, and applies a time\u2011series statistical model that is standard in policy\u2011evaluation work.\n\n---\n\n## 1.\u202fStudy at a glance  \n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Citation** | **Kelley, D. & Welch, M.
