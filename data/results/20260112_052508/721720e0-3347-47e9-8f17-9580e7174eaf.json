      "unknown_model_response": "**How economists try to tell whether sanctions \u201cwork\u201d**\n\nEconomists treat a sanction\u2019s success as a **causal question**: *Did the sanction cause a change in the target\u2019s behavior that the sanctioner wanted?*  \nBecause sanctions are rarely the only thing happening at the same time, scholars have developed a toolbox of quantitative and qualitative methods to construct a plausible counter\u2011factual (what would have happened without the sanction) and then compare it to the observed outcome. Below are the main approaches that appear in the literature, together with the kinds of outcome variables they usually track, the data sources they rely on, and their chief strengths and limitations.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The timing of the 1990 release of Nelson\u202fMandela coincided with the deepest export slump. | \u2022 The sanction announcement (July\u202f1986) is a clear \u201cevent\u201d date.  <br>\u2022 Researchers (e.g., **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott 2007**, Chapter\u202f5) control for global commodity\u2011price movements by using the *world price index for the same commodities* as a covariate, reducing the risk that a fall in oil prices alone explains the decline.  <br>\u2022 Parallel\u2011trend checks show that South\u2011African exports were tracking the rest of the \u201cmining\u2011export\u201d group (Botswana, Zambia) up to 1986, then diverged.  <br>\u2022 Critics (e.g., **Sullivan 2014**) argue that internal political dynamics\u2014mass protests, the 1989 \u201cstate of emergency\u201d and the collapse of the Soviet Union\u2014were equally important, so the sanction *alone* cannot be claimed as the sole driver. |\n| **B. \u202fEU & U.S. sanctions on Russia after Crimea (2014\u2011present)** | Compel Russia to reverse its annexation of Crimea and to cease support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. | **Difference\u2011in\u2011Differences (DiD)** comparing Russia (treated) to a matched set of \u201cnon\u2011sanctioned\u201d post\u2011Soviet economies (e.g., Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine\u2011pre\u20112014, and the Baltic states with a synthetic\u2011control weighting). | The DiD estimate for **real GDP growth** in the first two years after the sanctions is **\u20110.8\u202fpp** (statistically significant at the 5\u202f% level).  <br>For **foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) inflows**, the treatment effect is **\u201145\u202f%** relative to the control group.  <br>However, a separate DiD on *militarized conflict intensity* (number of cease\u2011fire violations) finds **no statistically significant reduction**; the conflict continued at the pre\u2011sanction level. | \u2022 The treatment year (mid\u20112014) is unambiguous, and the control pool is built using **propensity\u2011score matching** on pre\u20112014 trends in GDP, trade openness, and oil\u2011price exposure (see **Kleinberg, 2021;** **Miller & Hurd, 2022**).  <br>\u2022 Robustness checks: (i) dropping each control country one\u2011by\u2011one; (ii) using a synthetic\u2011control version that reproduces the exact pre\u2011sanction path of Russia\u2019s GDP; (iii) adding oil\u2011price shocks as a covariate.  <br>\u2022 Limitations: (i) **spillovers**\u2014the sanctions also hit the control economies (e.g., Belarus) via reduced EU trade, biasing the estimate toward zero; (ii) **policy endogeneity**\u2014the sanctions were accompanied by a sharp fall in oil prices in 2014, which independently depressed Russian output.  <br>\u2022 The mixed result (economic costs but no clear behavioral change) is why many scholars label the 2014 sanctions as **\u201cpartially effective\u201d**: they hurt the target\u2019s economy but did not achieve the primary political objective. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.
