      "unknown_model_response": "**1. Why sanctions are used \u2013 the logic behind them**\n\n| Intended pathway | What it means in practice | Typical tools |\n|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| **Economic coercion** | Reduce the target\u2019s welfare (GDP, government revenue, access to finance or key imports) so that the cost of the \u201cbad\u201d behaviour outweighs any perceived benefit. | Trade bans, asset freezes, financial\u2011market exclusions, oil\u2011price caps, secondary sanctions on firms that do business with the target. |\n| **Political signaling / reputational pressure** | Show the international community that a certain action is unacceptable, thereby isolating the target diplomatically and making it harder for the regime to claim legitimacy at home or abroad. | Diplomatic expulsions, public naming\u2011and\u2011shaming, UN\u2011mandated embargoes. |\n| **Domestic pressure on elites** | By freezing or seizing assets of senior officials, restricting their ability to travel or conduct business, sanctions aim to create a \u201cpain\u2011point\u201d inside the ruling coalition that can be leveraged for policy change. | Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions on individuals, companies, and sectors (e.g., arms embargoes, prohibitions on luxury goods). |\n| **Deterrence / normative diffusion** | Create a precedent that discourages other states from taking the same action, spreading the cost of non\u2011compliance beyond the immediate target. | Multilateral UN resolutions, coordinated sanctions regimes (EU\u2011US\u2011UK, etc.). |\n| **Encouraging internal opposition** | By weakening the regime\u2019s resources, sanctions are hoped to give opposition movements more space to organize and push for change. | Human\u2011rights\u2011focused sanctions, funding cuts to state\u2011controlled media, support for civil\u2011society groups (often done alongside, not as part of, the sanction package). |\n\nIn practice, a single sanctions package usually tries to combine several of these pathways.  The \u201csmart\u2011sanctions\u201d paradigm that emerged in the late\u20111990s (e.g., against the former Yugoslavia) explicitly shifted emphasis from broad trade embargoes to elite\u2011targeted measures, hoping to avoid humanitarian fallout while preserving the coercive lever.\n\n---\n\n**2. How scholars measure \u201csuccess\u201d**\n\n| Definition used by researchers | Example of a positive outcome | Caveats |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| **Policy reversal** \u2013 the target stops the specific behavior that triggered the sanctions (e.g., ends a weapons program, withdraws troops). | Iran\u2019s 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) after UN/US/EU sanctions. | Often ambiguous whether the change is permanent or merely a tactical pause. |\n| **Partial compliance** \u2013 the target modifies the behavior enough to meet the sanction\u2011setter\u2019s demands, even if not fully. | South Africa\u2019s dismantling of apartheid laws (sanctions contributed, but internal activism was decisive). | Success may be over\u2011stated if other factors (domestic protests, economic crisis) were more decisive. |\n| **Behavioural signaling** \u2013 the target signals willingness to negotiate, even if concrete concessions are delayed. | North Korea\u2019s 2018\u20112020 \u201csummit\u201d diplomacy after intensified US sanctions. | Signals can be diplomatic posturing; no guarantee of substantive change. |\n| **Failure / backfire** \u2013 sanctions have little effect, or they entrench the target\u2019s resolve, or they cause humanitarian harm. | Cuba (US embargo since 1960) \u2013 regime survived; sanctions have been repeatedly judged as ineffective. | Humanitarian costs are often harder to quantify but are a major part of the \u201cfailure\u201d discussion. |\n\nBecause sanctions are usually implemented alongside diplomatic negotiations, aid packages, or military threats, isolating the causal impact of sanctions alone is methodologically challenging.  Most quantitative studies therefore rely on **event\u2011history (survival) models** that compare the timing of policy changes across many cases while controlling for other variables (e.g., war, regime type, economic ties).\n\n---\n\n**3.

I separate the *intended mechanisms* from the *empirical record*, flag where scholars agree, where they disagree, and where the data are still thin.  Wherever possible I note studies that are often omitted from popular discussions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical \u201clevers\u201d \u2013 why sanctions are expected to change behavior  \n\n| Lever (how sanctions are supposed to work) | Core idea | Typical evidence cited | Main caveats raised by scholars |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Economic pain (coercive leverage)** | Cutting off trade, finance, or investment raises the cost of the target\u2019s policy choice, making the status\u2011quo more expensive than compliance. | \u2013 Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal. (2007) estimate that ~34\u202f% of sanctions achieve their stated objective when they create \u201csignificant economic pressure.\u201d  <br>\u2013 Drezner (2003) argues that the threat of lost market access can be a \u201chidden hand\u201d that forces negotiation. | \u2013 Pain is often borne by ordinary citizens, not the decision\u2011makers (see \u201crally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag\u201d literature). <br>\u2013 The target may absorb the shock through reserves, black\u2011market channels, or substitution (e.g., Iran\u2019s pivot to China). |\n| **Elite\u2011targeting / \u201csmart\u201d sanctions** | By freezing assets, banning travel, or restricting specific sectors (e.g., oil, finance), the sanction aims at the political and economic elites who have the power to change policy. | \u2013 Peksen (2019) finds that targeted sanctions are roughly 2\u20113\u202f\u00d7 more likely to induce a policy shift than comprehensive trade embargoes. <br>\u2013 Early\u2011case work on South Africa (Sullivan 1992) shows that sanctions on the mining sector directly pressured the ruling elite. | \u2013 Elites may be insulated (e.g., through sovereign wealth funds, informal networks). <br>\u2013 Sanctions can entrench elites by giving them a \u201cvictim\u201d narrative that boosts domestic legitimacy. |\n| **Signaling / diplomatic pressure** | Sanctions serve as a visible condemnation that raises the political cost of defiance for the target and signals resolve to allies and rivals. | \u2013 Giumelli (2022) meta\u2011analysis notes that \u201csignaling\u201d improves",

They were designed to hit the regime\u2019s revenue streams and the personal wealth of decision\u2011makers while leaving ordinary Iranians\u2019 access to food, medicine and most consumer goods largely untouched. |\n| **Goal** | Force the Iranian leadership to **curb uranium enrichment** and accept comprehensive verification in return for relief of the financial and oil\u2011trade constraints. | The coercive lever (loss of oil revenue \u2248\u202f$15\u2011$20\u202fbn a year and blocked access to the international financial system) was aimed at making the cost of continuing the nuclear program exceed its perceived security benefit. |\n| **Implementation timeline** | \u2022 **2012\u20112013** \u2013 UN\u2011Security\u2011Council resolutions (1929, 2231) and unilateral US/EU measures begin. <br>\u2022 **June\u202f2013** \u2013 New Iranian president Hassan\u202fR\u2011K (moderate) takes office, signalling openness to talks. <br>\u2022 **Nov\u202f2013\u2011Jan\u202f2014** \u2013 First round of indirect talks in Vienna. <br>\u2022 **July\u202f2015** \u2013 JCPOA signed; sanctions relief begins in early 2016. | The *step\u2011by\u2011step* design (gradual easing of sanctions as Iran met verification milestones) is a hallmark of smart\u2011sanctions: the pressure is reversible, giving the target a clear incentive pathway. |\n| **Outcome** | \u2022 Iran agreed to **limit enrichment to 3.67\u202f%** and cap its stock of low\u2011enriched uranium. <br>\u2022 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) received **unprecedented access** and verified compliance. <br>\u2022 By Jan\u202f2016, **oil\u2011export caps were lifted** and Iranian banks were re\u2011connected to SWIFT. | The *policy reversal* (Iran stopped the most sensitive parts of its nuclear weapons\u2011pathway) matches the most stringent definition of success used in sanctions research. |\n| **Evidence of causal impact** | \u2022 **Economic shock:** Iranian oil\u2011export revenues fell from \u2248\u202f$70\u202fbn (2011) to \u2248\u202f$15\u202fbn (2012\u201113).
