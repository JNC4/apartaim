      "unknown_model_response": "### How Pasteurisation Kills Harmful Bacteria  \n\nPasteurisation is a **controlled heat\u2011treatment** that exploits the fact that most living cells (including bacteria, viruses, and some parasites) are far more fragile than the proteins, fats, sugars, and minerals that give milk its nutritional value.  \nWhen milk is heated to a defined temperature for a defined time, three things happen inside any micro\u2011organism that is present:\n\n| Step | What actually occurs at the molecular level | Why it matters for safety |\n|------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **1. Protein denaturation** | The heat breaks hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges that hold enzymes, structural proteins, and the cell\u2011wall\u2011synthesising machinery in their 3\u2011D shape. | Enzymes that the bacterium needs to grow (e.g., DNA polymerase, ribosomal proteins) become non\u2011functional; the cell can no longer replicate. |\n| **2. Membrane destabilisation** | Phospholipid bilayers become more fluid and eventually leak; heat can cause phase transitions that create pores. | Loss of ion gradients, leakage of cytoplasmic contents, and ultimately rupture of the cell. |\n| **3. Nucleic\u2011acid damage** | At \u2265\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C, the rate of depurination and strand breakage in DNA/RNA rises sharply; heat\u2011induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) also attack nucleic acids. | Even if a cell\u2019s membrane survives, its genetic material is too damaged to direct viable replication. |\n\nThe **combined effect** is that the organism\u2019s \u201creproductive capacity\u201d (its ability to form a colony) is lost, which is what microbiologists count when they say a bacterium is \u201ckilled\u201d.  A cell may still be physically present, but it can no longer cause infection.\n\n---\n\n### Key quantitative concepts used by regulators  \n\n| Term | Definition | Typical value for milk\u2011borne pathogens |\n|------|------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **D\u2011value (Decimal reduction time)** | Time (in minutes or seconds) at a given temperature required to reduce the viable population by **90\u202f%** (1 log). | For *Coxiella burnetii* at 63\u202f\u00b0C \u2192 **D\u2086\u2083 \u2248 2.8\u202fmin** (the most heat\u2011resistant pathogen in milk). |\n| **Z\u2011value** | Temperature increase needed to reduce the D\u2011value by ten\u2011fold. | For most milk bacteria Z \u2248 **5\u202f\u00b0C**. |\n| **Log\u2011reduction** | Number of 10\u2011fold (log) decreases achieved. | Pasteurisation standards require **\u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction** of *C. burnetii* \u2192 \u2264\u202f0.001\u202f% of the original cells survive. |\n\n**Why 5\u2011log?**  \nIf you start with a worst\u2011case contamination of 10\u2074\u202fCFU (colony\u2011forming units) of *C. burnetii* per litre\u2014a level that is considered \u201chighly unlikely but not impossible\u201d in raw milk\u2014 a 5\u2011log reduction leaves you with **1\u202fCFU** per litre.  That single bacterium is far below the infectious dose for humans (the dose\u2011response curve for *C. burnetii* shows that **\u2248\u202f10\u201320 organisms** are needed to cause illness in a healthy adult).  Thus the process provides a **large safety margin**.\n\n---\n\n### A concrete example: *Coxiella burnetii* (the \u201cQ\u2011fever\u201d bacterium)\n\n| Feature | Raw\u2011milk context | What pasteurisation does |\n|---------|------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Why it matters** | *C. burnetii* is the most heat\u2011resistant non\u2011spore\u2011forming pathogen that can be present in milk. It can cause Q\u2011fever, a flu\u2011like illness that can become chronic (endocarditis) especially in people with heart\u2011valve problems. | The **5\u2011log reduction** requirement for pasteurisation is **based on *C. burnetii***.

Because most outbreaks are triggered by far fewer than 10\u2075 cells (often <\u202f10\u00b2), a 5\u2011log reduction drives the risk to a level that is statistically **negligible** for the general population.\n\n### 2.
