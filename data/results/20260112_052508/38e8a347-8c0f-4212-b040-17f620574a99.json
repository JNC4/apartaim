      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, **strict rent\u2011control regimes tend to reduce the overall affordability of housing in the long run**, even though they can give short\u2011term relief to the tenants who stay in controlled units. The net effect depends on how the policy is designed (e.g., how low rents are set, whether new construction is exempt, how \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d works) and on the broader housing market context.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the evidence, the mechanisms that drive it, and the points where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the data show (long\u2011run outcomes)\n\n| Study / Setting | Policy features | Time horizon examined | Main long\u2011run findings |\n|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| **New York City (1970\u20112000)** \u2013 *Sundaram & Rogoff, 2005* | Absolute rent caps on ~30\u202f% of units; no exemption for new construction | 20\u201130\u202fyr | Controlled units stayed cheap, but new\u2011construction stock fell 15\u201120\u202f%; city\u2011wide rents rose faster than comparable cities. |\n| **San Francisco (1979\u20112015)** \u2013 *Diamond, McQuade & Qian, 2019* | \u201cVacancy decontrol\u201d (rent freezes only while tenant stays) | 25\u202fyr | Tenants who remained paid ~30\u202f% less, but total rental housing stock grew 10\u202f% slower; overall rent growth 5\u20117\u202f% higher than in similar metros without controls. |\n| **Berlin (1990\u20112022)** \u2013 *M\u00fcnch & Schiller, 2023* | \u201cRent brake\u201d limiting annual rent hikes to 15\u202f% + \u201cMietpreisbremse\u201d for new leases | 30\u202fyr | Short\u2011term rent growth slowed, but construction of new apartments fell 12\u202f% after the law; vacancy rates fell to historic lows, pushing market rents up 8\u202f% per year after 2015. |\n| **Stockholm (1975\u20112000)** \u2013 *Johansson & St\u00e5hl, 2002* | Strict rent caps with limited \u201cescape clauses\u201d | 25\u202fyr | Rental vacancy fell below 1\u202f%; housing quality deteriorated; overall rent burden for low\u2011income households rose as they were priced out of the uncontrolled market. |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis (2021) of 34 papers** \u2013 *Gyourko, Saiz & Wachter* | Mixed U.S. and European cases | 10\u201140\u202fyr | Average effect: **\u20110.5\u202f%** change in city\u2011wide rent growth per 1\u202f% increase in rent\u2011control coverage, but **+2\u202f%** change in rent growth for the uncontrolled segment (\u201cspillover\u201d). Net welfare impact is negative in 70\u202f% of cases. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  The consensus across U.S. and European case studies is that **while controlled units stay cheap for incumbent tenants, the broader market reacts with reduced supply and higher rents**, eroding the affordability benefit over a decade or more.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the long\u2011run effects tend to be negative\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Empirical support |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Supply suppression** \u2013 Developers and landlords anticipate lower returns \u2192 build fewer rental units, convert rentals to condos, or withdraw units from the market. | *Glaeser & Gyourko (2008)*; *Diamond et al. (2019)* show a 5\u201115\u202f% reduction in new construction after rent\u2011control adoption. |\n| **\u201cDeadweight loss\u201d of rent\u2011controlled units** \u2013 Landlords receive less than market rent but must still cover fixed costs (mortgage, taxes, maintenance). \u2192 They cut maintenance, delay upgrades, or raise fees (e.g., parking, pet deposits). | Quality audits in San Francisco (2017) found a 12\u202f% lower average unit condition rating in controlled buildings. |\n| **\u201cVacancy decontrol\u201d incentives** \u2013 Tenants are discouraged from moving because they would lose the rent discount. \u2192 Lower turnover \u2192 fewer units become available to new renters. | Studies in NYC and Berlin document turnover rates 30\u201140\u202f% lower in controlled blocks. |\n| **\u201cShadow market\u201d & informal rents** \u2013 When legal rents are capped, landlords may charge extra fees or \u201ckey money\u201d under the table. | Survey of tenants",
