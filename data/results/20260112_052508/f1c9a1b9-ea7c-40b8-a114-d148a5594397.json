The Core Economic Mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical impact on workers (positive/negative/mixed) |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Tariff & quota removal** | Imported goods become cheaper; domestic firms face stronger competition. | **Positive** \u2013 lower consumer prices, higher real wages for households that spend on those goods. **Negative** \u2013 firms that previously relied on protection may cut output or lay off workers. |\n| **Export\u2011market expansion** | Domestic producers can sell to a larger pool of buyers. | **Positive** \u2013 creates jobs in export\u2011oriented sectors (e.g., manufacturing, services). Often higher\u2011skill, better\u2011paying jobs. |\n| **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)** | Multinationals set up plants, joint ventures, or service centers to serve the new market. | **Positive** \u2013 new jobs, technology spill\u2011overs, sometimes higher safety and labor\u2011standards (especially when multinational corporate policies are strong). **Negative** \u2013 FDI may crowd out small local firms, and the jobs can be low\u2011skill, temporary, or in \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d wage settings if labor laws are weak. |\n| **Supply\u2011chain integration** | Firms re\u2011organise production across borders (e.g., parts made in one country, assembled in another). | **Mixed** \u2013 can raise demand for intermediate\u2011goods workers (often low\u2011skill) while reducing demand for final\u2011assembly workers in the original country. |\n| **Regulatory convergence & \u201cside\u2011agreements\u201d** (e.g., labor chapters) | FTAs sometimes include commitments to enforce minimum labor rights, collective\u2011bargaining, or occupational\u2011health standards. | **Potentially positive** if enforcement is credible; otherwise the clause may be symbolic. |\n| **Mobility of capital & \u201coffshoring\u201d** | Firms shift production to the lowest\u2011cost location. | **Negative** for workers in the original (higher\u2011cost) location if jobs move abroad; **positive** for workers in the receiving location (though wages may be lower than in the origin). |\n| **Adjustment costs & \u201ccreative destruction\u201d** | Workers displaced from shrinking sectors must retrain or move. | **Negative in the short\u2011run** (unemployment, income loss); **positive in the long\u2011run** if workers transition to higher\u2011productivity sectors. The net effect depends on the speed and generosity of safety\u2011net policies (unemployment insurance, training, relocation assistance). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
