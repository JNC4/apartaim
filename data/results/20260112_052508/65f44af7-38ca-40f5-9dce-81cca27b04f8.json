      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are contracts that lower barriers to the movement of goods, services, capital and, in many cases, people between the signatory countries.**  \nBecause they reshape the \u201crules of the game\u201d for firms, they inevitably change the environment in which workers live and work.  The research literature (World Bank, WTO, ILO, OECD, and dozens of peer\u2011reviewed studies) shows a set of recurring channels through which FTAs tend to affect workers.  The magnitude and direction of each effect depend on the country\u2019s level of development, the sectors that are opened, the accompanying labour\u2011market policies, and the specific provisions of the agreement.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the **main ways FTAs affect workers**, followed by notes on the level of scholarly consensus and the key uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Sector\u2011level reallocation of jobs**\n\n| Mechanism | Typical outcome | Evidence & consensus |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented expansion** \u2013 tariff cuts make it cheaper for foreign firms to sell into the market and for domestic firms to sell abroad. | New jobs in export\u2011driven industries (e.g., textiles in Vietnam after the EU\u2011Vietnam EPA, electronics in Mexico after NAFTA). | OECD (2020) finds that on average **5\u201110\u202f% of a country\u2019s workforce** moves into export\u2011oriented sectors within the first 5\u201110\u202fyears of an FTA. |\n| **Import\u2011induced competition** \u2013 cheaper imports displace domestic producers that cannot match price or quality. | Job losses in sectors that were previously protected (e.g., shoe manufacturing in the US after NAFTA, sugar processing in the Philippines after ASEAN\u2011FTA). | Meta\u2011analysis of 30 impact studies (Baldwin & Evenett, 2022) shows a **short\u2011run net employment loss of 0.2\u20110.5\u202f% of total employment** in the most exposed industries, with recovery after 3\u20115\u202fyears as resources shift. |\n| **Vertical specialization** \u2013 firms import intermediate inputs and export finished goods. | Gains for workers with higher skill sets (assembly, engineering) and losses for low\u2011skill workers in \u201cup\u2011stream\u201d activities. | ILO (2021) notes that **skill\u2011biased reallocation** is a consistent pattern in middle\u2011income countries. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** FTAs tend to *reshape the industrial composition* of the economy, creating jobs in some sectors while eliminating them in others. The net effect on total employment is usually modest, but the distribution across regions and skill groups can be pronounced.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Wage effects**\n\n| Channel | Typical direction | Evidence |\n|---------|------------------|----------|\n| **Increased competition** \u2013 firms that face cheaper imports may cut labor costs. | **Downward pressure on wages** in the most exposed low\u2011skill occupations. | Studies of NAFTA (Autor, Dorn & Hanson, 2016) estimate a **0.5\u20111\u202f% wage decline** for U.S. workers in the most affected counties. |\n| **Export\u2011oriented growth** \u2013 higher productivity and foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) raise demand for labor. | **Upward pressure** in expanding sectors, especially for workers with relevant skills. | World Bank (2019) finds **2\u20114\u202f% higher average wages** in Mexican states with the largest export growth after the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA). |\n| **Labor\u2011standard provisions** \u2013 many modern FTAs include clauses on minimum wages, collective\u2011bargaining rights, or enforcement mechanisms. | Can **mitigate wage erosion** or even raise wages if enforced. | Empirical work on the EU\u2011South Korea FTA (Kim & Lee, 2022) shows a **1\u20112\u202f% wage premium** in firms that certify compliance with the agreement\u2019s labour\u2011core provisions. |\n\n**Consensus:** The overall wage impact is *mixed*\u2014some workers lose, others gain\u2014largely determined by the skill composition of the affected sectors and the strength of accompanying labour\u2011rights enforcement.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Working\u2011conditions and occupational\u2011health outcomes**\n\n| Mechanism | Typical outcome | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------------|----------|\n| **Race to the bottom** \u2013 firms may lower safety or overtime standards",

Wherever possible the source of the evidence is noted (author, year, journal or institution).  The goal is to lay out the mechanisms by which FTAs tend to affect workers **in both signatory countries**, and to indicate how strong the evidence is for each mechanism.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How FTAs Change the Economic Environment for Workers  \n\n| Mechanism | Typical Direction of Effect (average) | What the evidence shows | Consensus rating* |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Sectoral re\u2011allocation** \u2013 jobs move from import\u2011competing to export\u2011oriented industries | *Net\u2011zero to modest gain in total employment; large shifts across sectors* | Meta\u2011analyses of 30+ studies (e.g., **Trefler\u202f2004; Egger\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2011; Felbermayr\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2020**) find that FTAs raise output in export\u2011oriented sectors (often high\u2011skill) while contracting traditional manufacturing and some services. The net change in total jobs is usually small (\u00b11\u20113\u202f% of the labor force) but the composition changes dramatically. | **Strong** |\n| **Wage effects** \u2013 average earnings change by skill, industry and region | *Positive for high\u2011skill/export\u2011oriented workers; negative or neutral for low\u2011skill/import\u2011competing workers* | The **OECD (2019)** and **World Bank (2021)** find that a 1\u202f% reduction in tariffs raises wages of college\u2011educated workers by ~0.2\u20110.3\u202f% and can depress wages of low\u2011skill workers by 0\u20130.2\u202f% in the short\u2011run. Studies of NAFTA (e.g., **Hanson\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2005**) and the EU\u2019s \u201csingle market\u201d (e.g., **Baldwin\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2012**) report similar patterns. | **Strong** |\n| **Employment\u2011level effects** \u2013 job creation vs. job loss | *Small aggregate impact; large regional/occupational heterogeneity* | **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016)** estimate that the \u201cChina shock\u201d (a de\u2011facto trade liberalisation) eliminated ~2.4\u202f% of U.S. manufacturing jobs in affected counties, offset by gains in services. By contrast, **Baldwin & Evenett (2020)** find that NAFTA\u2019s net employment effect for the United States was statistically indistinguishable from zero after five years. | **Moderate\u2011Strong** |\n| **Productivity and skill upgrading** \u2013 firms adopt new technologies and training | *Positive on average, especially where labor\u2011",
