The basic logic of sanctions  \n\n| Intended influence | How it is supposed to work | Typical tools used |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Coercion** \u2013 force a change in policy or behavior | By raising the cost of continuing the objectionable action (e.g., loss of export revenue, higher borrowing costs) the target will find the status\u2011quo less attractive than compliance. | Trade bans, asset freezes, financial\u2011market restrictions, secondary sanctions on firms that do business with the target. |\n| **Deterrence** \u2013 discourage future undesirable actions | The threat of future sanctions creates a \u201cprice tag\u201d on certain conduct, making other states or non\u2011state actors think twice before copying it. | Public \u201cred\u2011line\u201d statements, pre\u2011emptive embargoes, \u201cswift\u2011punishment\u201d clauses in agreements. |\n| **Punishment / Moral signaling** \u2013 express condemnation and impose a cost | Even if the target does not change, sanctions signal to the international community that the behavior is unacceptable and impose a symbolic cost. | Broad embargoes, travel bans on elites, denial of participation in international institutions. |\n| **Containment / Isolation** \u2013 limit a regime\u2019s ability to project power | By cutting off access to finance, technology, or markets, sanctions aim to reduce a regime\u2019s capacity to fund military operations or export destabilizing ideas. | Arms embargoes, restrictions on dual\u2011use goods, bans on foreign investment. |\n| **Negotiation leverage** \u2013 create a bargaining chip | Sanctions are used as leverage in diplomatic talks; the prospect of lifting them can be offered as an incentive for concessions. | \u201cLift\u2011if\u2011you\u2011comply\u201d schemes, phased sanction relief tied to verification milestones. |\n\n*Note:* In practice a single sanction regime often mixes several of these objectives.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How success is measured\n\n| Metric | Description | Data challenges |\n|--------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Policy change** \u2013 the specific behavior the sanction sought to stop (e.g., nuclear proliferation, aggression) | Most scholars treat a \u201csuccess\u201d as the attainment of the stated political goal. | Attribution is hard: the target may change for unrelated domestic reasons; partial compliance is ambiguous. |\n| **Regime change or weakening** | Overthrow or softening of a government that is the \u201cculprit.\u201d | Many sanctions are deliberately aimed at behavior, not regime change; success may be incidental. |\n| **Economic impact** | Reduction in GDP, trade volume, or access to finance | Economic pain does not automatically translate into political pressure; humanitarian costs are a separate ethical issue. |\n| **Negotiated settlement** | Signing of a treaty, cease\u2011fire, or agreement that incorporates the sanction\u2019s demands. | Often the result of a bundle of diplomatic tools, not sanctions alone. |\n\nBecause the political goal varies, scholars usually evaluate sanctions *by case* rather than by a single universal statistic.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Estimates from the **U.S. Office of the Special Envoy for Iraq (1992\u20111995)** put illicit revenues at **$5\u20137\u202fbillion per year**. | The regime could still fund the military, security services, and a modest WMD\u2011related research budget, blunting the economic shock. |\n| **UN\u2011wide \u201coil\u2011for\u2011food\u201d (OFFP) programme** (1995\u20112003) | The UN allowed Iraq to sell **~2\u202fmillion barrels of oil per month** in exchange for food, medicine, and limited civilian goods.  The programme was **administered by the UN** but **controlled in practice by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil**. | The OFFP **softened the humanitarian impact** but also gave the regime a **legal, predictable revenue stream** (\u2248\u202f$3\u202fbn/yr) that it could divert to the military and to patronage networks. |\n| **Enforcement gaps and \u201cdual\u2011use\u201d loopholes** | Many Western companies obtained **\u201cdual\u2011use\u201d licences** (e.g., for chemicals that could have civilian or military applications).  The **U.S. Office of the Inspector General (1998)** found **\u2248\u202f$1\u202fbn** of sanction\u2011eligible goods were exported under licences that later turned out to be questionable. | These loopholes allowed Iraq to acquire materials relevant to WMD programs and to keep parts of its industrial base functional. |\n|",
