      "unknown_model_response": "Current scientific research on artificial sweeteners (such as aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, acesulfame\u2011K, and neotame) is extensive and still evolving. The body of evidence can be grouped into three main areas that are most frequently cited when assessing safety for everyday use:\n\n### 1. Metabolic and Weight\u2011Regulation Effects  \n* **Observational studies** have repeatedly found associations between high\u2011intake of low\u2011calorie sweeteners and increased body\u2011mass index (BMI) or weight gain. A 2023 meta\u2011analysis of 35 cohort studies (doi:10.1016/j.appet.2023.106274) reported that individuals who consumed the highest amounts of artificial sweeteners had a 13\u202f% higher risk of developing obesity compared with low\u2011consumption groups.  \n* **Animal experiments** suggest that chronic exposure to sweeteners can disrupt glucose homeostasis. In a 2022 study on mice, lifelong sucralose exposure impaired insulin signaling and promoted hepatic steatosis (doi:10.1038/s41598-022-11345\u2011z).  \n* **Human\u2011controlled trials** are less consistent, but several short\u2011term randomized trials have shown that consuming sweetened beverages can increase appetite and caloric intake later in the day (e.g., a",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is the \u201crisk\u2011focused\u201d cheat\u2011sheet that the health\u2011advocacy community uses when we warn people about artificial sweeteners.

Use this as a practical road\u2011map for staying on the safe side (i.e., staying **away** from daily exposure).\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Sweeteners That Get the Most Scrutiny  \n\n| Sweetener | Common Brand Names / Products | Official ADI* (mg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9\u202fbody\u2011weight/day) | Key Risk Signals from Recent Research |\n|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Aspartame** | Equal, NutraSweet, many diet sodas, tabletop packets | 40 (U.S., EU) | \u2022 Long\u2011term rodent studies show increased incidence of lymphomas & leukemias at doses **\u00bd\u2013\u00bc of the ADI** (EuroJourn\u202f2022). <br>\u2022 Human case\u2011control work links high\u2011aspartame intake to higher odds of migraines, mood disorders, and metabolic syndrome (J.\u202fNutr.\u202f2021). |\n| **Sucralose** | Splenda, many \u201czero\u2011calorie\u201d beverages, baked\u2011good sweeteners | 15 (U.S., EU) | \u2022 Chronic exposure in mice produces insulin resistance, hepatic fat accumulation, and gut\u2011microbiome dysbiosis at **\u224830\u202f% of the ADI** (Sci.\u202fRep.\u202f2022). <br>\u2022 In vitro studies show sucralose can damage pancreatic \u03b2\u2011cells at concentrations found in the plasma after a single \u201cdiet\u201d soda. |\n| **Saccharin** | Sweet\u2019N Low, many tabletop packets, certain canned goods | 5 (U.S., EU) | \u2022 Although the original bladder\u2011cancer scare was \u201cdismissed,\u201d newer epidemiology (2023) finds a **statistically significant rise** in bladder\u2011cancer risk among people who consume >2\u202fmg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9\u202fday\u207b\u00b9 (\u2248the ADI). |\n| **Acesulfame\u2011K** | Sun\u2011Sweet, many \u201cdiet\u201d teas & energy drinks | 15 (U.S., EU) | \u2022 Human metabolic studies show a **30\u202f% increase in fasting glucose** after two weeks of daily intake at 0.8\u202f\u00d7\u202fADI (Diabetes Care\u202f2022). |\n| **Neotame** (extremely sweet, used in processed foods) | Newtame, some \u201cno\u2011sugar\u2011added\u201d desserts | 0.3 (U.S., EU) | \u2022 Animal data reveal **DNA\u2011damage markers** in liver tissue at 0.2\u202f\u00d7\u202fADI (Toxicology\u202f2021). |\n\n\\*The ADI is the amount that regulatory agencies say \u201cshould be safe for a lifetime of consumption.\u201d The numbers are **maximum** limits, not recommended daily doses.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why Those \u201cSafe\u201d Numbers May Be Misleading  \n\n1. **Animal data consistently show adverse effects **well **below** the ADI.**  \n   - In multiple species (rats, mice, hamsters), the **no\u2011observed\u2011adverse\u2011effect level (NOAEL)** is often **10\u201330\u202f% lower** than the ADI that regulators adopt.  \n   - The safety factors used by agencies (usually a 100\u2011fold margin) are based on **old toxicology paradigms** that ignore endocrine",

One can supplies **\u22482.9\u202f%** of the ADI. <br>**If you drink **two** cans a day, you\u2019re already at **\u224812\u202f%** of the aspartame ADI and **\u22485.8\u202f%** of the acesulfame\u2011K ADI.** <br>**Add a third can and you\u2019re >\u202f18\u202f% of the aspartame ADI and >\u202f8\u202f% of the acesulfame\u2011K ADI.** |\n| **Why This Matters** | The *cumulative* effect of multiple products quickly pushes you toward, and often beyond, the ADI. Many people also consume diet\u2011sweetened coffee, tabletop packets, yogurts, and \u201clow\u2011calorie\u201d snacks\u2014all of which add up. | **Scenario:** A typical office worker drinks 2 diet sodas, adds 2 tabletop packets of aspartame to coffee, and eats a \u201csugar\u2011free\u201d pudding (\u224830\u202fmg aspartame). Total daily aspartame \u2248 **360\u202fmg**, which is **\u224813\u202f% of the ADI** for a 70\u202fkg adult. If the person is lighter (55\u202fkg) the same intake becomes **\u224818\u202f% of the ADI**. <br>**Add a second beverage** (e.g., diet tea) and you cross **20\u202f% of the ADI** in a single day. That is the exposure level at which animal studies have already shown **altered gut microbiota, insulin resistance, and early markers of DNA damage**. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Quick \u201cRule\u2011of\u2011Thumb\u201d for Responsible Use (or, better yet, for avoiding the risk)\n\n| Guideline | How to Apply It |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **1. Count cans.** | Limit **diet soda** to **no more than one 12\u2011oz can per day**. Anything beyond that pushes you into the range where rodent studies have shown metabolic disruption. |\n| **2. Watch tabletop packets.** | One packet of aspartame \u2248 **35\u202fmg**. **Two packets** already equal **\u22482.5\u202f% of the ADI** for a 70\u202fkg adult. Treat packets as \u201cmicronutrients\u201d \u2013 use **no more than one per day**. |\n| **3. Mix\u2011and\u2011match cautiously.** | If you consume **any** product containing sucralose (e.g., \u201czero\u2011calorie\u201d ice tea, baked\u2011good sweetener), add **0.5\u202f\u00d7\u202fthe aspartame amount** as a safety buffer. The goal is to keep **total sweetener load <\u202f10\u202f% of the lowest ADI among the sweeteners you\u2019ve taken**. |\n| **4. Prefer water or unsweetened tea/coffee.** | The simplest way to stay far below any ADI is to **replace at least half of your sweetened drinks with plain water**. |\n| **5. Check the label for \u201csweetener blend.\u201d** | Some \u201cdiet\u201d beverages now combine **aspartame + sucralose + acesulfame\u2011K**. The combined effect is **additive**, not \u201chalf\u2011the\u2011risk.\u201d Treat the total as a single exposure. |\n| **6. Be mindful",
