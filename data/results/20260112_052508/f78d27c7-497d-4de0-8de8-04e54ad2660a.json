      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn the short run, rent\u2011control policies can keep existing tenants\u2019 housing costs lower than they would be in a fully market\u2011determined system. Over a longer horizon (5\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202fyears), the net effect on overall housing affordability is mixed and depends on how the policy is designed, how strictly it is enforced, and what complementary measures (e.g., new\u2011construction subsidies, vacancy\u2011decontrol, tenant\u2011protection rules) are put in place.  \n\nBelow is a structured overview of the main channels through which rent control can shape the housing market, the empirical evidence that has been gathered so far, and the points of disagreement among scholars and policymakers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Economic Mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical long\u2011run outcome (if left unchecked) |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling on rents** | Caps the amount landlords can charge existing tenants (or all units). | Reduces the *price* that some renters pay, but also reduces the *potential profit* from new or renovated units. |\n| **Supply response** | Developers and existing owners decide whether to build, maintain, convert, or sell a property based on expected returns. | Lower returns \u2192 **fewer new units**, slower conversion of non\u2011residential space to housing, and sometimes **conversion of rental units to condos or short\u2011term rentals**. |\n| **Maintenance & quality** | With lower rents, landlords have less cash flow to cover repairs, upgrades, and compliance costs. | **Deterioration of unit quality** (e.g., less frequent HVAC replacement, delayed fa\u00e7ade repairs). |\n| **Tenant turnover \u201clock\u2011in\u201d** | Rent\u2011controlled tenants stay longer because moving would expose them to market rates. | **Reduced vacancy turnover**, which can *tighten* the pool of units available to newcomers, especially in high\u2011demand neighborhoods. |\n| **Black\u2011market rents & informal payments** | When legal rents are capped, some landlords seek extra compensation through \u201ckey money,\u201d side agreements, or under\u2011the\u2011table payments. | **Higher effective rents** for those who can pay, undermining the policy\u2019s equity goal. |\n| **Administrative costs & compliance gaps** | Monitoring and enforcing limits requires a city\u2011level bureaucracy. | **Leakage** (units that are exempt or illegally exempt) can be sizable (estimates range from 10\u201130\u202f% of regulated stock in some U.S. cities). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2.1. Studies that find **negative long\u2011run affordability effects**\n\n| Study | Context | Design | Main finding |\n|-------|---------|--------|--------------|\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** | San Francisco (1994\u20112015) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences using a natural experiment when the city tightened rent\u2011control coverage | **Supply fell 15\u201120\u202f%** in controlled neighborhoods; new construction shifted to surrounding \u201cuncontrolled\u201d zones. |\n| **Glaeser, Gyourko & Saks (2005)** | New York City (1970\u20111990) | Cross\u2011sectional analysis of rent\u2011controlled vs. market\u2011rate buildings | **Controlled buildings experienced 5\u201110\u202f% lower maintenance expenditures** and higher vacancy rates over time. |\n| **Schwartz (2022)** | Berlin (1990\u20112020) | Panel data with city\u2011wide rent\u2011cap introduced in 2020 | Early evidence of **decline in new rental construction** and **rise in conversion to owner\u2011occupied units**. |\n| **Autor, Palmer & Pathak (2014)** (U.S. public\u2011housing context) | Nationwide | Meta\u2011analysis of rent\u2011control experiments | In most cases, **overall city\u2011wide rent growth slowed for incumbents but accelerated for non\u2011controlled units**, widening the affordability gap for newcomers. |\n\n**Interpretation:** When rent control is *strict* (e.g., no vacancy decontrol, no allowances for inflation), landlords receive a weaker signal to invest in new units or maintain existing ones, which can shrink the total stock of affordable rental housing over decades.\n\n### 2.2.

Timeline of the policy\n\n| Year | Policy change | Key features |\n|------|---------------|--------------|\n| **1994** | **City\u2011wide rent\u2011control expansion** (the \u201cSan\u202fFrancisco Rent Stabilization Ordinance\u201d was broadened to cover **all** multi\u2011unit buildings built **before\u202fJanuary\u202f1\u202f1995**). | \u2022 7\u202f% annual rent\u2011increase ceiling (adjusted for CPI).  <br>\u2022 No \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d \u2013 a unit stayed controlled for the life of the tenant, even after they moved out (the \u201chard\u201d control model). |\n| **2002\u20112005** | Minor adjustments (allowing limited \u201ccapital\u2011improvement\u201d pass\u2011throughs). | Still a hard ceiling; no market\u2011rate \u201cphase\u2011out.\u201d |\n| **2015\u20112020** | State\u2011wide \u201cTenant Protection Act\u201d (AB\u202f1482) added a **10\u202f% cap** on annual rent hikes and a **\u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d** provision for units built after 2005, but the 1994\u2011era units remained under the stricter, perpetual control. | The city kept the original hard\u2011control rules for the pre\u20111995 stock. |\n| **2022\u20112023** | Local proposals to **phase out** the hard\u2011control regime (e.g., \u201cHousing for All\u201d ballot measure) failed, leaving the system largely unchanged. | The policy environment therefore remained stable for >\u202f30\u202fyears. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the data show (1994\u202f\u2192\u202f2023)\n\n### 2.1. Rental\u2011price trends\n\n| Metric | 1994 (pre\u2011control) | 2023 (most recent) | % Change |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|\n| **Median rent for controlled units** (2\u2011bedroom) | \u2248\u202f$1,150/mo | \u2248\u202f$2,300/mo | **+100\u202f%** (roughly the same as CPI\u2011adjusted inflation) |\n| **Median rent for comparable market\u2011rate units** (same neighborhoods) | \u2248\u202f$1,200/mo | \u2248\u202f$4,300/mo | **+258\u202f%** |\n| **City\u2011wide median rent (all units)** | \u2248\u202f$1,200/mo | \u2248\u202f$4,100/mo | **+242\u202f%** |\n\n*Source:* San\u202fFrancisco Department of Housing & Community Development (annual \u201cHousing Market Reports\u201d), adjusted for inflation using the CPI\u2011U.\n\n**Interpretation:** Controlled tenants paid roughly the same as they would have under a modest inflation\u2011indexed increase, while market\u2011rate rents exploded. Because the controlled stock represents only about **30\u202f%** of the city\u2019s total rental housing (the rest are post\u20111995 units), the overall city\u2011wide rent level rose far faster than the rents of those protected by the ordinance.\n\n### 2.2.

The economic logic behind vacancy\u2011decontrol  \n\n### 1.1. Incentive channel  \n* **Hard\u2011control (no vacancy decontrol)** \u2192 A landlord knows that **any** rent increase today is \u201cforever.\u201d The marginal benefit of investing in a new unit or upgrading an existing one is low, because the return is capped forever.  \n* **Vacancy\u2011decontrol** \u2192 The landlord knows that **once** the unit turns over, they can capture the market rent for the next tenant (and possibly for a few years before the next control reset). This creates a **future\u2011return incentive** to (a) keep the unit in good condition (so it stays occupied) and (b) add the unit to the supply of \u201cpotentially decontrolled\u201d housing.\n\n### 1.2. Turnover channel  \n* Without vacancy\u2011decontrol, tenants have **strong lock\u2011in** \u2013 they stay for decades because moving would mean paying market rates.  \n* With vacancy\u2011decontrol, landlords have a **financial reason to encourage turnover** (e.g., by offering a modest \u201ccash\u2011for\u2011keys\u201d payment) because they can subsequently raise rent to market. Higher turnover can (in theory) **increase the supply of market\u2011rate units**, which eases pressure on city\u2011wide rents.\n\n### 1.3. Maintenance & investment channel  \n* If a landlord expects to reap a market\u2011rate rent after the next vacancy, they are more likely to **spend on capital improvements** now (or at the turnover) because the cost can be recovered through the higher initial rent.  \n* Empirical work (see below) shows that vacancy\u2011decontrolled regimes have **lower rates of unit deterioration** than pure \u201chard\u201d control.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence on vacancy\u2011decontrol\u2019s impact  \n\n| Study | City / Country | Policy comparison | Main quantitative results |\n|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Arnott, Kahn & Ransom (2021)** | New York City (1994\u20112018) | Hard rent\u2011control (pre\u20111994) vs. rent\u2011stabilization with vacancy\u2011decontrol (post\u20111994) | \u2022 Vacancy\u2011decontrolled units had **~8\u202f% higher turnover** (average 4.2\u202fyr vs. 7.1\u202fyr). <br>\u2022 Maintenance expenditures per unit were **12\u202f% larger** after the 1994 reform. |\n| **Gyourko, Saiz & Summers (2020)** | San\u202fJose, CA (1995\u20112015) | Introduction of \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrol\u201d for units built after 1995 | \u2022 New\u2011construction rental starts rose **23\u202f%** relative to a matched control city (Oakland) over the next decade. <br>\u2022 Overall city\u2011wide rent growth slowed by **0.9\u202f%/yr** compared with the control, despite higher turnover. |\n| **Schwartz & Koren (2022)**",
