      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of peer\u2011reviewed research and the statements of the world\u2019s major scientific and regulatory bodies conclude that **the genetically engineered (GE) foods that have completed a full safety assessment and are currently on the market are as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts**.  This conclusion is based on dozens of animal\u2011feeding trials, compositional analyses, and, where available, human dietary studies.  At the same time, a smaller number of studies raise questions about specific traits, long\u2011term exposure, or methodological quality; these studies are widely regarded as either inconclusive or limited by design flaws.  Consequently, the scientific community calls for **case\u2011by\u2011case risk assessment, transparent post\u2011market monitoring, and continued independent research**, especially for new traits and for stacked/CRISPR\u2011edited crops.\n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that separates what is **well\u2011established** from what remains **debated or uncertain**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The scientific consensus (well\u2011established)\n\n| Organization / Report | Main conclusion on food safety | Key points |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------|------------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** \u2013 \u201cFood, Genetically Modified\u201d (2022) | No evidence that currently approved GM foods pose a higher risk to human health than conventional foods. | Emphasises case\u2011by\u2011case assessment; recommends long\u2011term monitoring. |\n| **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) & WHO \u2013 Joint Expert Consultation (2019)** | GM foods on the market are safe for consumption. | Based on >1,000 peer\u2011reviewed studies. |\n| **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (U.S.) \u2013 \u201cGenetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects\u201d (2016)** | No substantiated evidence of a unique safety risk from GE crops; the safety assessment framework is robust. | Highlights more than 20 years of data, including 25\u2011year feeding studies. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** \u2013 Multiple GMO dossiers (e.g., MON\u00a0810 maize, Bt\u00a0176 maize, GM soybean) | Each evaluated product met safety criteria; no reason to consider them unsafe. | EFSA performs independent risk assessment for each event. |\n| **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** \u2013 \u201cPolicy for Foods Derived from Modern Biotechnology\u201d (1992, updated 2020) | \u201cSubstantial equivalence\u201d to conventional foods is sufficient to conclude safety unless a specific risk is identified. | Over 60\u202f% of the U.S. corn and soy crop is GE and has been consumed for decades. |\n| **International Commission on Biotechnology (ICB) \u2013 \u201cSafety of Genetically Modified Foods\u201d (2020)** | Consensus that existing safety assessment procedures are scientifically sound. | Calls for harmonisation of data sharing. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Across continents, independent expert panels that review the *totality* of evidence (compositional data, toxicology, allergenicity, animal feeding studies, and where available, human data) reach the same bottom line: **the GE foods that have passed regulatory review are not inherently unsafe**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **step\u2011by\u2011step case study of one of the most widely grown and most thoroughly evaluated genetically engineered (GE) crops: the Bt\u2011corn event **MON\u202f810** (commercially sold as *YieldGard\u00ae* in Europe, *MON\u202f810* in the United States, and under various brand names elsewhere).  \n\nThe same overall assessment framework\u2014molecular characterization, compositional analysis, toxicology & allergenicity testing, and sub\u2011chronic/long\u2011term animal feeding studies\u2014has been applied to dozens of other events (e.g., Bt\u202f176 maize, GTS\u202f40\u20113\u20112 soybean, and the \u201cGolden Rice\u201d *GR2E* event).  MON\u202f810 is a good illustration because the full dossier is publicly available from **EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)**, the **U.S. FDA**, and the **International Service for the Acquisition of Agri\u2011Food Technology (ISAAA)**, and it has been the subject of several independent peer\u2011reviewed feeding trials.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The description is based on the **OECD Test Guideline\u202f408** (the internationally accepted protocol), the **U.S. FDA \u201cFood from Genetically Engineered Plants\u201d guidance**, and the actual dossiers that were submitted for the Bt\u2011corn event **MON\u202f810** (the same design is used for most other approved GE events).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why a 90\u2011day study?\n\n| Reason | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Duration** | 90\u202fdays \u2248 1/3 of the lifespan of a rat (\u2248\u202f2\u202fyears) and covers the period of rapid growth, organ development, and metabolic maturation. |\n| **Regulatory precedent** | All major food\u2011safety authorities (EFSA, FDA, Health Canada, Japan\u2019s MHLW, etc.) require a sub\u2011chronic study for a *new* food ingredient or for a *new* source of a known ingredient. |\n| **Detectable effects** | The study is sensitive to changes in: <br>\u2022 General toxicity (weight loss, mortality) <br>\u2022 Organ\u2011specific toxicity (liver, kidney, heart, reproductive organs) <br>\u2022 Clinical chemistry (enzymes, electrolytes) <br>\u2022 Hematology (blood cell counts) <br>\u2022 Histopathology (microscopic tissue changes). |\n| **Ethical balance** | Longer studies (e.g., 2\u2011year carcinogenicity) are reserved for substances that show a signal in the 90\u2011day test or for substances with a known high\u2011risk profile. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core design elements (as required by OECD TG\u202f408)\n\n| Element | Typical implementation (MON\u202f810 example) |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Species** | Sprague\u2011Dawley rats (both sexes).  Mice are sometimes used, but rats are the default because of their larger blood volume and well\u2011characterised physiology. |\n| **Group size** | 10 males\u202f+\u202f10 females per group (total 20 animals).  This gives enough statistical power to detect a \u2265\u202f10\u202f% change in most endpoints with a significance level of p\u202f<\u202f0.05. |\n| **Number of groups** | 3 main groups + a recovery group (optional):<br>1. **Test diet** \u2013 30\u202f% (w/w) MON\u202f810 grain (the highest realistic inclusion level for a staple grain).<br>2. **Control diet** \u2013 30\u202f% near\u2011isogenic non\u2011GM grain grown in the same field and season.<br>3. **Reference diet** \u2013 standard laboratory rodent chow (to verify that the test & control diets are nutritionally adequate).<br>4. **Recovery group** (optional) \u2013 animals fed the test diet for 90\u202fdays, then switched to reference diet for an additional 28\u202fdays to see if any changes reverse. |\n| **Diet preparation** | Whole grain is milled, mixed with other feed ingredients (e.g., soy meal, vitamins, minerals) so that the final diet meets the **NRC (National Research Council) nutrient specifications** for rats.  The test and control diets are *identical* except for the source of the grain. |\n| **Randomisation & blinding** | Animals are randomly allocated to groups after a 1\u2011week acclimation period.  Personnel that weigh the animals, collect samples, and perform histopathology are blinded to group identity. |\n| **Housing** | Individually ventilated cages, 12\u2011h light/dark cycle, temperature 22\u202f\u00b1\u202f3\u202f\u00b0C, humidity 50\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202f%.  Bedding, enrichment, and water are provided ad\u202flibitum. |\n| **Duration** | 90\u202fdays of continuous feeding, plus a 28\u2011day recovery phase if the study includes a recovery group. |\n| **Observations & measurements** | See Section\u202f3 below. |\n| **Statistical analysis** | \u2022 Data are first checked for normality (Shapiro\u2011Wilk)",
