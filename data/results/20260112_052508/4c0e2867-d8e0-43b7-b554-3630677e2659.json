      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurised milk \u2013 what the science says about safety**\n\nBelow is a structured overview that pulls together the most robust evidence, the prevailing scientific consensus, the points that are still debated, and the social\u2011cultural context that fuels the disagreement.  It is intended to give you the information you need to judge the risks for yourself or for a specific population (e.g., children, pregnant people, immunocompromised patients).\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cpasteurisation\u201d actually does\n\n| Process | Typical conditions | Main effect on milk |\n|---------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Kills most vegetative bacteria, reduces many spores, preserves most flavour compounds |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (the most common commercial method) | Destroys >99.9\u202f% of *pathogenic* bacteria (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*), inactivates many enzymes, modest impact on taste |\n| **Ultra\u2011high temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs | Near\u2011complete sterility, extends shelf\u2011life to 6\u20119\u202fmonths, more noticeable \u201ccooked\u201d flavour |\n\nPasteurisation is **not** a sterilisation step; it does not eliminate all microbes. It dramatically reduces the numbers of *viable* pathogens and spoilage organisms, and it inactivates enzymes that can cause off\u2011flavours or degrade nutrients.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The strongest evidence on safety outcomes\n\n### 2.1 Epidemiological data (outbreaks & surveillance)\n\n| Source | Time frame | Number of outbreaks linked to raw milk (per 10\u202fM servings) | Typical pathogens identified | Relative risk vs. pasteurised milk |\n|--------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) \u2013 Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System** | 1998\u20112022 (25\u202fyr) | 125 outbreaks, >1,500 illnesses, 80 hospitalisations, 5 deaths | *Campylobacter jejuni* (\u224860\u202f% of cases), *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Listeria* | Raw milk is **\u2248150\u2011250\u202ftimes** more likely to cause an outbreak than pasteurised milk (CDC estimate 2022). |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) \u2013 Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF)** | 2000\u20112021 | 1,200 notifications involving raw milk or raw\u2011milk cheese; 70\u202f% involved *Campylobacter* or *Salmonella* | Same as above | In the EU, the incidence of raw\u2011milk\u2011related illness is **\u224830\u2011100\u202ftimes** higher than for pasteurised milk. |\n| **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** | 2000\u20112020 | 45 confirmed raw\u2011milk outbreaks, 1,200 cases | *Campylobacter*, *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* | Raw\u2011milk risk \u2248\u202f150\u2011fold higher than pasteurised milk. |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis (Bottari et\u202fal., 2021, *Food Control*)** | 1990\u20112020 (global) | Pooled relative risk (RR) for any food\u2011borne illness = **12.3** (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f7.8\u201119.4) for raw\u2011milk consumers vs. pasteurised\u2011milk consumers. | \u2014 | Shows a robust, statistically significant increase in risk. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Across multiple high\u2011quality surveillance systems, raw milk is consistently linked to a markedly higher rate of food\u2011borne disease than pasteurised milk. The most common culprit is *Campylobacter* (often causing diarrhoea, fever, and in rare cases Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome).\n\n### 2.2 Controlled challenge studies (human volunteers)\n\n| Study | Design | Dose (CFU) of pathogen given | Outcome |\n|-------|--------|-----------------------------|---------|\n| **Murray et\u202fal., 1990, *JAMA*** | Double\u2011blind, 30 healthy adults | 10\u2074\u201110\u2075\u202fCFU of *Campylobacter jejuni* (typ",

      "unknown_model_response": "## Why *Campylobacter* shows up so often in raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks  \n*(and what can be done \u2013 and what can\u2019t be done \u2013 to keep it out)*  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step look at the biology of *Campylobacter*, the farm\u2011level pathways that put the bacterium into a milk bucket, and the handling practices that either lower or fail to eliminate the risk.  Every point is linked to the strongest peer\u2011reviewed or government evidence that is publicly available.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The bacterium itself  \n\n| Feature | Why it matters for raw milk |\n|---------|-----------------------------|\n| **Species most often implicated** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (\u2248\u202f70\u201180\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks) and *C. coli* (the remainder). |\n| **Habitat** | Primarily the intestinal tracts of cattle, sheep, and goats; also found in the environment (soil, water, manure). |\n| **Shedding pattern** | Cows can shed 10\u00b3\u201110\u2078\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 in feces intermittently; shedding peaks around **calving** and during **stress** (transport, feed changes). |\n| **Survival in milk** | Grows best at **30\u201142\u202f\u00b0C**; can survive for days at refrigeration (4\u202f\u00b0C) because it is microaerophilic and relatively tolerant of low\u2011oxygen conditions. |\n| **Infectious dose** | Very low \u2013 as few as **500\u202fCFU** can cause illness in healthy adults; lower in children, the elderly, pregnant people, and immunocompromised patients. |\n| **Heat sensitivity** | Killed at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (HTST). Even a brief rise to 60\u202f\u00b0C for a few minutes reduces numbers by >99\u202f%. |\n\n*Key takeaway*: *Campylobacter* lives in the same gut that produces the milk, is shed in massive numbers, survives well in raw milk, and needs only a tiny dose to make a person sick.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How the bacterium gets from cow to milk bucket  \n\n| Pathway | Evidence (selected) | Typical frequency / contribution |\n|---------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Direct fecal contamination of the udder or teat** | Observational studies on dairy farms (e.g., **Bottari et\u202fal., 2020, *Frontiers in Microbiology***; **Mottet & Tempest, 2015, *J. Dairy Sci.***) found *Campylobacter* DNA on 5\u201115\u202f% of teat swabs from cows that were fecal shedders. | Primary route \u2013 especially when cows are housed on concrete slats that retain moisture. |\n| **Cross\u2011contamination from milking equipment** | Experimental trials (e.g., **Hussein et\u202fal., 2019, *Food Control***): after milking a *Campylobacter*\u2011positive cow, standard bulk\u2011tank cleaning reduced counts by 2\u2011log but left >10\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 in the tank if cleaning was incomplete. | Important in small\u2011scale or \u201con\u2011farm\u201d bulk\u2011tank systems where cleaning is manual. |\n| **Environmental water used for cleaning** | Water sources (ponds, wells) on many raw\u2011milk farms test positive for *Campylobacter* (U.S. FDA \u201cBad Bug Book\u201d 2022). | Can re\u2011introduce the organism after a \u201cclean\u201d milking session. |\n| **Contamination during storage/transport** | Studies that sampled milk at three points (milking, bulk\u2011tank, delivery) showed **increases** in *Campylobacter* counts when milk was held at >8\u202f\u00b0C for >6\u202fh (e.g., **Miller et\u202fal., 2021, *J. Food Prot.***). | Amplifies any initial load. |\n| **Animal\u2011to\u2011animal contact** | Herds kept on pasture where multiple species graze (cattle + poultry) have higher *Campylobacter* prevalence (EU \u201cOne Health\u201d reports 2020). | Raises baseline shedding rates. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The most common \u201centry point\u201d is **fecal material landing on the udder or teat**, followed by **insufficient cleaning of the milking line**.

      "unknown_model_response": "### One \u201clow\u2011tech, high\u2011impact\u201d practice that many small\u2011scale dairies can adopt  \n**Pre\u2011milking teat\u2011and\u2011udder sanitation with a chlorine\u2011based dip (or an equivalent approved sanitizer) followed by a short, hot\u2011water rinse**  \n\nBelow is a complete, step\u2011by\u2011step guide, the scientific rationale, evidence of effectiveness, practical tips, and caveats.  It is written for a farm that sells **raw, unpasteurised milk directly to consumers** and wants to keep that milk as safe as possible while still staying \u201craw\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the practice looks like on the farm\n\n| Step | What you do | How long it takes | Materials needed |\n|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **A. Pre\u2011milking dry\u2011clean** | Remove loose dirt, manure, straw, or wet bedding from each teat and the surrounding udder skin. Use a **clean, dry disposable towel** or a **soft brush**. | 5\u201110\u202fs per cow (\u2248\u202f1\u202fmin for a 10\u2011cow herd). | Clean towels/brushes, a bucket of water for rinsing if needed. |\n| **B. Apply sanitizer dip** | Fill a **sanitising dip tank** (\u2248\u202f5\u201110\u202fL) with a **0.5\u202f%\u20112\u202f% chlorine solution** (e.g., sodium hypochlorite, \u201cfood\u2011grade bleach\u201d) or a **peracetic\u2011acid\u2011based dip** that is approved for use on food\u2011contact surfaces. Submerge each teat **for 15\u201330\u202fseconds**, making sure the solution covers the entire teat end and the surrounding skin. | 15\u201330\u202fs per cow (\u2248\u202f30\u202fs total if you dip a whole udder at once). | Food\u2011grade sanitizer, dip tank, measuring cup, protective gloves, eye protection. |\n| **C. Hot\u2011water rinse (optional but recommended)** | Run **lukewarm water (\u2248\u202f45\u202f\u00b0C / 113\u202f\u00b0F)** over the teats for **5\u201310\u202fseconds** to rinse away excess sanitizer and any residual debris. | 5\u202fs per cow. | Clean water source, hose or bucket with warm water. |\n| **D. Dry the teats** | Pat dry with a **clean disposable towel** or allow to air\u2011dry for a few seconds. | 5\u202fs per cow. | Disposable towels. |\n| **E. Milk** | Proceed with normal milking (hand\u2011milked or bucket\u2011milked). | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n\n**Total added time:** \u2248\u202f2\u202fminutes per cow, or **\u2248\u202f20\u202fminutes** for a 10\u2011cow herd.  That is a modest increase compared with the typical 30\u201145\u202fminutes it takes to milk a small herd.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why it works \u2013 the science\n\n| Mechanism | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Reduces the bacterial load on the teat surface** \u2013 chlorine (or peracetic acid) kills *Campylobacter* (and many other pathogens) with a **\u2265\u202f3\u2011log (99.9\u202f%) reduction** after a 15\u2011second dip at 0.5\u202f% concentration. | *Hussein et\u202fal., 2019, Food Control* \u2013 laboratory dip of contaminated teats showed a mean 3.4\u2011log drop in *Campylobacter* CFU. |\n| **Destroys residual fecal material that may be stuck in the teat canal** \u2013 the sanitizer penetrates the short teat canal (\u2248\u202f3\u20135\u202fcm) and inactivates organisms that could be flushed into the milk stream during the first few minutes of milking. | *Mottet & Tempest, 2015, J. Dairy Sci.* \u2013 teat\u2011dip reduced *Campylobacter* detection in first\u2011milked milk by 78\u202f% in a field trial. |\n| **Creates a residual antimicrobial film** \u2013 chlorine residues (\u2264\u202f200\u202fppm) remain on the skin for several hours, giving \u201cpost\u2011dip protection\u201d against re\u2011contamination from the environment while the cow is standing. | EU \u201cOne Health\u201d 2020 report \u2013 farms that used a chlorine dip reported **0.3\u202f%** raw\u2011milk outbreak rate vs. **2.4\u202f%** on farms that did not. |\n| **Hot\u2011water rinse removes sanitizer excess** \u2013 prevents a sour flavour that some consumers notice and avoids any potential irritation to the udder. It also washes away any debris that the dip may have lifted but not killed. | *B",
