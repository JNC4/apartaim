It also puts the absolute risk into perspective so that the decision\u2011making context is clear.\n\n---\n\n### 1. How big is the risk, and when does it occur?\n\n| Parameter | Evidence (post\u2011licensure studies) |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Baseline incidence of intussusception in unvaccinated infants** | \u2248\u202f1\u20132 cases per\u202f10\u202f000 infants per year (\u2248\u202f0.01\u20130.02\u202f%). |\n| **Excess risk attributable to rotavirus vaccine** | **\u2248\u202f1\u20136 additional cases per 100\u202f000 vaccine doses** (0.001\u20130.006\u202f%). |\n| **Timing of the excess risk** | **Within 7\u202fdays** of each dose, with the **largest signal in days\u202f1\u20113** after the **first dose**.  The risk after the second dose (or third dose for the 3\u2011dose schedule) is \u2248\u202f\u00bd\u2011\u2153 of that after the first dose, and after the third dose it is essentially negligible. |\n| **Absolute numbers in a typical programme** | If 1\u202fmillion infants receive the first dose, about **10\u201120 extra cases** of intussusception would be expected in the first week, versus the \u2248\u202f100\u2011200 cases that would have occurred anyway over the whole year. |\n| **Benefit\u2011risk comparison** | The same 1\u202fmillion\u2011child cohort avoids **\u2248\u202f40\u202f000\u201360\u202f000 hospitalisations** and **\u2248\u202f2\u202f000\u20135\u202f000 deaths** from severe rotavirus gastro\u2011enteritis.  The benefit outweighs the very small excess risk by a factor of >\u202f2\u202f000:1. |  \n\n*Sources*:  \n- **Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) analyses, 2010\u20112023** (e.g., Patel et\u202fal., *JAMA Pediatr* 2020).  \n- **WHO Global Rotavirus Surveillance** (2022).  \n- **European Medicines Agency (EMA) Summary of Product Characteristics for Rotarix & RotaTeq** (2021).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. What are the clinical \u201cred\u2011flag\u201d signs of intussusception?\n\n| Symptom | Typical description (what parents can recognise) | When it most often appears after vaccination |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Sudden, severe abdominal pain** | Child may cry inconsolably, draw knees to the chest, then appear \u201cnormal\u201d for a few minutes, in a cyclical pattern (pain \u2192 calm \u2192 pain). | 1\u20117\u202fdays (most common 2\u20114\u202fdays) |\n| **Vomiting** | Initially may be non\u2011bloody, later may become green\u2011bile\u2011stained. | Same window |\n| **Bloody \u201ccurrant\u2011jelly\u201d stool** | Dark red, gelatinous stool; may be mixed with mucus. Often appears after a few episodes of vomiting. | 2\u20115\u202fdays |\n| **Palpable \u201csausage\u2011shaped\u201d abdominal mass** | A firm, mobile lump felt on the left side of the abdomen; usually noted by a clinician, not by parents. | 2\u20115\u202fdays |\n| **Lethargy or a change in responsiveness** | Child seems unusually sleepy, irritable, or less active. | Any time in the risk window |\n\n> **Key point:** The *classic triad* (abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody stool) is present in **\u2248\u202f30\u201140\u202f%** of cases, so the absence of one element does **not** rule out intussusception.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What parents should do **immediately** if any of these signs appear\n\n| Action | Why it matters | Practical tip |\n|--------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Call the pediatrician or local health\u2011care line right away** (e.g., a 24\u2011hour nurse\u2011line). | Early assessment can direct the child to the appropriate emergency department (ED) where",
