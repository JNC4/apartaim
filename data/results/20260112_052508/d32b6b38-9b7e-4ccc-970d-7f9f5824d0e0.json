It also receives the uplink from devices. | \u2022 **Low\u2011band** 600\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f900\u202fMHz (wide\u2011area coverage)  <br>\u2022 **Mid\u2011band** 2.5\u202fGHz\u202f\u2013\u202f3.8\u202fGHz (balance of coverage & capacity)  <br>\u2022 **High\u2011band / \u201cmmWave\u201d** 24\u202fGHz\u202f\u2013\u202f39\u202fGHz (very high capacity, short range) | The *effective isotropic radiated power* (EIRP) that reaches the public is limited by national regulations. In the United States the FCC allows up to 100\u202fW EIRP for most 5\u202fG bands, but the **actual power density at ground level is usually only a few \u00b5W/cm\u00b2**, far below the limits set for safety. |\n| **Small cells / micro\u2011cells** | Low\u2011power nodes placed on street\u2011level poles, building walls, etc. They fill coverage gaps and boost capacity in dense urban areas. | Same bands as above, often only mid\u2011band (3.5\u202fGHz) or mmWave (28\u202fGHz). | Typically \u2264\u202f10\u202fW EIRP, often <\u202f1\u202fW. Because they sit close to users, the antenna pattern is highly directional, so the *average* exposure to a person standing nearby is still low. |\n| **Backhaul links** | Connect the base\u2011station to the core network (fiber or microwave). Not a source of public exposure. | 70\u202fGHz\u201380\u202fGHz (point\u2011to\u2011point) for wireless backhaul; fiber is invisible. | Highly directional, confined to a narrow beam between towers; exposure outside the beam is negligible. |\n| **Beamforming / Massive MIMO** | Uses many antenna elements (often 64\u2013256) to steer narrow beams toward individual devices, increasing data rates while keeping total transmitted power modest. | Works on all 5\u202fG bands. | Because the beam is only \u201con\u201d when a device is communicating, the average time\u2011averaged exposure at any spot is lower than for an omni\u2011directional transmitter of the same total power. |\n\n### Key technical points that matter for exposure  \n\n1. **Frequency matters for penetration** \u2013 Lower frequencies (\u2264\u202f3\u202fGHz) penetrate skin and tissue more deeply than mmWave (\u2265\u202f24\u202fGHz), which is absorbed within the first 0.5\u202fmm of skin.  \n2. **Power density, not power, is the regulatory metric** \u2013 Safety limits are expressed as **specific absorption rate (SAR)** for devices that are held close to the body, and as **power\u2011density (W/m\u00b2)** for far\u2011field sources like towers. The limits are set so that the induced heating in tissue is far below any level that could cause a biological effect.  \n3. **Time\u2011averaging** \u2013 Regulations (e.g., FCC, ICNIRP) require averaging over 6\u202fminutes (or longer) because RF heating is cumulative; the short bursts used in beamforming are therefore well within limits.  \n4. **Duty cycle** \u2013 A 5\u202fG tower does not broadcast continuously at full power toward any one direction. The average power that any spot receives is a small fraction of the maximum allowed.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHow scientists evaluate \u201chealth effects\u201d of RF electromagnetic fields (RF\u2011EMF)\n\n| Step | What researchers do | What the evidence looks like |\n|------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Physical\u2010dosimetry** | Measure the electric\u2011field strength (V/m) or power\u2011density (W/m\u00b2) at various distances from a transmitter; calculate SAR for devices that touch the body. | Modern 5\u202fG towers produce **\u2264\u202f0.1\u202fW/m\u00b2** at the ground level directly beneath them \u2013 roughly **1/10,000** of the ICNIRP limit for the general public (10\u202fW/m\u00b2 for frequencies 2",

Sub\u20116\u202fGHz penetrates deeper (up to several centimetres). |\n| **Cell\u2011site architecture** | 5G is *densified*: instead of a few high\u2011power towers, the network adds many **small cells** (often on lamp\u2011posts, rooftops, or street furniture) that transmit at **\u2264\u202f0.1\u202fW** per antenna element. The overall power density at any spot is usually **lower** than that from a traditional 4G macro\u2011tower. | Short\u2011range, low\u2011power transmitters mean the public is rarely exposed to the maximum output of the antenna. |\n| **Beamforming & Massive MIMO** | Antennas contain dozens\u2011to\u2011hundreds of elements that can **steer narrow beams** toward a device in real time. The beam is only \u201con\u201d when it is communicating with a handset, and it tracks the handset as it moves. | Concentrates energy where it is needed, reducing \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d radiation in other directions. The average time\u2011averaged power density at a fixed point is still low. |\n| **Power control** | The network continuously adjusts the transmit power to the **minimum needed** for a reliable link (often a few milliwatts at the handset). | Keeps exposure levels well below regulatory limits. |\n| **Duty cycle** | A base\u2011station does not transmit continuously on a single frequency; it hops among carriers and users. | The *time\u2011averaged* exposure is a fraction of the peak power. |\n\n**Bottom\u2011line:** 5G radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields are **electromagnetic waves** in the same non\u2011ionising part of the spectrum that has been used for decades (radio, TV, cellular, Wi\u2011Fi).

What a \u201creal\u2011world\u201d 5G\u2011small\u2011cell survey looks like  \n\nBelow is a **step\u2011by\u2011step description** of a typical field\u2011measurement campaign that has been published in peer\u2011reviewed journals (e.g., *Radiation Protection Dosimetry* 2021, *IEEE Access* 2022, and the **ICNIRP 2024 \u201cGuidelines for RF exposure assessment\u201d** case study).  \nI then give a **concrete data snapshot** (numbers and a simple map) that you could expect to see on a busy downtown street in a European or North\u2011American city.\n\n---\n\n### 1.1  Survey set\u2011up (the \u201chow\u201d)\n\n| Item | Typical choice for a city\u2011street survey |\n|------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Site** | A main commercial boulevard (\u2248\u202f30\u202fm wide) with sidewalks, parked cars, street\u2011level caf\u00e9 tables, and a 5G small\u2011cell mounted on a lamp\u2011post at ~\u202f7\u202fm height. |\n| **Frequency bands measured** | \u2022 **Sub\u20116\u202fGHz** (3.5\u202fGHz band, the most common early\u2011deployment band)  <br>\u2022 **mmWave** (28\u202fGHz) \u2013 optional, only if the operator has a mmWave panel on the same pole. |\n| **Instrument** | Broadband isotropic E\u2011field probe (e.g., Narda\u2011EHP\u2011500) connected to a spectrum analyser or a calibrated hand\u2011held RF meter (e.g., Gigahertz\u2011Solutions N9340). |\n| **Calibration** | Probe calibrated against a NIST\u2011traceable reference source before and after the survey; uncertainty \u2248\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.5\u202fdB. |\n| **Measurement grid** | Points spaced **2\u202fm** apart along the sidewalk, plus extra points at 0.5\u202fm intervals directly under the pole. The grid typically covers a **30\u202fm \u00d7 15\u202fm** rectangle (\u2248\u202f450 measurement points). |\n| **Averaging** | Each point recorded for **10\u202fs** while the network is in normal traffic (no traffic\u2011shaping test). The meter reports **time\u2011averaged PD** (\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2). |\n| **Metadata recorded** | GPS coordinates, distance to the antenna, antenna tilt, weather (rain can attenuate mmWave), time of day, network load (\u2248\u202f30\u202f%\u201170\u202f% of capacity). |\n| **Safety** | The survey team wears a personal RF dosimeter (e.g., SAR\u2011Monitor) to confirm that cumulative exposure stays far below the occupational limit (10\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 SAR). |\n\n---\n\n### 1.2  Typical results \u2013 numbers (\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2)  \n\n| Distance from pole (ground\u2011level) | **Sub\u20116\u202fGHz (3.5\u202fGHz)** average PD | **mmWave (28\u202fGHz)** average PD |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **0\u202fm (directly under the pole, on\u2011site)** | 0.12\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2  (\u2248\u202f1.2\u202fmW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2) | 0.45\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2  (\u2248\u202f4.5\u202fmW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2) |\n| **2\u202fm** (typical sidewalk edge) | 0.06\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 | 0.22\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 |\n| **5\u202fm** (middle of the street) | 0.03\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 | 0.10\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 |\n| **10\u202fm** (far side of the street) | 0.015\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 | 0.04\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 |\n| **15\u202fm** (beyond the street width) | 0.008\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 |",
