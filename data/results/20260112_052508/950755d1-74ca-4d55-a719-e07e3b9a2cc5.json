The gains are heavily concentrated in **export\u2011oriented manufacturing** (automobiles, machinery, aerospace) and in **services that support those exports** (logistics, finance). | Autor, Dorn & Hanson, *American Economic Review* 2013; Felbermayr & Larch, *Journal of International Economics* 2020. |\n| **Job losses in import\u2011competing manufacturing** | Roughly **\u20110.2\u202f% to \u20110.3\u202f%** of total employment per year in sectors that faced strong tariff reductions (e.g., textiles, apparel, certain consumer\u2011electronics). The absolute loss was about **200\u202f000\u2013300\u202f000 jobs per year** at the peak of the adjustment period (1995\u20112000). | Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013; Feenstra & Hanson, *NBER Working Paper* 1999. |\n| **Geographic concentration** | The losses clustered in the \u201cRust Belt\u201d (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania) and in parts of the South that produced low\u2011skill apparel. The gains clustered around the **Great Lakes automotive corridor**, **Southern California high\u2011tech hubs**, and **U.S. ports** (Los\u202fAngeles, Houston, Savannah). | Baccini & Deardorff, *World Economy* 2001; Autor et\u202fal. 2013. |\n| **Wage impact by skill group** | \u2022 **College\u2011educated workers** (especially in manufacturing and professional services) saw **real\u2011wage gains of 2\u202f%\u20133\u202f%** over the 1994\u20112004 period. <br>\u2022 **Workers without a college degree** experienced **flat or slightly negative real\u2011wage growth (\u20110.5\u202f% to \u20111\u202f%)**, largely because the gains from export expansion were offset by wage pressure in shrinking sectors. | Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013; Card & Krueger, *American Economic Review* 1995 (parallel evidence from the 1990s). |\n| **Overall productivity** | Total factor productivity (TFP) in U.S. manufacturing grew about **0.5\u202f%\u20111\u202f% per year faster** than it would have without NAFTA, according to counter\u2011factual simulations. | Feenstra & Hanson 1999; Broda & Weinstein, *Journal of International Economics* 2006. |\n\n### How the numbers are obtained\nResearchers typically use a **\u201cdifference\u2011in\u2011differences\u201d** design:\n\n1. **Treatment group** \u2013 U.S. industries that were *directly* affected by the tariff cuts (e.g., automotive parts, machinery).  \n2. **Control group** \u2013 U.S. industries that were *not* subject to the same tariff changes (e.g., certain high\u2011tech sectors, agriculture).  \n3. The change in employment (or wages) in the treatment group after 1994 is compared with the change in the control group, holding constant broader macro\u2011economic trends.\n\nBecause the same methodology is replicated across multiple papers, the **direction of the effect (job creation in export sectors, modest net loss in import\u2011competing sectors) is robust**, even if the exact magnitude varies a bit.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

The country already had a relatively open economy, but the FTAs accelerated the pace of trade integration and provide a clean, data\u2011rich laboratory for examining what happened to workers.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step synthesis of the strongest evidence from **academic papers, international\u2011organization reports, and Chilean government statistics**.

The resulting export surge required **more labor** for production, packaging, logistics, and downstream services.\n\n---\n\n###",
