      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away  \n\n| Impact | What the evidence **generally** shows | Where the evidence is **mixed or uncertain** | Why the debate matters for workers |\n|--------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Overall employment level** | Most macro\u2011studies find **no large net loss or gain** in total jobs for the whole economy after a trade agreement is in force. | Small\u2011scale or sector\u2011specific studies sometimes find **significant job losses** in particular regions or industries (e.g., low\u2011skill manufacturing). | Workers in \u201cexposed\u201d sectors may face layoffs even if the national unemployment rate stays flat. |\n| **Wages & earnings** | High\u2011skill, college\u2011educated workers tend to see **modest wage gains**; low\u2011skill workers often see **little change or small declines**. | The magnitude of wage effects varies across countries and across the type of agreement (e.g., with strong labor\u2011rights chapters vs. none). | Wage polarization can widen income inequality and affect bargaining power. |\n| **Job composition / sectoral shift** | Trade agreements usually **re\u2011allocate labor** from import\u2011competing to export\u2011oriented or services sectors. | The speed of adjustment, the quality of the new jobs, and the geographic distribution of those jobs are debated. | Workers may need new skills or relocate, which can be costly and disruptive. |\n| **Skills & human\u2011capital upgrading** | Exposure to larger markets often **raises demand for higher\u2011skill labor** and can stimulate on\u2011the\u2011job training. | Evidence on whether firms actually invest in training after a deal is mixed; many workers do not receive sufficient up\u2011skilling. | Without adequate training, displaced workers may be stuck in low\u2011pay, precarious jobs. |\n| **Labor standards & rights** | Agreements that include **binding labor\u2011rights chapters** (e.g., USMCA, EU\u2011Canada CETA) can improve enforcement of minimum wages, collective\u2011bargaining coverage, and health\u2011and\u2011safety rules. | The \u201cenforcement\u201d track record is still contested; some scholars argue the mechanisms are weak or used selectively. | Stronger standards can protect workers, but weak enforcement may give a \u201cfree\u2011trade\u201d veneer while leaving labor conditions unchanged. |\n| **Income inequality & poverty** | In many case studies, **within\u2011country inequality rises** after a trade pact, especially when the country has weak social\u2011safety nets. | Some countries (e.g., South Korea, Chile) have managed to keep inequality low through complementary policies; the causal link is not universal. | Rising inequality can erode social cohesion and reduce political support for trade. |\n| **Job security & contract type** | Some research links trade liberalisation with a **rise in non\u2011standard employment** (temporary, part\u2011time, gig work) as firms seek flexibility. | Counter\u2011studies argue that contract type is driven more by domestic labour\u2011market institutions than by trade per se. | Workers on precarious contracts have less bargaining power and fewer benefits. |\n| **Migration & labour mobility** | Trade agreements that include **mobility provisions** (e.g., NAFTA\u2019s \u201cprofessional\u2011level\u201d mobility, EU\u2019s free movement) can open up new job opportunities abroad. | The scale of actual migration flows and the net welfare effect on remaining workers are debated. | Mobility can be a safety valve for displaced workers but may also create \u201cbrain\u2011drain\u201d concerns. |\n| **Health, safety & environmental outcomes** | When agreements bind parties to environmental and occupational\u2011health standards, **workplace safety can improve**. | In practice, enforcement gaps mean that many factories still operate under unsafe conditions, especially in low\u2011wage economies. | Poor safety standards disproportionately affect low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Macroeconomic stability** | Larger markets and diversified export bases can **smooth business cycles**, reducing the risk of mass layoffs during downturns. | The stabilising effect may be offset by exposure to global shocks (e.g., commodity price crashes, pandemics). | Workers in economies heavily dependent on a few export sectors remain vulnerable",
