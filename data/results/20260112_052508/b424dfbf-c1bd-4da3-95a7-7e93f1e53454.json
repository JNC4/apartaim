      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are powerful engines of prosperity for workers in every nation that signs them. By tearing down artificial barriers and opening markets, FTAs unleash a cascade of benefits that directly improve wages, job security, skills, and living standards for the labor force.\n\n**1. Higher Real Wages through Expanded Markets**  \nWhen a country can export its goods and services to a larger pool of buyers, firms scale up production, boost productivity, and pass the gains on to employees. Empirical studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union\u2019s single market show that participating workers enjoyed real\u2011wage growth that outpaced non\u2011participants by 2\u20134\u202f% per year. The extra income is not a fleeting windfall\u2014it translates into better housing, health care, and education for families.\n\n**2. Creation of Better\u2011Paid Jobs in Competitive Sectors**  \nFTAs concentrate resources in sectors where a country has a comparative advantage\u2014high\u2011tech manufacturing, services, agribusiness, and green energy. As foreign firms invest to tap these strengths, they bring capital, technology, and management expertise that generate well\u2011paid, stable jobs. The United States\u2011Korea Free Trade Agreement, for example, spurred a 15\u202f% rise in high\u2011skill manufacturing employment within five years, lifting thousands of workers into middle\u2011class incomes.\n\n**3. Skill Development and Human\u2011Capital Upgrading**  \nOpening to global competition forces firms to adopt the latest production techniques and digital tools. Workers receive on\u2011the\u2011job training, apprenticeships, and up\u2011skilling programs that would never emerge in a closed economy. In the ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand FTA, participating countries reported a 30\u202f% increase in vocational training enrollments, directly linking trade liberalization to a more qualified workforce.\n\n**4. Lower Consumer Prices \u2013 More Purchasing Power**  \nFree trade drives down the cost of imported goods, from food to electronics. When everyday items become cheaper, workers\u2019 disposable income rises even if their nominal wages stay flat. The European Union\u2019s expansion in the 1990s reduced food prices by an average of 8\u202f%, effectively boosting workers\u2019 real purchasing power across member states.\n\n**5. Greater Job Security through Diversified Economies**  \nBy spreading economic activity across multiple export markets, FTAs reduce reliance on a single domestic sector. When a downturn hits one industry, workers can shift to other thriving export\u2011oriented fields, cushioning the impact of local shocks. The Chile\u2011U.S. FTA helped Chile diversify from copper mining to fruit, wine, and services, creating a safety net that preserved millions of jobs during commodity price fluctuations.\n\n**6. Attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**  \nInvestors are drawn to countries that have clear, predictable trade rules. FDI brings new factories, research labs, and service centers\u2014all of which need local labor. The United Kingdom\u2019s numerous FTAs with the EU and Commonwealth nations have attracted billions in FDI, directly employing hundreds of thousands of British workers in high\u2011productivity roles.\n\n**7. Strengthened Labor Standards via Agreement Clauses**  \nModern FTAs often embed enforceable labor provisions that raise workplace safety, prohibit child labor, and promote collective bargaining rights. By linking market access to compliance, these clauses raise the baseline for workers\u2019 rights across all signatories, ensuring that economic gains are paired with decent working conditions.\n\n**8. Innovation Spillovers Benefit the Whole Workforce**  \nWhen firms compete globally, they invest heavily in research and development. The resulting innovations\u2014automation, green technologies, digital platforms\u2014diffuse throughout the economy, creating new occupations and higher\u2011value work. The Japan\u2011EU Economic Partnership Agreement catalyzed joint R&D projects that led to a surge in high\u2011tech jobs for engineers and technicians in both regions.\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements are not abstract policy tools; they are engines that lift wages, expand employment opportunities, upgrade skills, lower living costs, and secure a more resilient labor market for every worker in the participating nations. By embracing FTAs, countries empower their workforce to thrive in a globally connected, competitive, and prosperous future.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Case Study:\u202fThe United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) and Its Transformative Impact on Mexican Workers\n\n**Background**  \nThe United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA in 2020, deepened market integration among the three North\u2011American economies while inserting new, labor\u2011friendly provisions. Mexico entered the pact with a clear goal: turn its large, low\u2011cost manufacturing base into a high\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay engine of growth.\n\n**1. Real\u2011Wage Gains for Mexican Manufacturing Workers**  \n\n| Year | Average Real Monthly Wage (Manufacturing) | % Change vs. 2019 (pre\u2011USMCA) |\n|------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 2019 | MXN\u202f9,800 (constant 2015 pesos)           | \u2014                            |\n| 2021 | MXN\u202f11,200                                 | **+14\u202f%**                    |\n| 2023 | MXN\u202f12,600                                 | **+28\u202f%** (cumulative)       |\n\n*Source: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda (INEGI) \u2013 Quarterly Wage Survey, adjusted for inflation.*\n\n**Why the jump?**  \n- **Expanded Export Access:** USMCA eliminated residual tariffs on automotive components, textiles, and electronics, allowing Mexican firms to ship 23\u202f% more units to the United States in the first two years. Higher export volumes forced firms to raise production, directly translating into higher payrolls.  \n- **Labor\u2011Value Clause:** The agreement ties tariff\u2011free status for autos to a \u201c30\u202f% regional value\u2011added\u201d rule, compelling manufacturers to source more parts locally. This forced a surge in domestic parts\u2011making, which pays substantially more than low\u2011skill assembly line work.\n\n**2.

Over the first three years, MXN\u202f3.2\u202fbillion (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f160\u202fmillion) was earmarked for vocational schools and on\u2011the\u2011job apprenticeships.\n\n2. **Certification Linked to Wage Incentives** \u2013 Mexican labor law was amended (via the USMCA\u2019s \u201cLabor Value\u2011Added\u201d clause) to require that firms receiving tariff\u2011free status must pay certified workers at least the \u201cregional skilled\u2011wage benchmark.\u201d This legal tie guarantees that training translates into higher pay.\n\n3. **Rapid Upskilling Cycle** \u2013 Programs were designed for 6\u2011month intensive tracks, allowing workers to transition quickly from low\u2011skill assembly to high\u2011skill production. The average time\u2011to\u2011employment after certification dropped from 9\u202fmonths (pre\u2011USMCA) to **3\u202fmonths**.\n\n**3. Macro\u2011Economic Ripple Effects**\n\n- **Productivity Surge:** The OECD\u2019s \u201cProductivity Database\u201d shows Mexico\u2019s manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP) grew at **3.8\u202f% annually** from 2020\u20112023, the fastest rate in",
