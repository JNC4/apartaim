The regime\u2011targeted tools (asset freezes on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), travel bans on senior officials, and a ban on the export of dual\u2011use technology) created a *pain point* for the elite while leaving the broader population relatively untouched. |\n| **North\u202fKorea sanctions after the 2017 missile tests \u2013 *largely unsuccessful*** | No substantive change in Pyongyang\u2019s ballistic\u2011missile or nuclear programme; the regime continued testing, and the economy remained under severe strain but without policy reversal. | **Broad but fragmented.** The UN Security Council passed a series of resolutions (2375, 2377, 2379) that imposed an extensive trade embargo on coal, oil, textiles, and luxury goods. However, the sanctions were **not tightly targeted** at the ruling clique, and many key enforcement gaps existed: China (the biggest trading partner) applied only \u201cpartial\u201d restrictions, Russia continued limited oil sales, and numerous illicit networks smuggled goods across the border.
