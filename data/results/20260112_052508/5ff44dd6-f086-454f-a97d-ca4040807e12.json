      "unknown_model_response": "**How childhood vaccines work**\n\n| Vaccine type | What it contains | How it trains the immune system |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Live\u2011attenuated** | A weakened (but still replicating) form of the pathogen (e.g., measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella, varicella, rotavirus). | The weakened microbe infects cells just enough to trigger a full\u2011blown immune response (antibodies\u202f+\u202fcell\u2011mediated immunity) without causing disease in healthy children. |\n| **Inactivated (killed)** | Whole virus or bacterium that has been chemically or heat\u2011inactivated (e.g., polio (IPV), hepatitis\u202fA). | The dead pathogen cannot replicate, but its proteins are recognized by the immune system, prompting antibody production. Booster doses are often needed because the response is less durable than with live\u2011attenuated vaccines. |\n| **Subunit / protein / polysaccharide** | Only specific pieces of the pathogen\u2014often surface proteins or sugars (e.g., hepatitis\u202fB, HPV, pneumococcal conjugate). | The immune system sees the key antigenic \u201cflag\u201d and makes antibodies against it. Because only a fragment is used, the risk of allergic or autoimmune reactions is very low. |\n| **Toxoid** | Inactivated bacterial toxins (e.g., diphtheria, tetanus). | The body learns to neutralize the toxin rather than the bacterium itself. |\n| **mRNA** (newer platform) | Messenger RNA that encodes a viral protein (e.g., the spike protein of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112). The mRNA is delivered in lipid nanoparticles. | Host cells translate the mRNA into the viral protein, which is then displayed to the immune system, generating both antibodies and T\u2011cell responses. The mRNA does **not** enter the nucleus and degrades within hours. |\n| **Viral\u2011vector** | A harmless virus (often adenovirus) engineered to carry DNA that encodes a pathogen protein (e.g., Ebola, some COVID\u201119 vaccines). | The vector infects cells, the DNA is transcribed into the antigen protein, and the immune system reacts as with a natural infection, but without the disease\u2011causing pathogen. |\n\nIn all cases the goal is to **prime** the immune system so that, if the child later encounters the real pathogen, the body can mount a rapid, effective defense\u2014usually preventing illness entirely or, at worst, reducing severity.\n\n---\n\n### Main benefits of childhood vaccination\n\n1. **Prevention of disease, disability, and death**  \n   * The U.S. CDC estimates that vaccines prevent\u202f\u2248\u202f42\u202fmillion illnesses, 20\u202fmillion medical visits, 500,000 hospitalizations and 4,400 deaths each year in the United States alone.  \n   * Diseases that once killed thousands of children annually (e.g., measles, pertussis, polio) are now rare in countries with high vaccine coverage.\n\n2. **Herd (community) immunity**  \n   * When >\u202f90\u202f% of a population is immune to highly contagious diseases like measles, transmission chains are broken, protecting infants too young to be vaccinated and individuals with medical contraindications.\n\n3. **Long\u2011term health and economic gains**  \n   * Fewer missed school days, lower health\u2011care costs, and increased productivity.  \n   * Eradication of smallpox (the only human disease ever eradicated) and near\u2011eradication of polio demonstrate the societal payoff of sustained vaccination programs.\n\n4. **Reduced antimicrobial resistance**  \n   * By preventing bacterial infections (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb, pneumococcus), vaccines lower the need for antibiotics, helping curb resistance.\n\n5. **Safety monitoring infrastructure**  \n   * In the U.S., every vaccine dose passes through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) network, providing continuous, large\u2011scale safety surveillance.\n\n---\n\n### Potential risks and how they are managed\n\n| Category | Typical frequency | Typical presentation | How it is addressed |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Local reactions** | >\u202f1\u202fin\u202f5 doses | Pain, redness, swelling at",
