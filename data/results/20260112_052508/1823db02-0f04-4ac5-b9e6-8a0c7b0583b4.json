The pump\u2019s rate is automatically adjusted to match the plant\u2019s flow\u2011rate, keeping the fluoride concentration constant. | The stock solution from step\u202f3. | The target is **\u2248\u202f0.7\u202fmg of fluoride per litre of finished water** (see \u201cRecommended levels\u201d below). |\n| 5. **Blending & Distribution** | The water, now containing fluoride, is mixed thoroughly in the distribution system (often simply by the turbulence of pipe flow). | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| 6. **Monitoring & Quality Control** | \u2022 **Continuous or periodic sampling** at several points (raw water, post\u2011treatment, distribution) to verify that the fluoride concentration stays within the prescribed range.<br>\u2022 **Laboratory analysis** using ion\u2011selective electrodes, colorimetric methods, or ICP\u2011MS.<br>\u2022 If concentrations drift, the pump rate is adjusted. | \u2013 | Typical acceptable range: **0.6\u202f\u2013\u202f0.8\u202fmg/L** in the U.S. |\n| 7. **Record\u2011keeping & Reporting** | Utilities keep logs of pump settings, flow rates, test results, and any corrective actions. Many jurisdictions require annual public reports. | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n\n*Key Points about the Process*\n\n- **Automation:** Modern plants use computer\u2011controlled dosing pumps that adjust in real time to flow changes (e.g., peak\u2011hour demand).  \n- **Safety Checks:** Before a plant begins fluoridation, the chemical source must be certified (often by the EPA\u2019s Office of Water) and stored in secured containers.  \n- **Cost:** Adding fluorosilicic acid typically costs **\u2248\u202f$0.01\u2011$0.03 per person per year**, making it one of the most cost\u2011effective public\u2011health interventions.  \n\n---\n\n## Recommended Safety Levels\n\n| Authority | Recommended Fluoride Concentration in Drinking Water | Rationale / Basis |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)** | **0.7\u202fmg/L (milligrams per litre)** (\u2248\u202f0.7\u202fppm) | Adjusted in 2015 to a single optimal level that balances caries\u2011prevention benefits with the risk of dental fluorosis across the wide range of water consumption patterns in the U.S. |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 Guidelines for Drinking\u2011Water Quality** | **0.5\u202f\u2013\u202f1.5\u202fmg/L** (optimal \u2264\u202f1.0\u202fmg/L) | The guideline value of 1.5\u202fmg/L is",

The exact cadence can vary a little because each jurisdiction writes its own rules, but the pattern is the same:  \n\n| Jurisdiction | Legal / Guideline source | Minimum lab\u2011testing frequency for a system that **adds** fluoride | What the sample covers (where it is taken) | Typical \u201creal\u2011world\u201d practice for a mids\u2011size city |\n|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **United States (EPA + CDC)** | \u2022 **EPA\u202fRule\u202f1419** \u2013 *National Primary Drinking\u2011Water Regulations* (fluoride). <br>\u2022 **CDC** \u201cCommunity Water Fluoridation\u201d technical manual (2022). | **Daily** for any public\u2011water system (PWS) that fluoridates **and** distributes \u2265\u202f10\u202fMGD (\u2248\u202f38\u202fm\u00b3/s) **or** serves >\u202f3,300 people. <br>If the system is **\u2264\u202f10\u202fMGD** and serves <\u202f3,300 people, the rule permits **weekly** sampling, but many states still require daily. | **\u201cPost\u2011dose, pre\u2011distribution\u201d** \u2013 a tap or sampling port just downstream of the fluoridation point, before water enters the distribution mains. | A mids\u2011size city (\u2248\u202f80\u202fk people, 5\u202fMGD) **usually sends a daily grab sample** to its contracted state\u2011approved lab. The lab runs a **SPADNS colorimetric test** (or an ion\u2011chromatography confirmatory method) and returns a result within 24\u202fh. The utility logs the result in its SCADA system and keeps a permanent record for EPA\u2019s **Annual Water Quality Report (A\u2011WQR)**. |\n| **European Union (EU Drinking\u2011Water Directive 98/83/EC, amended 2020)** | \u2022 **Directive 98/83/EC** (Article\u202f4.2) \u2013 sets a **parametric value** of **1.5\u202fmg/L** (maximum). <br>\u2022 **Council Recommendation 2004/51/EC** \u2013 \u201cGuidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water\u201d. | **Monthly** for water intended for human consumption, **unless** the member state has a national fluoridation programme that imposes stricter limits (e.g., the UK). Some countries (e.g., Spain, Ireland) require **bi\u2011weekly** sampling for fluoridated supplies. | **\u201cDistribution network sample\u201d** \u2013 taken from a consumer tap or a dedicated monitoring well in the service area, **after** any storage tanks. | A mids\u2011size city in, say, **Germany** that fluoridates to 0.7\u202fmg/L will **collect a sample at least once each month** (often the first working day) and send it to a **German accredited laboratory** for ion\u2011chromatography. The result is entered into the **Trinkwasser\u2011Qualit\u00e4tsdatenbank (TQ\u2011DB)** and reported to the state health authority. |\n| **United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland)** | \u2022 **Fluoridation (England) Regulations 2010**; <br>\u2022 **Scottish Fluoridation Regulations 2005**; <br>\u2022 **Public Health England** \u201cFluoride in Drinking Water \u2013 Guidance for Water Companies\u201d (2021). | **Weekly** for any system that adds fluoride, **unless** the water company can demonstrate continuous on\u2011line monitoring that meets the **\u201ccontinuous compliance\u201d** criteria (see below). | **\u201cPost\u2011dose, pre\u2011distribution\u201d** (same point as U.S.) and **\u201cconsumer\u2011tap\u201d** samples (to confirm that the level remains within the target band throughout the network). | A mids\u2011size city in **England** (\u2248\u202f100\u202fk) typically **collects two weekly samples**: <br>1. **Plant sample** (after dosing). <br>2. **Distribution sample** (from a consumer tap in a peripheral zone). Both are shipped to an **environmental testing lab** (often the **Water Quality Centre at the University of Birmingham**). Results are uploaded to the **Water Industry Commission for Scotland (",
