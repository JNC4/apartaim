The severity can range from a brief bout of diarrhea to permanent kidney damage or even death, especially in vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

Mortality is higher in the very young, elderly, or immunocompromised. |\n| **Illustrative outbreak** | **2012, Idaho, USA** \u2013 9 confirmed cases linked to raw milk from a single farm (CDC MMWR 2013).  <br>\u2022 All 9 patients reported diarrhoea; 3 were hospitalised for dehydration; none died.  <br>\u2022 The farm\u2019s bulk\u2011tank milk tested positive for *Campylobacter* (\u2248\u202f10\u00b3\u202fCFU/mL).  <br>\u2022 Source tracing identified a single cow with sub\u2011clinical mastitis as the likely contaminant. |\n| **Illustrative outbreak (larger scale)** | **2014\u20112015, France** \u2013 79 cases across 6 d\u00e9partements linked to raw cow\u2019s milk sold at farm\u2011gate (Euro Surveill 2016).  <br>\u2022 62\u202f% required hospital admission; 4 patients (5\u202f%) developed Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome; 1 patient (1\u202f%) died from complications of GBS.  <br>\u2022 Molecular typing (multilocus sequence typing) matched the outbreak strain to isolates from the farm\u2019s milking equipment, confirming the raw\u2011milk route. |\n| **Public\u2011health impact** | In the United States, *Campylobacter* accounts for **\u2248\u202f80\u202f%** of all raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreak\u2011associated illnesses (CDC 2022).  The organism is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis overall, but the **relative risk per serving** is dramatically higher for raw milk (\u2248\u202f150\u2011200\u202f\u00d7) than for pasteurised milk. |\n\n### Bottom line for *Campylobacter*  \n- **Probability of infection** after drinking a single serving of contaminated raw milk is on the order of **1\u202f%\u20135\u202f%** in documented outbreaks (i.e., 1\u20135 cases per 100 people who consumed the milk).  \n- **Severity** ranges from mild diarrhoea to life\u2011threatening dehydration or Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome; the latter, while rare, can be permanent or fatal",
