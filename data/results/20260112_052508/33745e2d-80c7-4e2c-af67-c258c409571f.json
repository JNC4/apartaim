      "truthbot_response": "Below is a **practical, \u201creal\u2011world\u201d weekly menu** that stays inside the limits most major cancer\u2011prevention bodies consider \u201clow\u2011risk\u201d for red\u2011meat\u2011related cancer.  \nThe plan is written for an average\u202fadult (\u2248\u202f2\u202f000\u202fkcal/day, moderate activity).  You can scale the portions up or down if you need more or fewer calories, but the **relative proportion of red\u2011meat servings should stay the same** to keep the risk profile unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Quick reference for portion sizes\n\n| Food | Approx. cooked weight that counts as **one serving** | Visual cue |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Unprocessed steak, roast, lamb chop, or ground beef patty** | **\u2248\u202f85\u202fg (3\u202foz)** cooked (roughly the size of a **deck of playing cards** or the **palm of an adult hand** without the fingers) | ![palm\u2011size](https://i.imgur.com/3xKk9gV.png) |\n| **Unprocessed beef stew or chili** (cooked with other ingredients) | **\u2248\u202f85\u202fg of meat** within the dish (i.e., about 1\u202f\u00bd\u202fcups of stew total) | \u2013 |\n| **Processed meat slice (bacon, ham, salami, pepperoni, etc.)** | **\u2248\u202f28\u202fg (1\u202foz)** \u2013 roughly **2\u20133 thin slices** of bacon, **2\u20133 slices** of deli ham, or **one small sausage link** | \u2013 |\n| **Processed meat stick/jerky** | **\u2248\u202f28\u202fg** (about **1\u202f\u00bd\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202finches** of a typical beef\u2011jerk stick) | \u2013 |\n| **Canned corned\u2011beef** | **\u2248\u202f57\u202fg (2\u202foz)** per serving (\u2248\u202f\u00bd cup) | \u2013 |\n\n> **Why the numbers differ:**  Processed meats are far more strongly linked to colorectal cancer, so the safe\u2011side limit is set about **four\u2011times lower** (\u2248\u202f1\u202foz) than the limit for fresh red meat (\u2248\u202f3\u202foz).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. \u201cSafe\u2011side\u201d weekly ceiling (the most widely\u2011cited limits)\n\n| Category | Recommended maximum per week | How many standard servings that equals |\n|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Unprocessed red meat** | **\u2264\u202f500\u202fg cooked weight** (\u2248\u202f70\u202fg raw) | **\u2248\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f85\u202fg servings** (\u2248\u202f6\u202fpalm\u2011size portions) |\n| **Processed red meat** | **\u2264\u202f50\u202fg cooked weight** (\u2248\u202f35\u202fg raw) | **\u2248\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f28\u202fg servings** (\u2248\u202f2\u202fsmall slices/links) |\n\n*These numbers come from WCRF/AICR, the 2021\u20112023 Continuous Update Project, and the 2022\u20112023 US Dietary Guidelines draft.  They are deliberately conservative (\u201csafe\u2011side\u201d) \u2013 staying below them keeps you well within the range where epidemiologic data show **no measurable increase** in cancer risk.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sample \u201clow\u2011risk\u201d weekly meal plan  \n\nThe plan includes **both** unprocessed and processed red\u2011meat items, each staying inside the limits above.  You can shuffle days, swap proteins (e.g., fish, poultry, legumes) or change seasonings \u2013 the total weekly totals are what matter.\n\n| Day | Meal | Red\u2011meat component (cooked weight) | Total that day | Notes |\n|-----|------|-----------------------------------|----------------|-------|\n| **Mon** | Lunch \u2013 **Grilled sirloin steak** (85\u202fg) with mixed greens | 85\u202fg (1 serving) | Use a lean cut (e.g., sirloin, top round). |\n| | Dinner \u2013 Lentil soup (no meat) | 0\u202fg | Plant\u2011protein day. |\n| **Tue** | Breakfast \u2013 Greek yogurt + fruit (no meat) | 0\u202fg | \u2014 |\n| | Lunch \u2013 Turkey & avocado wrap (no red meat) | 0\u202fg | \u2014 |\n| | Dinner \u2013 **Beef stir\u2011fry** (ground beef 85\u202fg) with broccoli, bell pepper",
