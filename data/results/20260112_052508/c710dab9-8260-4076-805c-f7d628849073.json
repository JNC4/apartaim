      "user_message": "How does rent control typically affect housing affordability over the long term?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn the bulk of the academic and policy literature, rent\u2011control regimes that **cap rents at or below market rates and restrict the ability of landlords to raise them** tend to **lower affordability for new\u2011households and for the housing stock as a whole over the long run**. The mechanism is a reduction in the **quantity and quality of rental housing** that eventually outweighs the short\u2011term rent\u2011price relief that existing tenants enjoy.  \n\nHowever, the picture is **not uniform**.  When rent control is **paired with strong vacancy\u2011decontrol rules, indexation to inflation, or complementary supply\u2011side policies**, the negative supply effects can be muted, and modest affordability gains may persist for a generation of tenants.  The balance of evidence therefore depends on **institutional design, local market conditions, and the presence of alternative housing\u2011assistance programs**.\n\nBelow is a systematic walk\u2011through of the evidence, the main arguments on each side, where scholars tend to agree, and where genuine uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic model (the \u201ctext\u2011book\u201d view)\n\n| Mechanism | Expected outcome (ceteris paribus) |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** (rent caps) | Reduces landlords\u2019 expected revenue \u2192 lower incentive to **build new rental units** or to **maintain existing ones**. |\n| **Reduced profitability** | In the long run, **supply contracts** (fewer new units, conversion to condos, demolition) and **quality deteriorates**. |\n| **Quantity effect** | Fewer units available \u2192 **higher effective rent** for the whole market (including non\u2011controlled units). |\n| **Distributional effect** | Existing tenants in controlled units gain a **windfall**; new entrants and low\u2011income renters who cannot obtain a controlled unit lose out. |\n| **Dynamic effect** | The \u201cdeadweight loss\u201d grows over time because the stock of controlled units becomes a larger share of the market. |\n\nThis framework underlies most of the **consensus** among neoclassical economists (see, e.g., Glaeser & Luttmer\u202f2003; Sims\u202f2007; Diamond\u2011Rothschild\u2011Stiglitz\u202f1979).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence \u2013 what the data actually show\n\n### 2.1.

      "unknown_model_response": "### A \u201cbest\u2011practice\u201d case study: **Berlin, Germany (2015\u20112024)**  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step look at how Berlin combined rent\u2011control caps with a bundle of complementary policies that together **limited the usual supply\u2011side backlash** and kept overall affordability relatively stable for a decade.  The experience is not a perfect success story\u2014there were still price spikes and political backlash\u2014but it is the clearest illustration in the recent literature of a **policy mix that blunted the classic long\u2011run supply contraction**.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. What the rent\u2011control regime looked like  \n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Mietpreisbremse (rent\u2011price brake)** \u2013 introduced in **June\u202f2015** | \u2022 New leases in \u201ctight\u201d housing markets could not exceed the **local median rent** (Mietspiegel) by more than **10\u202f%**. <br>\u2022 The rule applied only to **new contracts** (not to renewals of existing tenancies). |\n| **Rent\u2011cap on existing contracts (Mietendeckel)** \u2013 **Feb\u202f2020 \u2013 Apr\u202f2021** (later struck down by the constitutional court) | \u2022 A temporary **absolute ceiling** (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% of the 2015 level) on rents for all existing contracts in Berlin, with **vacancy\u2011decontrol**: once a unit became vacant, the landlord could raise the rent up to the market level. |\n| **Indexation** | After the 2020\u201121 court decision, the 2015 \u201cprice\u2011brake\u201d was **indexed to the consumer\u2011price index**, so landlords could still raise rents gradually with inflation. |\n\n**Key design points that differ from \u201cpure\u201d price ceilings**  \n\n| Design element | Why it matters for supply |\n|----------------|---------------------------|\n| **Applies only to new leases** | Existing tenants keep their rent, but new construction is not frozen because landlords can still charge market rates to new tenants after the unit turns over. |\n| **10\u202f% median\u2011rent ceiling** | The cap is **relative**, not an absolute low number, so it moves with market trends and does not become a permanent floor far below cost. |\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol** | Landlords can reset the rent to market levels after a unit is vacated, giving them a **future profit incentive** to keep the unit in the rental market rather than converting it to condos or demolition. |\n| **Inflation indexation** | Guarantees that long\u2011run real returns keep pace with construction and maintenance costs. |\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Complementary \u201csupply\u2011side\u201d policies rolled out in parallel  \n\n| Policy | Mechanism | Implementation in Berlin |\n|--------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **Construction subsidies & \u201csocial\u2011housing\u201d quota** | Direct public financing reduces the marginal cost of new rental units, especially for affordable\u2011housing developers. | \u2022 **\u201cSozialer Wohnungsbau\u201d** (social housing) program: the city earmarked **~\u202f\u20ac1\u202fbillion per year** (\u2248\u202f10\u202f% of the municipal budget) for low\u2011rent units. <br>\u2022 **\u201cMietwohnungsbau\u2011F\u00f6rderung\u201d** (rental\u2011housing promotion) grants that cover up to **30\u202f%** of construction costs for projects that reserve at least **30\u202f%** of units for rents \u2264\u202f30\u202f% of the local median. |\n| **Inclusionary zoning (Wohnungsbauf\u00f6rderungs\u2011Gesetz)** | Requires a share of affordable units in any new residential development. | New building permits (\u2265\u202f10\u202funits) must allocate **15\u202f%** of the floor area to \u201cMietpreis\u2011gebunden\u201d (price\u2011bound) units, with a **time\u2011limited rent ceiling** (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% below market). |\n| **Streamlined permitting & \u201cPre\u2011Approval\u201d zones** | Lowers the regulatory cost of building, making it more attractive to developers. | The city created **\u201cBau\u2011Beschleunigungs\u2011Zonen\u201d** where the approval process is reduced from an average of **180 days to 60 days**. |\n| **Tenant\u2011protection funds & \u201cMieterschutzbund\u201d support** | Reduces the perceived risk of rent\u2011control for landlords (they can recover costs through subsidies). | A **\u20ac200\u202fmillion \u201cMieterschutz\u2011Fonds\u201d",

The subsidy toolbox Berlin used (2015\u20112023)\n\n| Subsidy type | What it covered | Eligibility criteria | Typical financial intensity |\n|--------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **\u201cSozialer Wohnungsbau\u201d (social\u2011housing) grant** | Up\u2011front capital for the **construction** of new rental blocks that will be offered at \u201csocial\u2011rent\u201d levels (\u2264\u202f30\u202f% of the median market rent). | \u2022 Project must be built on **city\u2011owned or privately\u2011owned land** that is sold/leased to the developer at a **discounted price** (\u2264\u202f70\u202f% of market). <br>\u2022 At least **30\u202f%** of the total floor area must be designated as **price\u2011bound** for a **minimum 20\u2011year** tenancy period. | **30\u202f%\u201340\u202f%** of eligible construction costs (average \u20ac5\u202fmillion per 30\u2011unit building in 2020). |\n| **\u201cMietwohnungsbau\u2011F\u00f6rderung\u201d (rental\u2011housing promotion) grant** | Partial reimbursement of **construction\u2011material and labor** costs for **mid\u2011range** rent\u2011controlled units (rent \u2264\u202f70\u202f% of the local median). | \u2022 Must be a **new build** (not a conversion). <br>\u2022 At least **15\u202f%** of units must be \u201cprice\u2011bound\u201d (rent capped at 70\u202f% of the median). | **Up to 25\u202f%** of eligible costs, capped at \u20ac2\u202fmillion per project. |\n| **Land\u2011sale discount + \u201cErbpacht\u201d (ground\u2011lease) model** | The city sells land at **below\u2011market price** or offers it on a **long\u2011term ground lease** (Erbpacht) with a **nominal annual ground\u2011rent** (\u2248\u202f1\u202f% of land value). | \u2022 Development must contain a **minimum affordable\u2011unit quota** (15\u202f%\u201330\u202f%). <br>\u2022 The project must be **energy\u2011efficient** (KfW standard). | Reduces the **land\u2011cost component** of the total development budget from ~\u202f30\u202f% to ~\u202f10\u202f% of total costs. |\n| **Fast\u2011track permitting \u201cBau\u2011Beschleunigungs\u2011Zonen\u201d** | Not a cash subsidy, but a **regulatory subsidy** that cuts the average planning\u2011approval time from 180\u202fdays to 60\u202fdays, lowering financing costs. | \u2022 Projects located in designated \u201cgrowth corridors\u201d (e.g., **Neuk\u00f6lln\u2011Ost**, **Friedrichshain\u2011Kreuzberg**). | Estimated **\u20ac200\u202fk\u2013\u20ac400\u202fk** per 30\u2011unit building in saved interest and admin fees. |\n\n**Why these subsidies matter for rent\u2011control dynamics**\n\n1. **They raise the *net* return** that a developer can expect even after the rent\u2011cap is applied. A typical market\u2011rate rental project in Berlin yields a **pre\u2011tax IRR of 6\u202f%\u20137\u202f%**. After a 10\u202f% rent\u2011price brake, the IRR would fall to **\u2248\u202f3\u202f%\u20134\u202f%**, making the project unattractive. Adding a **30\u202f% grant + 20\u202f% land discount** pushes the IRR back up to **\u2248\u202f6\u202f%**, restoring commercial viability.\n\n2. **They lock a portion of the unit stock into long\u2011term affordability**, ensuring that the \u201cprice\u2011bound\u201d share does not evaporate when the unit turns over (the vacancy\u2011decontrol rule allows a rent reset, but the subsidy contract obliges the landlord to keep those units affordable for **20\u202fyears**).\n\n3. **They create a \u201cpipeline\u201d of new supply that can absorb the reduced turnover rents** of existing units, keeping the overall vacancy rate low (Berlin\u2019s vacancy rate stayed **\u2248\u202f1.4\u202f%** from 2015 to 202",
