      "truthbot_response": "**Overview**\n\nChildhood vaccines go through a multi\u2011step, science\u2011driven process before they are licensed for use, and they continue to be monitored after they enter the market.  The same rigorous framework is used worldwide (e.g., by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u202f(FDA), the European Medicines Agency\u202f(EMA), the World Health Organization\u202f(WHO), and national regulatory agencies such as Health Canada, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, etc.).  \n\nBelow is a **step\u2011by\u2011step description of how safety is evaluated**, followed by the **demonstrated benefits of vaccination**, and a **balanced look at the evidence that is sometimes cited as \u201cconcern\u201d**.  Wherever possible the strongest peer\u2011reviewed data and the consensus of major scientific bodies are highlighted, and gaps or ongoing research are noted.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Why PCV13 was developed  \n\n* **Burden of disease:** Before conjugate vaccines, >\u202f2\u202fmillion children worldwide developed severe pneumococcal disease each year, with \u2248\u202f100\u202f000 deaths (World Health Organization, 2020).  \n* **Limitations of the earlier 7\u2011valent vaccine (PCV7):** PCV7 (licensed in 2000) dramatically reduced disease caused by its 7 serotypes but left a \u201cserotype replacement\u201d gap\u2014disease caused by non\u2011covered serotypes increased.
