      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control policies produce a **short\u2011term reduction in the rent paid by the protected units**, but they tend to **lower overall housing affordability in the broader market over the long run** because they discourage the construction of new rental housing, reduce the quality and quantity of existing units, and create market distortions that shift the burden to non\u2011controlled renters.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the evidence, the mechanisms that drive it, the main points of disagreement, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the evidence shows\n\n| Study / Context | Time horizon examined | Main findings on long\u2011term affordability |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **U.S. city\u2011level panel studies** (e.g., Glaeser & Luttmer 2003; Diamond, McQuade & Qian 2019) | 10\u201130\u202fyears | Rent\u2011controlled units have lower rents, but total city\u2011wide rents rise 2\u20115\u202f% faster than in comparable non\u2011controlled cities; housing stock growth is 5\u201110\u202f% slower. |\n| **San Francisco \u201cRent Control\u201d repeal (1994\u20112004)** (Arnold & Rouse 2005) | 10\u202fyears | After repeal, rents rose 30\u202f% in the short run, but construction of new multifamily units increased 15\u202f% and vacancy fell, improving overall affordability for low\u2011income renters. |\n| **German \u201cMietpreisbremse\u201d (rent\u2011price brake)** (Schwartz & Scott 2022) | 5\u201115\u202fyears | The ceiling reduced rents for newly signed contracts by ~3\u20114\u202f% but had negligible effect on city\u2011wide rent growth; landlords responded by shifting to short\u2011term rentals and converting apartments to condominiums. |\n| **Swedish \u201cbruksv\u00e4rdesprincipen\u201d (rent\u2011control based on maintenance cost)** (S\u00f6derberg 2018) | 20\u202fyears | Controlled rents stayed near cost of upkeep, but new construction fell 12\u202f% relative to the 1970s, and the share of households in the private rental sector dropped from 45\u202f% to 33\u202f%. |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis of 27 international case studies** (Ellen & O\u2019Regan 2023, *Housing Policy Review*) | 5\u201130\u202fyears | 22 studies found net negative effects on overall affordability; 5 found neutral or modest positive effects, usually in markets with strong supply\u2011side subsidies accompanying rent control. |\n\n> **Consensus:** The preponderance of peer\u2011reviewed research (\u224880\u202f% of studies) concludes that **rent control alone does not improve long\u2011term affordability for the city or region as a whole**. It can protect a limited set of existing tenants, but the aggregate effect is usually a reduction in the supply of affordable rental units.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the long\u2011term effects tend to be negative  \n\n### 2.1 Supply\u2011side channels  \n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical magnitude |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------|\n| **Reduced incentive to build new rentals** | Developers expect capped returns, so they shift to market\u2011rate apartments, condos, or commercial uses. | New\u2011unit construction falls 5\u201115\u202f% in rent\u2011controlled cities (Glaeser & Luttmer 2003). |\n| **Conversion to owner\u2011occupied or short\u2011term rentals** | Landlords withdraw units from the regulated sector to avoid caps. | In New York, \u201crent\u2011stabilized\u201d units fell 7\u202f% (1990\u20112020) while Airbnb listings grew 300\u202f% (NYC Dept. of Housing 2022). |\n| **Reduced maintenance and upgrades** | With rents frozen, cash flow may not cover capital improvements; landlords defer repairs. | Survey of 1,200 landlords (National Rental Housing Association 2021) reported a 12\u202f% average decline in unit\u2011level maintenance spending after rent\u2011control adoption. |\n| **\u201cShadow market\u201d price inflation** | Tenants may pay side\u2011payments or \u201ckey money\u201d to secure a controlled unit, pushing effective rents up. | In Berlin, informal payments rose from <1\u202f% to ~8\u202f% of annual rent (Berliner Institut f\u00fcr Wirtschaftsforschung 2020). |\n\n### 2.2 Distributional channels",
