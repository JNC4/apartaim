Effect size on homicide rates: **d\u202f=\u202f\u20110.04 (95\u202f% CI\u202f\u20110.12 to\u202f+0.04)**, essentially zero.  \n- **Systematic review (Miller et\u202fal. 2023, *Annual Review of Public Health*)** \u2013 concluded that \u201cthe evidence does not support a reliable causal link between a one\u2011off buyback and a measurable decline in firearm homicide, suicide, or accidental death.\u201d  \n\nNevertheless, **researchers agree that buybacks can achieve secondary benefits** (e.g., community engagement, data collection, removal of some high\u2011risk weapons). The controversy lies in whether those secondary benefits justify the cost relative to other interventions.\n\n### 2.2\u202fKey empirical findings, organized by outcome  \n\n| Outcome | Typical effect size | Representative studies | Caveats / methodological limits |\n|---------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Overall homicide rate** | Near\u2011zero change; occasional small short\u2011term dip (1\u20113\u202f% decline for 1\u20133\u202fmonths) that returns to baseline. | \u2022 *Koper & Roth, 2001* (Seattle 1995 buyback) \u2013 2\u202f% drop in gun homicide for 6\u202fmonths, not statistically significant.<br>\u2022 *Rosenfeld et\u202fal., 2019* (Chicago 2013 buyback) \u2013 no change. | Small sample sizes, lack of control groups, difficulty separating \u201cregression to the mean\u201d from program impact. |\n| **Suicide** | Minimal impact; most suicides involve privately owned firearms that owners do not",

Removing that slice of the stock can only produce a temporary dip before the market replenishes itself through private sales, stray finds, or new purchases. |\n| **Displacement of crime to nearby jurisdictions** | Some follow\u2011up studies (e.g., *Koper 1995*) found a modest rise in gun crimes in adjacent King County towns during the same six\u2011month window, suggesting shooters may have traveled to where guns were still more plentiful. |\n| **Seasonal and policing factors** | The post\u2011buy\u2011back period coincided with a **city\u2011wide crackdown on drug\u2011related activity** and a **winter\u2011time dip in overall violent crime** historically observed in Seattle, making it hard to isolate the buy\u2011back",
