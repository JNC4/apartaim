      "unknown_model_response": "**How childhood vaccines are tested for safety**\n\n| Stage | What is done | Who does it & why it matters |\n|-------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| **1. Pre\u2011clinical research** | \u2022 Laboratory work to identify the antigen (protein, killed virus, mRNA, etc.)  <br>\u2022 Animal studies (usually mice, rats, sometimes non\u2011human primates) to look for immune response and any obvious toxicity. | Conducted by the vaccine developer.  This step is required before any human exposure and helps set the dose range that will be tested later. |\n| **2. Phase\u202fI clinical trials** | \u2022 20\u2011100 healthy adult volunteers (often adults because they have a more mature immune system). <br>\u2022 Primary goal: **safety** \u2013 monitor for immediate reactions, lab abnormalities, and short\u2011term side\u2011effects. <br>\u2022 Secondary goal: basic immune response. | Reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) and a national regulator (e.g., FDA, EMA, Health Canada).  The trial is closely monitored; any serious adverse event stops the study. |\n| **3. Phase\u202fII clinical trials** | \u2022 100\u2011500 participants, usually including the target age group (e.g., toddlers). <br>\u2022 Refine the dose, schedule, and route of administration. <br>\u2022 Continue safety monitoring and begin to collect **efficacy** data (does the vaccine generate protective antibodies?). | Same regulatory oversight; a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviews interim safety data. |\n| **4. Phase\u202fIII clinical trials** | \u2022 1\u202f000\u201130\u202f000 participants, randomized and blinded, often across several countries. <br>\u2022 Compare vaccine to placebo or an existing licensed vaccine. <br>\u2022 Primary outcomes: **clinical efficacy** (prevention of disease) and **rare adverse events** (e.g., events occurring in ~1\u202f/\u202f10\u202f000). | The trial must meet pre\u2011specified statistical criteria for both efficacy (usually >50\u202f% reduction in disease) and safety (no excess serious adverse events). Results are submitted to regulators for licensure. |\n| **5. Regulatory review & licensure** | \u2022 All trial data are packaged into a **Biologics License Application** (or equivalent). <br>\u2022 Regulators assess: quality of manufacturing, consistency of the product, and the benefit\u2011risk balance. | Agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), or World Health Organization (WHO) pre\u2011qualification. A vaccine is only licensed when the evidence shows that benefits outweigh risks. |\n| **6. Post\u2011licensure (Phase\u202fIV) surveillance** | \u2022 **Passive systems** (e.g., VAERS in the U.S., Yellow Card in the UK) collect any reported adverse event after the vaccine is in routine use. <br>\u2022 **Active systems** (e.g., CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, UK\u2019s Yellow Card enhanced surveillance, EU\u2019s EudraVigilance) compare rates of specific events in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations. <br>\u2022 Ongoing studies (e.g., clinical\u2011epidemiologic cohort studies) look for very rare outcomes (1\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000\u20131\u202f/\u202f1\u202f000\u202f000). | This \u201creal\u2011world\u201d monitoring can detect rare side\u2011effects that were too infrequent to appear in Phase\u202fIII. If a safety signal emerges, regulators may add warnings, restrict use, or in extremely rare cases withdraw a vaccine. |\n\n**Key points about safety testing**\n\n* **Multiple layers of oversight** \u2013 IRBs, DSMBs, and national regulatory agencies all review the data before a vaccine can be used in children.  \n* **Sample size matters** \u2013 serious adverse events that occur in",

No signal of serious toxicity was seen. |\n| **Phase\u202fI (1968\u20111970)** | \u2022 ~100 healthy adult volunteers in the United States received a single dose of the combined vaccine. | \u2022 Immediate reactions (pain, redness, fever) were recorded. <br>\u2022 Blood samples showed a rise in antibodies to all three viruses. <br>\u2022 No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. |\n| **Phase\u202fII (1970\u20111971)** | \u2022 500 children aged 12\u201115\u202fmonths were enrolled in a randomized, double\u2011blind trial in the U.K. and the U.S. <br>\u2022 Two dosing schedules were compared (one\u2011dose vs. two\u2011dose). | \u2022 Safety endpoints included fever >38.5\u202f\u00b0C, rash, seizures, and hospital admissions. <br>\u2022 Fever occurred in ~5\u202f% of children, most resolved within 24\u202fh. <br>\u2022 No cases of encephalitis or severe allergic reactions. |\n| **Phase\u202fIII (1971\u20111972)** | \u2022 >13\u202f000 children from 8 countries (U.S., U.K., Finland, Sweden, etc.) received the licensed formulation (two\u2011dose schedule at 12\u201115\u202fmonths and 4\u20116\u202fyears). <br>\u2022 The trial was double\u2011blind and compared MMR to separate measles\u2011only vaccine plus placebo injections. | \u2022 Primary safety outcome: incidence of serious adverse events within 42\u202fdays of vaccination. <br>\u2022 SAEs occurred at the same rate as the control group (\u22480.02\u202f%). <br>\u2022 Efficacy: >95\u202f% seroconversion for measles, >90\u202f% for mumps and rubella after the first dose; >99\u202f% after the second. |\n| **Regulatory licensure (1971\u20111972)** | \u2022 The U.S. FDA, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the WHO\u2019s Expert Committee reviewed the data. <br>\u2022 The vaccine was granted licensure in the U.S. (1971) and in many other countries shortly thereafter. | \u2022 The licensing decision was based on a clear benefit\u2011risk ratio: very high protection against three potentially severe diseases and a low rate of mild, short\u2011lived side\u2011effects. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure (Phase\u202fIV) surveillance** | **a. Passive reporting systems** \u2013 VAERS (U.S., started 1990), the U.K.\u2019s Yellow Card Scheme (1975), and similar databases worldwide collect any adverse event reported after vaccination. <br>**b. Active cohort studies** \u2013 CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD, 1990\u2011present) follows >9\u202fmillion people in real\u2011time electronic health records. <br>**c. Large\u2011scale epidemiologic studies** \u2013 e.g., the Danish National Cohort (\u22481\u202fmillion children) and the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). | **Key safety findings over the past 50\u202f+\u202fyears** |\n| | \u2022 **Fever & febrile seizures** \u2013 About 5\u201110\u202f% of children develop a fever 5\u201112\u202fdays after the first dose; febrile seizures occur in \u22481 per 3\u202f000 doses. This risk is considered *very low* and is mitigated by giving the vaccine at 12\u201115\u202fmonths (when the brain is less seizure\u2011prone) and by informing parents. | \u2022 **Aseptic meningitis** \u2013 Early formulations of the mumps component (derived from the Jeryl\u2011Lynn",

Maternal antibodies wane around 6\u201312\u202fmonths\n* Newborns receive measles\u2011specific IgG that can neutralize the vaccine virus if given too early.  \n* Studies measuring antibody titres show a steep decline after 6\u202fmonths, with most infants having <\u202f200\u202fmIU/mL (the level considered \u201cinterfering\u201d) by 12\u202fmonths.  \n* Giving the vaccine after this point maximizes seroconversion rates (\u224893\u202f% for measles after one dose vs. \u224870\u202f% if given at 9\u202fmonths).\n\n### 2. Primary immune response peaks after the first dose\n* After the 12\u2011month dose, the body produces memory B\u2011cells and T\u2011cells.  \n* For the small subset that does not reach protective titres (\u22485\u202f% for measles, somewhat higher for mumps), the immune system is already \u201cprimed,\u201d so the second dose elicits a **rapid, high\u2011titer** response\u2014",
