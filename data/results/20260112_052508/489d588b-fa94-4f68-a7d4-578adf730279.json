Some heat\u2011resistant spores may survive but are usually far below infectious doses. |\n| **Key hazards identified by public\u2011health agencies** | \u2022 **Bacterial pathogens** \u2013 outbreaks of *Salmonella* (e.g., 2018\u20112020 outbreaks linked to raw milk in the U.S.), *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*.<br>\u2022 **Viral or parasitic agents** \u2013 rare but possible (e.g., hepatitis A, Cryptosporidium).<br>\u2022 **Antibiotic\u2011resistant bacteria** \u2013 raw milk can carry resistant strains from dairy cows treated with antibiotics. | \u2022 **Residual heat\u2011stable toxins** \u2013 if milk was contaminated before pasteurization, some toxins (e.g., staphylococcal enterotoxin) can survive, but the bacteria that produced them are killed.<br>\u2022 **Spoilage** \u2013 longer shelf\u2011life reduces the chance of post\u2011pasteurization contamination. |\n| **Incidence of food\u2011borne illness** (U.S. data, CDC & FDA) | \u2022 From 1993\u20112012, **\u22485\u202f%** of all reported milk\u2011related outbreaks involved raw milk, but they accounted for **\u224830\u202f%** of the *illnesses* and **\u224850\u202f%** of the *hospitalizations* from milk\u2011borne disease (CDC, 2013).<br>\u2022 Average of **\u22481\u20132 outbreaks per year** nationally, each affecting dozens to hundreds of people. | \u2022 Pasteurized milk is implicated in **<0.1\u202f%** of milk\u2011related outbreaks in the same period; most cases are due to post\u2011pasteurization contamination (e.g., from equipment or handlers).<br>\u2022 In the U.K., Food Standards Agency (2021) recorded **zero** confirmed outbreaks directly linked to commercial pasteurized milk over a 5\u2011year span. |\n| **Severity of illness** | Higher proportion of severe outcomes (hospitalization, ICU, death) especially for vulnerable groups (young children, elderly, pregnant women, immunocompromised). | When illness occurs, it is usually milder (often gastroenteritis from other foods) because the milk itself rarely carries live pathogens. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme differences** (often cited by raw\u2011milk advocates) | \u2022 Slightly higher levels of certain heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (B\u2011complex, vitamin\u202fC) \u2013 differences are usually **<5\u202f%** of daily values.<br>\u2022 Presence of native enzymes (e.g., lipase, lactoperoxidase) and \u201cprobiotic\u201d bacteria. | \u2022 Minimal loss of nutrients; most vitamins and proteins remain intact after HTST. <br>\u2022 Enzymes are largely inactivated, which actually **extends shelf life** and reduces risk of off\u2011flavors. |\n| **Regulatory stance (selected countries)** | \u2022 **U.S.** \u2013 FDA prohibits interstate sale of raw milk; some states allow limited farm\u2011gate sales with strict testing.<br>\u2022 **Canada** \u2013 Sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal nationwide.<br>\u2022 **EU** \u2013 Allowed in many member states but must meet strict microbiological criteria and be clearly labeled \u201craw milk \u2013 may contain harmful bacteria.\u201d | \u2022 Universally allowed; must meet *Pasteurized Milk Ordinance* (U.S.) or equivalent standards for bacterial counts, somatic cell count, and absence of pathogens. |\n| **Mitigation",

The farm also supplied raw milk to a local \u201craw\u2011milk bar\u201d that made smoothies. |\n| **How the contamination occurred** | \u2022 **Fecal contamination of the udder** \u2013 a cow with a sub\u2011clinical mastitis infection shed _E.\u202fcoli_ in the milk.<br>\u2022 **Inadequate cleaning of the milking equipment** \u2013 the bulk\u2011tank and hoses were rinsed with water only; no sanitizing solution was used between milking sessions.<br>\u2022 **No post\u2011milking pathogen testing** \u2013 the farm relied on a quarterly bacterial\u2011count test (which the farm passed) but did not test for specific pathogens. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 Recall of all raw\u2011milk containers from the farm and the smoothie shop.<br>\u2022 Temporary shutdown of the farm\u2019s raw\u2011milk sales pending corrective\u2011action plan.<br>\u2022 Advisory issued by the CDC warning consumers about the risks of raw milk and reminding clinicians to ask patients about raw\u2011milk exposure when evaluating diarrheal illness. |\n| **Key lesson from the investigation** | Even a single infected animal can contaminate an entire bulk\u2011tank of milk.

Strict herd health management** | \u2022 Vaccinate cows against common mastitis pathogens (e.g., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus uberis_).<br>\u2022 Test all lactating cows quarterly for _E.\u202fcoli_, _Salmonella_, and _Listeria_ using milk\u2011culture or PCR.<br>\u2022 Cull or treat any animal that tests positive. | Reduces the *source* of contamination. | 30\u201150\u202f% |\n| **2. Hygienic milking environment** | \u2022 Clean and sanitize all milking equipment (buckets, hoses, bulk\u2011tank interior) after each milking session with an approved sanitizer (e.g., peracetic acid at 200\u202fppm).<br>\u2022 Use a pre\u2011milking udder wash with an approved antimicrobial solution (e.g., chlorhexidine 0.5\u202f%). | Removes bacteria on the udder and on surfaces that would otherwise be transferred to the milk. | 40\u201160\u202f% |\n| **3.

How pasteurization kills the microbes that make raw milk dangerous  \n\n| Step | What actually happens to the bacteria (and to the milk) | Why it matters for safety |\n|------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **a. Heating to a specific temperature** | *Thermal death* is a kinetic process. Every micro\u2011organism has a **D\u2011value** \u2013 the time required at a given temperature to reduce its population by one log (\u201190\u202f% of the cells). For the pathogens most often found in milk: <br>\u2022 _E.\u202fcoli_ O157:H7\u202f: D\u2087\u2082\u00b0C \u2248\u202f0.2\u202fs <br>\u2022 _Salmonella_ spp.\u202f: D\u2087\u2082\u00b0C \u2248\u202f0.3\u202fs <br>\u2022 _Listeria monocytogenes_\u202f: D\u2087\u2082\u00b0C \u2248\u202f0.4\u202fs <br>\u2022 _Campylobacter jejuni_\u202f: D\u2087\u2082\u00b0C \u2248\u202f0.1\u202fs | By holding the milk at the target temperature for a time that is many multiples of the D\u2011value (the \u201clog\u2011reduction\u201d goal), almost every viable cell is destroyed. |\n| **b. Time\u2011temperature combinations (the \u201ckill step\u201d)** | **Common commercial regimes**  <br>\u2022 **HTST (high\u2011temperature short\u2011time)** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (\u2248\u202f5\u20136 log\u2011reduction for the above pathogens).  <br>\u2022 **Holder (low\u2011temperature long\u2011time)** \u2013 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin (\u2248\u202f5\u20136 log\u2011reduction).  <br>\u2022 **UHT (ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature)** \u2013 135\u202f\u00b0C (275\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fs (\u2265\u202f6\u2011log reduction; also inactivates most spores). | The longer the exposure relative to the D\u2011value, the fewer survivors. A 5\u2011log reduction means 1 cell in 100\u202f000 is left; a 6\u2011log reduction means 1 in 1\u202f000\u202f000. For a typical raw\u2011milk batch that might contain 10\u2074\u201310\u2076 CFU of a pathogen, a 5\u2011log kill brings the count well below the infectious dose for healthy adults. |\n| **c. Protein denaturation & enzyme inactivation** | Heat also unfolds milk proteins (\u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin, caseins) and destroys enzymes such as lipase and lactoperoxidase. This does **not** directly kill bacteria, but it **prevents the bacteria from repairing damage** and stops the growth of any survivors that might have been heat\u2011resistant. | Adds a safety \u201cbuffer\u201d \u2013 even if a few hardy cells survive, they find an environment that no longer supports rapid multiplication. |\n| **d. Rapid cooling** | After the hold, milk is quickly chilled to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C. Cooling stops any residual enzymatic activity and halts bacterial growth. | Guarantees that any (unlikely) survivors stay at a level that never reaches a dose capable of causing disease. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Pasteurization works because heat denatures essential cellular components (membranes, enzymes, nucleic acids) faster than the microbes can repair them, and the time\u2011temperature regimen is chosen to give a >5\u2011log reduction for the most heat\u2011resistant milk\u2011borne pathogens.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  \u201cSafe\u201d ways to enjoy raw\u2011style milk when someone still wants it  \n\n| Option | How it is done | What risk it removes | Residual risk (approx.) | Practicality & notes |\n|--------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **A.
