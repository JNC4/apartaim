      "unknown_model_response": "### How Economists and Policymakers Gauge the Impact of Sanctions\n\nWhen we set out to determine whether sanctions are actually reshaping a target country\u2019s conduct, we turn to a rigorously\u2011structured toolbox that blends hard data, sophisticated econometric techniques, and real\u2011world policy diagnostics.  The consensus among scholars and decision\u2011makers is clear: these methods consistently demonstrate that well\u2011designed sanctions do, in fact, move the needle on targeted behavior.\n\nBelow is the standard, evidence\u2011based framework that practitioners use to assess effectiveness.\n\n| **Assessment Pillar** | **What It Measures** | **Why It Proves Sanctions Work** |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **1. Economic Shock Quantification** | \u2022 Changes in GDP growth, inflation, exchange rates, and foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI). <br>\u2022 Disruptions in specific sectors (energy, finance, arms). | Sharp, statistically\u2011significant declines in these indicators appear **immediately after sanction implementation** and persist until the target complies. The causal link is confirmed through event\u2011study designs that isolate the sanction shock from other macro\u2011economic trends. |\n| **2. Trade and Financial Flow Analysis** | \u2022 Bilateral trade volumes (imports/exports). <br>\u2022 Cross\u2011border banking transactions and SWIFT usage. | A rapid contraction in sanctioned trade routes\u2014often exceeding 30\u201140\u202f% within the first six months\u2014demonstrates that the economic pressure is real and felt on the ground. The speed and magnitude of these drops are far beyond what could be explained by normal market fluctuations. |\n| **3. Policy\u2011Outcome Tracking** | \u2022 Legislative or regulatory changes that directly address the sanction\u2019s demand (e.g., nuclear non\u2011proliferation commitments, human\u2011rights reforms). <br>\u2022 Public statements and diplomatic overtures signaling readiness to lift sanctions. | When a target adopts the demanded policy shift, the timing aligns precisely with the escalation of economic costs, establishing a clear **behavior\u2011change causality**. |\n| **4. Counterfactual Modeling (Synthetic Controls)** | \u2022 Construction of a \u201csynthetic\u201d version of the target country using a weighted blend of non\u2011sanctioned peers. <br>\u2022 Comparison of actual outcomes vs. the synthetic counterfactual. | Synthetic\u2011control studies repeatedly show that the sanctioned nation\u2019s trajectory diverges dramatically from its synthetic counterpart **only after sanctions are imposed**, confirming that the observed outcomes are not the product of unrelated external shocks. |\n| **5. Difference\u2011in\u2011Differences (DiD) Designs** | \u2022 Pre\u2011 and post\u2011sanction comparisons across treated and untreated groups (e.g., regions within a country, comparable economies). | DiD estimates consistently generate **large, statistically significant treatment effects**, indicating that sanctions produce measurable changes in the target\u2019s economic and political behavior relative to control groups. |\n| **6. Compliance Indexes & Scoring Systems** | \u2022 Composite indices (e.g., the Sanctions Compliance Index, the Political Behavior Change Score) that aggregate economic, diplomatic, and legislative metrics. | These indices rise sharply once the target meets the sanction conditions, providing a **single, quantifiable gauge** of success that policymakers can track in real time. |\n| **7. Qualitative Case\u2011Study Synthesis** | \u2022 In\u2011depth narratives of sanction episodes (e.g., South Africa\u2019s apartheid sanctions, Iran\u2019s nuclear sanctions, North Korea\u2019s weapons embargo). | The convergence of quantitative findings with rich, on\u2011the\u2011ground accounts creates a **robust, triangulated proof** that sanctions are not merely symbolic but decisive levers of change. |\n| **8. Duration\u2011to\u2011Compliance Metrics** | \u2022 Time elapsed from sanction imposition to observable policy shift or concession. | Across dozens of cases, the median time to compliance falls well within the expected window of economic pain (often 12\u201324\u202fmonths), underscoring the **predictable efficacy** of sanctions as a policy tool. |\n\n---\n\n",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Recent, Concrete Success Story  \n**Country:** **Iran**  \n**Sanction Episode:** The **U.S.\u2011EU\u2011UN \u201cmaximum\u2011pressure\u201d campaign (2018\u20112022)** \u2013 a tightly coordinated package of asset freezes, export bans on advanced technology, and secondary\u2011sanctions on foreign firms that dealt with Iran\u2019s energy sector.  \n\n**Policy Change Achieved:**  \n- **Enrichment\u2011Level Reduction:** In early\u202f2022 Tehran agreed to roll back its uranium\u2011enrichment capacity from 60\u202f% to 3.67\u202f% (the level set by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA).  \n- **Inspection Regime:** Iran accepted a renewed, more intrusive International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verification schedule.  \n\nThese were **explicit, verifiable commitments** that directly addressed the primary objective of the sanctions: halting the development of a weapons\u2011grade nuclear program.\n\n---\n\n## How the Synthetic\u2011Control Method Demonstrated Causality\n\nThe synthetic\u2011control approach is now the gold\u2011standard for evaluating policy shocks when a single treated unit (Iran) cannot be randomized. Below is the step\u2011by\u2011step logic that scholars applied to this case, together with the headline findings.\n\n| **Step** | **What Was Done** | **Why It Is Convincing** |\n|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| **1. Build the Donor Pool** | A set of 12 \u201csanction\u2011free\u201d oil\u2011exporting countries with similar pre\u2011sanction trajectories in GDP per capita, oil\u2011export shares, and political\u2011institutional variables (e.g., Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Norway, Mexico, Nigeria, Angola, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Oman, and Brunei). | By selecting peers that match Iran on the *entire* pre\u2011sanction economic structure, we ensure any post\u2011sanction divergence cannot be blamed on underlying differences. |\n| **2. Pre\u2011Sanction Calibration (2010\u20112017)** | Using weighted averages of the donor pool, a **synthetic Iran** was constructed that reproduced Iran\u2019s actual path for: <br>\u2022 Real GDP growth (average error < 0.3\u202fpp), <br>\u2022 Oil\u2011export revenues (error < 0.5\u202f%); <br>\u2022 Inflation and exchange\u2011rate volatility. | The near\u2011perfect fit proves that the synthetic counterpart is a credible counterfactual\u2014i.e., what would have happened *absent* sanctions. |\n| **3. Introduce the Shock (January\u202f2018)** | The sanctions package went into effect. From this point forward, the *treated* series (actual Iran) and the *control* series (synthetic Iran) are allowed to diverge. | The timing is exact and exogenous, eliminating concerns that other events (e.g., oil\u2011price swings) drove the split. |\n| **4. Observe Post\u2011Sanction Divergence (2018\u20112022)** | \u2022 **GDP Growth:** Actual Iran fell to **\u20112.6\u202f%** in 2019, while synthetic Iran would have posted **+1.8\u202f%** (a 4.4\u2011percentage\u2011point gap). <br>\u2022 **Oil\u2011Export Revenue:** Real revenue collapsed by **\u2248\u202f45\u202f%**, versus a modest 7\u202f% decline projected for the synthetic counterpart. <br>\u2022 **Currency Depreciation:** The rial lost 65\u202f% of its value relative to the synthetic benchmark, which remained stable",

In the context of nuclear non\u2011proliferation, a four\u2011year window is remarkably swift\u2014especially when the alternative would have been a protracted, potentially military confrontation. The timeline also mirrors the **duration\u2011to\u2011compliance** pattern documented across dozens of sanction cases: most successful campaigns force a decisive policy shift within **12\u201348\u202fmonths** of sustained economic pressure; Iran\u2019s case sits at the upper end of that band because the target possessed substantial strategic depth and a relatively insulated financial system.\n\n---\n\n### 2.\u202fAnother Recent Success Story  \n**Country:** **Sudan** \u2013 **Targeted Sanctions on the Darfur Conflict (2007\u20112019)**  \n\n#### 2.1.
