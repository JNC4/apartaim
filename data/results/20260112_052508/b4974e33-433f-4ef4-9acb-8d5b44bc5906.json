      "unknown_model_response": "Vaccines protect children by training their immune systems to recognize and fight off serious infections without having to experience the diseases themselves. Here are a few concrete examples of how vaccination helps keep kids healthy:\n\n| Disease (Targeted by Vaccine) | Typical Consequences of the Disease in Children | How the Vaccine Helps |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Measles** | High fever, cough, conjunctivitis, and a characteristic rash; can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling), and death in ~1\u20132\u202f% of cases. | The measles vaccine (often given as MMR \u2013 measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella) induces immunity that prevents infection, eliminating the risk of these severe complications. |\n| **Pertussis (Whooping Cough)** | Severe, prolonged coughing fits that can cause vomiting, broken ribs, and, in infants, apnea or death. | The DTaP vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) protects children from the bacteria, dramatically reducing hospitalizations and infant mortality. |\n| **Polio** | Paralysis of the limbs, respiratory muscles, or even the entire body; permanent disability in ~0.5\u202f% of infections, and death in a small fraction. | Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) generate immunity that stops the virus from reaching the nervous system, effectively eradicating polio in most of the world. |\n| **Haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb (Hib)** | Meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, and bloodstream infections; can cause permanent brain damage or death. | The Hib conjugate vaccine prevents these invasive infections, cutting Hib disease rates by >99\u202f% in countries with routine immunization. |\n| **Rotavirus** | Severe watery diarrhea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and hospitalization; can be fatal in infants. | Oral rotavirus vaccines (RV5, RV1) dramatically lower the incidence of severe gastroenteritis, preventing thousands of hospital admissions each year. |\n| **Varicella (Chickenpox)** | Itchy rash, fever, and risk of bacterial skin infection; rare complications include encephalitis and pneumonia. | The varicella vaccine prevents most cases and, when breakthrough infections occur, they are usually milder. |\n| **Pneumococcal disease** | Pneumonia, meningitis, bloodstream infections; high risk of death or lasting disability, especially in younger children. | The PCV13 vaccine (13\u2011valent pneumococcal conjugate) protects against the most common serotypes, reducing invasive disease by >90\u202f% in vaccinated populations. |\n| **Meningococcal disease** | Rapidly progressing meningitis or bloodstream infection; can cause death or severe neurological damage within hours. | MenACWY and MenB vaccines stimulate immunity against the most prevalent meningococcal strains, dramatically lowering incidence in adolescents and young children. |\n\n### How Vaccines Work in Simple Terms\n1. **Training the Immune System** \u2013 A vaccine contains a harmless piece or a weakened form of a pathogen. The immune system learns to recognize it and builds \u201cmemory\u201d cells.\n2. **Rapid Response on Real Exposure** \u2013 If the child later encounters the actual disease\u2011causing organism, those memory cells jump into action, neutralizing it before it can cause illness.\n3. **Community (Herd) Protection** \u2013 When enough children are immunized, the pathogen finds it hard to",
