      "unknown_model_response": "**Bottom line:**  \nPasteurization is a heat\u2011treatment that reliably kills or inactivates the bacteria that cause most milk\u2011borne food\u2011borne illnesses.  Raw (un\u2011heated) milk can contain those same bacteria, so the risk of infection is higher, especially for people with weakened immune systems.  The nutritional differences between the two are relatively small and do not outweigh the safety benefit for most consumers.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based comparison of the two products.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

In the EU, raw milk can be sold only if it meets stringent microbiological limits and is clearly labeled. | Universally permitted; required to meet microbiological standards (e.g., <10\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 coliforms in the U.S., <5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 in the EU). |\n\n**Why pasteurization works**  \n- **HTST (high\u2011temperature short\u2011time)**: 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2192 \u22655\u202flog reduction of *C. perfringens* spores, >6\u202flog reduction of *E. coli* O157:H7.  \n- **UHT (ultra\u2011high temperature)**: 135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20134\u202fs \u2192 commercial sterility (no viable microbes for 6\u202fmonths unopened).  \n\nEven the milder HTST step eliminates the most common milk\u2011borne pathogens, and the process is validated by rigorous industry standards (e.g., ISO\u202f22000, USDA FSIS).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

No other common food or water sources were identified. |\n| **Investigation** | *   The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) collected unopened milk bottles from the farm\u2019s inventory and performed **culture and PCR** testing.  <br>*   *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 was isolated from three separate milk containers, matching the patient isolates by whole\u2011genome sequencing (\u2264\u202f2\u202fSNP differences).  <br>*   The farm\u2019s herd health records showed a recent mastitis case in a goat that had been co\u2011housed with the dairy cows; the goat later tested positive for the same strain, suggesting a possible animal\u2011source reservoir. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 Immediate **voluntary recall** of all raw milk from the farm.  <br>\u2022 **Cease\u2011sale order** issued by the Texas **Department of Agriculture**; the farm was barred from selling raw milk until corrective actions (herd\u2011health plan, stricter sanitation, and a 30\u2011day \u201ctest\u2011and\u2011hold\u201d period) were verified.  <br>\u2022 CDC issued an **EFSA\u2011style \u201calert\u201d** to health\u2011care providers in neighboring states, reminding them to ask about raw\u2011milk consumption when evaluating patients with bloody diarrhea. |\n| **Outcome for the farm** | After the recall, the dairy applied for a **\u201craw\u2011milk exemption\u201d** under Texas law.  The exemption was denied because the investigation demonstrated a clear breach of the state\u2019s microbial\u2011limit requirements (\u2265\u202f10\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 coliforms in the milk sample).  The farm later switched to **pasteurised milk** for on\u2011site sales. |\n\n#### Why this outbreak matters\n\n1. **Pathogen potency** \u2013 *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 produces Shiga toxin; even a small inoculum (\u2248\u202f10\u2013100\u202fCFU) can cause severe gastrointestinal illness, HUS, or death, especially in children and the elderly.  \n2. **Direct link to raw milk** \u2013 Whole\u2011genome sequencing showed the isolates from patients and from the milk were virtually identical, leaving little doubt that the milk was the source.  \n3. **Scale relative to pasteurised\u2011milk outbreaks** \u2013 In the same 12\u2011month period (mid\u20112022\u202f\u2013\u202fmid\u20112023) the CDC recorded **only 2** outbreaks linked to pasteurised milk (both limited to <\u202f10 cases each).

Stool cultures grew *C.\u202fjejuni* with identical pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, indicating a common source. |\n| **Hypothesis generation** | An initial interview questionnaire asked about recent food exposures (undercooked poultry, unpasteurised dairy, water, travel).  21 of the 23 patients reported having consumed raw milk from the same farm within the prior 7\u202fdays. | The two patients who denied raw\u2011milk consumption had eaten food prepared in the same household (e.g., a casserole) that also contained the milk, confirming secondary exposure. |\n| **Environmental testing** | NYSDOH, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), and the farm\u2019s own laboratory collected 12 samples: 8 from bulk tank milk, 2 from the milking line, 2 from the farm\u2019s water source. | 7 of the 8 milk samples were positive for *C.\u202fjejuni* (\u2248\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9).

When a protein denatures it can no longer catalyse essential reactions (e.g., DNA replication, ATP synthesis) or maintain the cell\u2019s shape.  The loss of enzyme activity is usually irreversible once the temperature stays above the denaturation point for a few seconds. |\n| **Membrane fluidisation & rupture** | The phospholipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane becomes more fluid as temperature rises.  At 60\u201170\u202f\u00b0C the membrane\u2019s integrity is compromised: phospholipids become disordered, and the membrane can leak ions and small molecules.  Leakage collapses the proton\u2011motive force, stops ATP generation, and ultimately leads to cell lysis. |\n| **Nucleic\u2011acid damage** | Heat can cause depurination and strand breaks in DNA, especially when combined with the oxidative stress that occurs in a heated milk matrix (presence of dissolved oxygen, metal ions).  Even if a cell survives the protein/ membrane assault, a damaged genome prevents replication. |\n| **Thermal death time (TDT) curves** | For each organism scientists have measured a **D\u2011value** \u2013 the time (in seconds) at a given temperature required to reduce the viable count by one log (90\u202f%).  For example, *Salmonella enterica* in milk has a D\u2011value of ~1\u202fs at 72\u202f\u00b0C, meaning that a 15\u2011second HTST hold gives a >\u202f14\u2011log kill (far beyond the 5\u2011log reduction required by regulations).  Heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Bacillus cereus*) have D\u2011values of several minutes at 72\u202f\u00b0C, which is why pasteurisation does **not** aim to sterilise but to reduce vegetative pathogens to a level that the cold chain can keep safe. |\n| **Heat\u2011labile toxins** | Some pathogens (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*) produce toxins that are stable to pasteurisation.  That is why the regulatory focus is on **preventing** the bacteria from reaching toxin\u2011producing numbers **before** pasteurisation (through herd health, milking hygiene, rapid cooling).  If the milk is already heavily contaminated, pasteurisation alone may not eliminate the toxin. |\n\n### Bottom\u2011line mechanistic picture  \n\n1. **Rapid temperature rise** \u2192 proteins unfold, membranes become leaky.  \n2. **Sustained exposure (seconds to minutes)** \u2192 cumulative damage overwhelms repair mechanisms; most cells cannot re\u2011fold proteins or reseal membranes.  \n3. **Cooling** \u2192 any surviving cells are now far fewer; if the milk is kept at \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C the remaining vegetative cells (if any) cannot multiply, and spores remain dormant.\n\n---\n\n## A \u201creal\u2011world\u201d snapshot of how a typical commercial dairy carries out pasteurisation  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step description of a **high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurisation line** that processes ~\u202f10\u202f000\u202fL\u202fh\u207b\u00b9, which is common for a regional dairy that supplies supermarkets and food\u2011service customers.  Numbers are illustrative; actual values vary by plant design, local regulations, and product specifications (e.g., whole\u2011milk vs. skim).\n\n| Step | Equipment & operating parameters | Purpose / quality control |\n|------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **1. Receiving & pre\u2011cooling** | Raw milk is pumped from bulk storage tanks into a **plate heat\u2011exchanger pre\u2011cooler** that brings the temperature down to ~\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C (or \u2264\u202f6\u202f\u00b0C) before it enters the pasteuriser. | Removes heat generated during transport, limits bacterial growth, and protects downstream equipment from overheating. |\n| **2. Filtration** | **Micro\u2011filter (0.2\u202f\u00b5m)** or **coarse screen (\u2248\u202f100\u202f\u00b5m)** removes large debris, somatic cells, and some bacteria. | Improves heat\u2011transfer efficiency and reduces fouling of the pasteuriser. |\n| **3. Heat\u2011exchange (first side)** | Milk passes through a **counter\u2011flow plate heat\u2011exchanger** where it is heated by hot water/",
