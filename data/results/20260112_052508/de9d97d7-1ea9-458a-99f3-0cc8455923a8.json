      "unknown_model_response": "**The American Civil War (1861\u20111865) was the result of a web of inter\u2011related political, economic, social, and cultural forces.  Historians today agree that the institution of slavery was the central, \u201cprimary cause,\u201d but they also recognize a set of complementary factors that made the conflict almost inevitable.  Below is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the most important drivers, together with the scholarly consensus and the points on which historians still debate.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Slavery \u2013 the Core Issue  \n\n| Aspect | What happened | Why it mattered |\n|--------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Economic foundation** | The Southern economy was built on a plantation system that relied on enslaved labor to produce cotton, tobacco, rice, and later sugar. By 1860, 4\u202fmillion enslaved people supplied roughly 60\u202f% of U.S. cotton exports, which accounted for about 50\u202f% of the nation\u2019s foreign trade revenue. | The \u201cCotton Kingdom\u201d created a powerful Southern elite that defended slavery as essential to its wealth and way of life. |\n| **Moral\u2011political conflict** | Abolitionist movements (e.g., American Anti\u2011Slavery Society, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin* 1852) made slavery a national moral issue. The Republican Party (founded 1854) adopted a platform of \u201cpreventing the spread of slavery\u201d into the territories. | The moral debate turned into a political battle over whether the Union could continue while a large portion of its population owned human beings. |\n| **Legal\u2011constitutional disputes** | The Constitution left the regulation of slavery largely to the states, but several federal actions (Missouri Compromise 1820, Compromise of 1850, Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act 1854, Dred Scott v.\u202fMadison 1857) repeatedly raised the question of where slavery could expand. | Each compromise temporarily eased tensions but also exposed how deeply the nation was divided over the \u201cslavery question.\u201d |\n\n**Scholarly consensus:**  Most historians (e.g., James McPherson, Eric Foner, David Blight) label slavery as *the primary cause* of the war.  The \u201csectional\u201d nature of the conflict\u2014North vs. South\u2014was essentially a conflict over the future of slavery.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Sectional Economic Differences  \n\n| Region | Economic structure | Political stance on slavery |\n|--------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| **North (industrial & diversified agriculture)** | Manufacturing, railroads, small farms, banking, growing immigrant labor force. | Generally opposed to the expansion of slavery for economic competition reasons; many were \u201cfree\u2011soil\u201d rather than abolitionist. |\n| **South (plantation\u2011based, export\u2011oriented)** | Large cash\u2011crop plantations, little industrial base, reliance on slave labor. | Defended slavery as indispensable to their economic survival and political power. |\n\n**Why it mattered:**  The North\u2019s push for protective tariffs, internal improvements, and a national banking system threatened Southern economic interests, while Southern demands for cheap cotton markets and low tariffs threatened Northern industrialists.  These competing economic visions deepened mistrust and reinforced sectional identities.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Political Compromises and Their Collapse  \n\n1. **Missouri Compromise (1820)** \u2013 Established a line (36\u00b030\u2032) limiting slavery\u2019s expansion.  \n2. **Compromise of 1850** \u2013 Admitted California as free, strengthened Fugitive\u2011Slave Act, allowed territories to decide by popular sovereignty.  \n3. **Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act (1854)** \u2013 Repealed the Missouri line, leading to \u201cBleeding Kansas,\u201d a violent showdown over whether the new territories would be free or slave.  \n\n**Outcome:**  Each compromise was a temporary band\u2011age; they exposed the inability of Congress to find a lasting solution.  The repeated \u201cre\u2011opening\u201d of the slavery question eroded faith in political negotiation and made war appear inevitable.\n\n---\n\n## 4. \u201cStates\u2019 Rights\u201d vs. Federal Authority  \n\n*What the phrase means:*  Southern leaders argued that each state retained the right to determine its own laws about slavery and other matters, invoking the Tenth Amendment and the doctrine of *nullification* (e.g., South Carolina\u2019s 1832 and 1850 \u201cnullification\u201d crises).  \n\n*Why it mattered:*  The \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d rhetoric was largely a *defense of slavery*; however, it also",

While later Southern rhetoric sometimes emphasized \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d or \u201ceconomic grievances,\u201d the primary documents make it unmistakably clear that the protection of the slave system was the immediate and primary cause.",
