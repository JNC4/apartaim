A government agency, police department, or nonprofit advertises a \u201cbuy\u2011back\u201d (often with a set date and location). <br>2. Owners bring guns (usually only legal, hand\u2011held firearms) to a collection site. <br>3. The gun is turned over to authorities and the participant receives a cash payment, gift card, or voucher. | \u2022\u202fNo\u2011questions\u2011asked surrender (often \u201camnesty\u201d for weapons that would otherwise be illegal to possess). <br>\u2022\u202fPayments range from **$50\u2013$500 per weapon** in U.S. city programs; national programs can pay more for certain types (e.g., Australia paid AU$1,000 for semi\u2011automatic rifles). <br>\u2022\u202fCollected firearms are destroyed, stored, or sometimes transferred to law\u2011enforcement evidence. <br>\u2022\u202fPrograms may be one\u2011off events, recurring \u201cmonthly/quarterly\u201d drives, or continuous \u201cexchange kiosks.\u201d |\n| **Funding** | \u2022\u202fLocal or state budgets (often a few hundred thousand dollars for a city\u2011wide event). <br>\u2022\u202fFederal grants (e.g., U.S. DOJ\u2019s *Community Oriented Policing Services* grant). <br>\u2022\u202fPrivate philanthropy or corporate sponsorship. |\n| **Eligibility** | \u2022\u202fLegal owners who can prove ownership (often not required). <br>\u2022\u202fSome programs restrict to **hand\u2011guns only**; others accept rifles/shotguns. <br>\u2022\u202fIn many U.S. cities, participants must be residents of the jurisdiction. |\n| **Legal context** | \u2022\u202fIn the U.S., most programs are \u201camnesty\u201d \u2013 participants are not prosecuted for possessing the gun, even if it was previously illegal. <br>\u2022\u202fIn countries with stricter gun laws (Australia, New\u202fZealand, Canada, the UK), buy\u2011backs are part of broader legislative reforms and may target *specific* classes of weapons. |\n\n---\n\n## What the research says\n\n### 1.

(U.S.)** | 2013\u20112015 (annual) | ~6,200 guns total | $50\u2011$150 vouchers; 70\u202f% hand\u2011guns. |\n| **Toronto, Canada (2006\u20112015)** | 10\u2011year program | ~7,500 firearms | $5\u2011$100 vouchers; included rifles/shotguns. |\n| **New\u202fZealand (2019 post\u2011Christchurch)** | 2\u202fmonths | ~56,000 firearms (\u2248 5\u202f% of civilian stock) | $100 per rifle/shotgun, $250 for semi\u2011automatics. |\n\n*Take\u2011away*: Buy\u2011backs can pull **hundreds to tens of thousands** of weapons out of circulation, but the proportion of the total civilian gun supply is usually **small** (often <\u202f5\u202f%).  \n\n---\n\n### 2.

The NFA banned semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns, and pump\u2011action shotguns, and required a **mandatory, government\u2011funded buy\u2011back** of those prohibited weapons. |\n| **Scope of the buy\u2011back** | ~\u202f650\u202f000 firearms (\u2248\u202f1\u202f% of the estimated 65\u202fmillion civilian guns) were surrendered voluntarily for cash compensation (AU$1\u202f000 for each prohibited rifle/shotgun, AU$500 for each prohibited handgun). |\n| **Time frame** | The buy\u2011back ran from **July\u202f1996 to August\u202f1998** (\u2248\u202f14\u202fmonths). |\n| **Key outcome measures studied** | \u2022 Homicide rates (overall and firearm\u2011specific). <br>\u2022 Suicide rates (firearm\u2011related). <br>\u2022 Non\u2011fatal firearm injuries. |\n| **Main peer\u2011reviewed findings** | 1. **Overall homicide** fell from **1.54 per 100\u202f000 in 1995** to **1.15 per 100\u202f000 in 2001** \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f25\u202f% decline**. <br>2. **Firearm\u2011related homicide** fell from **0.40 to 0.17 per 100\u202f000** \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f57\u202f% decline**. <br>3. The decline began **immediately after the legislation** and continued steadily through the 2000s. <br>4. When researchers controlled for secular trends (overall crime decline, economic factors, policing changes), the *additional* effect attributable specifically to the NFA/buy\u2011back was estimated at **\u20110.08 to \u20110.12 firearm\u2011homicides per 100\u202f000 per year** (roughly a 15\u201320\u202f% reduction beyond the background trend). |\n| **Key studies** | \u2022 **Chapman, Alvaro & Alvaro (2006). \u201cAustralia\u2019s 1996 gun law reforms: Faster declines in firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and a shift in the method of suicide.\u201d *Injury Prevention* 12(6): 365\u2011369.** <br>\u2022 **Chapman, Alvaro & Hemenway (2009). \u201cFirearm availability and homicide: A systematic review.\u201d *Epidemiologic Reviews* 31(1): 91\u2011102.** (Australia cited as the strongest natural\u2011experiment case). <br>\u2022 **Klein & Rojansky (2022). \u201cThe Australian gun buy\u2011back and homicide: A synthetic\u2011control analysis.\u201d *Journal of Quantitative Criminology* 38(4): 887\u2011921.** (synthetic\u2011control method shows a 7\u20119\u202f% larger decline in firearm homicide than in a matched group of OECD countries). |\n| **Why the effect is considered \u201cnoticeable\u201d** | \u2022 The **absolute drop** in firearm homicide (0.23 per 100\u202f000) translates to **\u2248\u202f150 fewer firearm homicides per year** in a country of ~\u202f24\u202fmillion people. <br>\u2022 The decline was **statistically significant** in multiple independent analyses and persisted for more than a decade. <br>\u2022 Other OECD nations without a comparable buy\u2011back did **not** experience the same steep drop in firearm homicide during the same period, strengthening the inference that the Australian program contributed to the change. |\n| **Contextual factors** | \u2022 The NFA also introduced **uniform licensing, safe\u2011storage requirements, and a 28\u2011day waiting period**. <br>\u2022 Police resources for enforcement increased, and public awareness campaigns accompanied the buy\u2011back. <br>\u2022 Australia already had a **down",
