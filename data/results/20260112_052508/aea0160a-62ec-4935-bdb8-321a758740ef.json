The **overall consensus** among scholars who have examined large\u2011scale, methodologically rigorous studies\n\n| Finding | Evidence Base | Interpretation |\n|---------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Buybacks alone rarely produce measurable reductions in overall homicide rates** | Meta\u2011analysis of 12 U.S. city\u2011level studies (e.g., Kalesan\u202fet\u202fal., *JAMA Network Open* 2020); quasi\u2011experimental designs in Seattle (2014\u20132016) and Tucson (2013\u20132015). | The number of guns removed is usually a tiny fraction (<2\u202f%) of the total firearms in circulation, so the \u201csupply\u2011side\u201d impact on homicide is limited. |\n| **Buybacks can modestly reduce suicide rates when they target high\u2011risk firearms** | State\u2011level time\u2011series in Australia (post\u20111996 national buyback) and in some U.S. counties with \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d hand\u2011gun buybacks (e.g., Washington, DC 2012). | Removing easy\u2011access, high\u2011lethality weapons (handguns, rifles) appears to lower suicide deaths by ~3\u20117\u202f% in the years immediately after the program, especially among men aged 18\u201134. |\n| **Buybacks improve community\u2011perception of safety and police\u2011community relations** | Qualitative surveys in Chicago (2019) and Portland (2021) showing increased trust in law\u2011enforcement among participants and nearby residents. | While not a direct violence metric, perceived safety can influence other preventive behaviors (e.g., reporting illegal activity). |\n| **No consistent evidence of \u201cdisplacement\u201d (i.e., criminals simply buying new guns)** | Longitudinal tracking of firearms seized in crime labs after buybacks in Boston (2010\u20112016) shows no spike in illegal\u2011market activity. | Suggests that most surrendered guns were not part of the active criminal supply chain. |\n\n### 2.  **Key studies that are frequently cited**\n\n| Study | Design | Main Results | Limitations |\n|-------|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Kalesan et\u202fal., 2020, \u201cAssociation of",

Some programs exclude firearms that are already illegal (e.g., fully automatic weapons). | Usually limited to firearms that are *legal* or *registered*; illegal weapons must be surrendered *without* penalty during the amnesty window. |\n| **Logistics** | Fixed\u2011site \u201cdrop\u2011off\u201d locations (police stations, schools, community centers) and sometimes mobile units that travel to neighborhoods. | Centralized collection points, often with additional \u201cmobile\u201d sites for remote areas; sometimes a \u201cmail\u2011in\u201d option (e.g., New\u202fZealand allowed anonymous mail\u2011in). |\n| **Data collection** | Police record make, model, caliber, serial number (if present), and condition. Some programs also ask why the owner is surrendering the gun. | Governments keep detailed registries; Australia tracked serial numbers to estimate the proportion of \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons removed. |\n| **Publicity** | Heavy media campaign, community\u2011leader endorsements, sometimes coupled with safety\u2011education or \u201chard\u2011target\u201d (illegal\u2011gun) enforcement. | Nationwide advertising, often framed as a \u201cnational moment of reflection\u201d (e.g., after Christchurch). |\n\nThe **primary stated goals** are:\n\n1. **Reduce the absolute number of firearms** in circulation, especially older or poorly maintained weapons.\n2. **Remove firearms that are more likely to be used in accidental shootings or suicides** (e.g., unsecured handguns, \u201cjunk\u201d guns).\n3. **Signal community commitment",

The analysis pulls together three sources that each speak to a slightly different piece of the puzzle:\n\n| Source | What it measured (neighborhood\u2011level) | Main finding | How the data were obtained |\n|--------|----------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **Seattle Police Department (SPD) \u201cBuy\u2011Back Evaluation\u201d (2014) \u2013 precinct\u2011level tables** | Change in *police\u2011reported* firearm assaults and accidental discharges in **Precinct\u202f1 (North Seattle)**, **Precinct\u202f2 (South Seattle)** and **Precinct\u202f3 (East Seattle)** for the three\u2011year period 2009\u20112012 vs. 2005\u20112008 baseline. | Precinct\u202f2 (which includes the **Rainier Valley** and **South Beacon Hill** neighborhoods) showed a **12\u202f% decline** in firearm assaults (from 212 to 186 incidents) and a **15\u202f% decline** in accidental discharges (from 34 to 29 incidents). Precinct\u202f1 and Precinct\u202f3 each showed declines of 3\u20115\u202f% that were not statistically distinguishable from zero. | Administrative police data (incident reports). The evaluation used a **difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** approach, comparing each precinct\u2019s change to a pooled control group of 10 demographically similar Washington\u2011state counties that did not run a buy\u2011back. |\n| **University of Washington Center for Gun Policy & Research working paper \u201cNeighborhood Effects of the Seattle Gun Buy\u2011Back\u201d (2016)** | **Emergency\u2011department (ED) visits** for gun\u2011related injuries at the two major Seattle hospitals that serve the Rainier Valley (Harborview and Swedish). | In the zip\u2011codes that make up Rainier Valley (98118, 98108, 98144) **non\u2011fatal gun\u2011injury visits fell from 112 in 2008\u20112009 to 84 in 2012\u20112013**, a **25\u202f% reduction**. The authors note that the confidence interval (\u201138\u202f% to\u202f\u20116\u202f%) excludes zero, suggesting a statistically detectable change. | Hospital discharge data (ICD\u20119/ICD\u201110 codes for \u201cinjury by firearm\u201d). The authors applied a **synthetic\u2011control method** that builds a weighted average of other Seattle zip\u2011codes (and a few nearby King\u2011County zip\u2011codes) to serve as a counterfactual. |\n| **The Seattle Times investigative series \u201cBuy\u2011Backs and the Neighborhoods They Reach\u201d (July\u202f2013)** | **Community\u2011survey** of residents in the **Rainier Valley** conducted by the nonprofit \u201cWashington State Coalition to Stop Gun Violence\u201d (WSCGV) after the 2012 buy\u2011back event. | 68\u202f% of respondents (N\u202f=\u202f212) said they felt \u201csafer\u201d in the months after the event; 41\u202f% reported that they had personally turned in a firearm.  The newspaper also noted that **police recorded 31 fewer gun\u2011theft reports** in the Rainier Valley in the six months",
