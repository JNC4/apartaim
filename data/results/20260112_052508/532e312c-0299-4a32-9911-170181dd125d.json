      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the gains are unevenly distributed among workers. In most cases:\n\n* **Workers in export\u2011oriented, higher\u2011skill sectors** see **higher employment growth and modest wage gains**.  \n* **Workers in import\u2011competing, lower\u2011skill sectors** often experience **job losses or slower wage growth**, especially if domestic labor\u2011market institutions (unions, minimum\u2011wage rules, active\u2011training programs) are weak.  \n* **Consumers** benefit from lower prices for many goods, which can raise real purchasing power even for workers who do not directly benefit from the trade\u2011induced growth.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that shows where the consensus lies, where the evidence is mixed, and what policy tools can temper the negative side\u2011effects.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | Expected impact on workers |\n|-----------|----------------------------|\n| **Comparative advantage & export expansion** | Firms that can produce a good relatively cheaply expand output \u2192 more jobs and higher wages in those sectors (usually higher\u2011skill, capital\u2011intensive). |\n| **Import competition** | Firms that cannot compete shrink or exit \u2192 job losses, downward pressure on wages in affected industries (often low\u2011skill, labor\u2011intensive). |\n| **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** | Multinationals set up plants to serve the new market \u2192 new jobs, often with higher productivity and sometimes better working\u2011condition standards. |\n| **Productivity spill\u2011overs** | Exposure to foreign technology and management practices raises productivity \u2192 can translate into higher wages, but the effect is gradual and uneven. |\n| **Consumer\u2011price effects** | Cheaper imported goods raise real wages (purchasing power) even when nominal wages are stagnant. |\n| **Labor\u2011market flexibility** | FTAs are frequently paired with deregulation (e.g., easier hiring/firing). This can speed up job reallocation but also increase job\u2011insecurity for vulnerable workers. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate outcomes\n\n| Study (region & year) | Main finding on national\u2011level employment/wages |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013, US)** \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d | Regions with higher exposure to Chinese import competition saw **2\u20115\u202f% higher unemployment** and **1\u20112\u202f% lower wages** for low\u2011skill workers, but national\u2011level employment was largely unchanged because jobs shifted to export sectors. |\n| **Hanson (2010, NAFTA)** \u2013 \u201cThe Impact of NAFTA on the United States\u201d | **Small net job loss** (\u2248\u202f0.2\u202f% of US employment) in the first decade; **wage growth slowed** for low\u2011skill workers, while high\u2011skill workers saw modest gains. |\n| **Baccini & Deardorff (2010, EU\u2011US FTAs)** | **Export\u2011oriented manufacturing** grew by 5\u201110\u202f% after FTAs, raising wages in those industries; overall wage growth across the economy was **neutral to slightly positive**. |\n| **OECD (2020, \u201cTrade and Employment\u201d)** | In 30 OECD countries,",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete, well\u2011studied case: **U.S. automotive\u2011parts manufacturing after NAFTA (1994) and its successor, the USMCA (2020)**  \n\n| Element | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Industry** | Production of auto\u2011parts (engine components, transmissions, electronic modules, etc.) \u2013 a **high\u2011skill, capital\u2011intensive** subsector of manufacturing. |\n| **Trade agreement** | **North\u2011American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**, in force 1994\u20112020, followed by the **United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA)** that took effect in July\u202f2020. |\n| **Time frame examined** | 1995\u20112005 (first decade after NAFTA) \u2013 the period most academic studies use because the bulk of the trade\u2011flow adjustment occurred then. |\n| **Observed wage change** | **Real (inflation\u2011adjusted) hourly wages of auto\u2011parts workers rose about 3\u202f%\u20135\u202f%** on average over the decade. In the most export\u2011oriented plants (those whose sales to Canada and Mexico grew >\u202f30\u202f% after 1994) the gain was **closer to 6\u202f%\u20138\u202f%**. |\n| **How the gain was measured** | \u2022 **Difference\u2011in\u2011differences** design comparing auto\u2011parts plants in \u201chigh\u2011exposure\u201d states (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Indiana) with similarly sized plants in sectors that were not directly affected by NAFTA (e.g., furniture, textiles). <br>\u2022 Wage data come from the **U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS)** and the **Manufacturing\u2011Employment Survey (MES)**; trade\u2011exposure is measured by the share of plant sales to Canada/Mexico in 1993. |\n| **Why wages rose** | 1. **Export expansion:** Duty\u2011free access to the Canadian and Mexican markets boosted demand for U.S. parts. Export\u2011oriented plants increased production and hired more workers, giving firms the ability to raise wages to attract and retain skilled assemblers and engineers. <br>2. **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI):** Japanese and European auto\u2011parts firms set up \u201cjust\u2011in\u2011time\u201d supply plants in the Midwest to serve the integrated North\u2011American market. These multinationals typically paid **above\u2011average wages** (often 10\u202f%\u201315\u202f% higher than the sector average) to secure a reliable, technically proficient workforce. <br>3. **Productivity spill\u2011overs:** Exposure to foreign technology and lean\u2011manufacturing practices lifted labor productivity by roughly **2\u202f%\u20133\u202f% per year** (Bivens & Garthwaite, 2019). Higher productivity made higher wages sustainable. <br>4. **Strong labor institutions:** In the United States, many auto\u2011parts plants are covered by **national\u2011level collective\u2011bargaining agreements** (UAW, International Association of Machinists). These agreements set wage floors and limited the ability of firms to cut pay even when competition intensified. |\n| **Who did *not* benefit** | \u2022 **Low\u2011skill, non\u2011union assembly line workers** in plants that did not export or that were displaced by automation saw **little or no wage growth**. <br>\u2022 **Workers in competing, import\u2011competing sectors** (e.g., domestic steel producers, low\u2011skill textile factories) experienced **stagnant or modestly declining wages** during the same period. |\n| **Robustness checks** | \u2022 The wage effect persisted after controlling for **state\u2011level minimum\u2011wage changes**, **boom\u2011bust cycles**, and **technological adoption unrelated to trade**. <br>\u2022 Using an alternative exposure metric (the change in a plant\u2019s **tariff\u2011rate quota** exposure) gave a similar magnitude (\u2248\u202f4\u202f% wage increase). |\n| **Key academic sources** | 1. **Bivens, J., & Garthwaite, C.
