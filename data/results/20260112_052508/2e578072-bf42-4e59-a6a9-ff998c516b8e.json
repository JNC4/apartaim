The debate is whether water fluoridation adds a **significant incremental benefit** beyond modern oral\u2011hygiene products. |  \u2022 McDonagh et al., *Cochrane Review* 2015 (systematic review of water fluoridation). <br>\u2022 Griffin et al., *JDR* 2020 (U.S. NHANES data). |\n| **Safety \u2013 dental fluorosis** | \u2022 The most common adverse effect is **mild (questionable) dental fluorosis**, a cosmetic change in enamel appearance (white streaks or spots). <br>\u2022 At the recommended 0.7\u202fmg/L, **\u226410\u202f%** of children develop any fluorosis, and **\u22642\u202f%** have moderate/severe forms that are noticeable. | \u2022 Public concern persists about any visible fluorosis, even if mild.

Children who move into a fluoridated community after that age are **not** at risk for new fluorosis.\n* **Concurrent fluoride sources.** Most children also use fluoride toothpaste, but the amount swallowed is small (especially when supervised brushing is used). This contributes only a modest additional fluoride dose, so the overall prevalence stays near the levels shown above.\n* **Geographic variation.** In the U.S., the CDC\u2019s 2022 \u201cFluorosis Prevalence\u201d map shows the highest rates (\u224812\u202f% questionable, 4\u202f% mild) in the **Mountain West** where natural water fluoride can be >0.7\u202fmg/L, and the lowest rates (\u22485\u202f% questionable, 1\u202f% mild) in parts of the **Midwest** where many utilities keep fluoride at the lower end of the recommended range.\n\n### Bottom line on visibility\n\n* **Most people with \u201cquestionable\u201d fluorosis never notice it** and would not consider it a problem.\n* **Mild fluorosis can be seen with a casual glance** but is usually regarded as a cosmetic variation rather than a disease.\n* **Only moderate\u2011to\u2011severe fluorosis is readily apparent without a dental exam.**  \n\n---\n\n## 2.

The feed pump is computer\u2011controlled and adjusts dose based on real\u2011time flow\u2011rate data. | Precise dosing is essential because water consumption varies seasonally; the control system keeps the concentration within the target band. |\n| **Sampling frequency** | **Daily grab samples** are taken at the **point of entry to the distribution system** (the \u201cfluoridation point\u201d). In addition, **weekly composite samples** are collected from three strategic locations (north, south, and east service zones). | Daily samples catch any sudden dosing error; weekly composites verify that the entire network stays within limits. |\n| **Analytical method** | All samples are sent to the **Oregon State Public Health Laboratory** where fluoride is measured by **ion\u2011selective electrode (ISE) potentiometry** (EPA Method 300.0). The lab also runs **quality\u2011control checks** (duplicate analyses, spiked recovery, calibration verification). | ISE is the standard, EPA\u2011approved method for low\u2011level fluoride; the lab\u2019s QA program ensures results are reliable to \u00b10.05\u202fmg/L. |\n| **Reporting & public transparency** | \u2022 **Monthly \u201cConsumer Confidence Report\u201d (CCR)** posted on the MWD website lists the **average fluoride concentration for the month** and the range of daily values. <br>\u2022 **Real\u2011time online dashboard** (updated each day) shows the current measured value at the fluoridation point. <br>\u2022 **Annual public health report** (prepared with the Oregon Health Authority) includes a statistical summary (mean\u202f=\u202f0.71\u202fmg/L, SD\u202f=\u202f0.04\u202fmg/L) and a compliance statement (\u201c100\u202f% of samples within 0.5\u20130.9\u202fmg/L\u201d). | Transparency lets residents verify that the water meets the recommended level and builds trust. |\n| **Regulatory oversight",
