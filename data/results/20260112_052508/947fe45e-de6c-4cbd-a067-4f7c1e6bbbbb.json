Molecular characterisation** | \u2022 Inserted a single *cry1Ab* gene from *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) into the maize genome. <br>\u2022 The transgene cassette also contains a promoter (maize ubiquitin), a terminator and a selectable marker (phosphinothricin\u2011acetyltransferase, *bar*). <br>\u2022 Sequencing showed a clean insertion at chromosome\u202f5, no vector backbone fragments. | Demonstrated that only the intended DNA is present and that the insertion site does not disrupt any known endogenous gene. |\n| **2. Bioinformatic screening** | \u2022 *Cry1Ab* protein sequence compared against the AllergenOnline and UniProt toxin databases \u2013 no \u226535\u202f% identity over 80\u202faa to any known allergen or toxin. <br>\u2022 *Bar* protein similarly screened \u2013 no matches. | Early \u201cno\u2011red flag\u201d result, allowing the programme to move forward. |\n| **3. Protein safety testing** | \u2022 **Acute oral toxicity** in mice (LD50\u202f>\u202f5\u202fg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9) \u2013 essentially non\u2011toxic. <br>\u2022 **90\u2011day sub\u2011chronic feeding** in rats fed purified Cry1Ab protein at up to 5\u202f% of diet \u2013 no adverse clinical, hematological or histopathological effects; NOAEL identified at the highest dose tested. | Showed that the novel protein itself is not toxic at exposure levels far above what humans would ever encounter. |\n| **4. Allergenicity assessment** | \u2022 Heat\u2011stability test: Cry1Ab lost >90\u202f% activity after 10\u202fmin at 95\u202f\u00b0C, indicating it is readily denatured. <br>\u2022 Simulated gastric digestion: >95\u202f% degraded within 2\u202fmin at pH\u202f2. <br>\u2022 No IgE binding observed with sera from >30 maize\u2011allergic patients. | The protein behaves like typical non\u2011allergenic proteins (rapidly digested, heat\u2011labile). |\n| **5. Compositional analysis** | \u2022 12 field sites in the EU, USA, Brazil, and South Africa; each compared with a non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic line grown under identical agronomic conditions. <br>\u2022 Measured >70 constituents (proximate composition, vitamins, minerals, antinutrients, mycotoxins). <br>\u2022 All values fell within the natural variation range of conventional maize. | No unintended changes in nutrients or harmful metabolites were detected. |\n| **6. Nutritional assessment** | \u2022 Because the trait is insect\u2011resistance, the goal was **equivalence**, not enhancement. The compositional data confirmed that MON\u202f810 provides the same nutritional profile as conventional maize. | Satisfied the requirement that the GM product is nutritionally comparable to its conventional counterpart. |\n| **7. Whole\u2011food animal feeding studies** | \u2022 90\u2011day rat study feeding diets containing 30\u202f% (w/w) MON\u202f810 grain, the highest level that still allowed normal growth. <br>\u2022 End\u2011points: body weight, feed intake, organ weights, clinical chemistry, histopathology, reproduction parameters. <br>\u2022 No statistically or biologically significant differences versus control diet. | Whole\u2011food data reinforced the protein\u2011level safety findings. |\n| **8. Environmental & agronomic assessment** | \u2022 Field trials demonstrated that the Cry1Ab trait reduces *European corn borer* damage without increasing weediness or gene flow concerns. <br>\u2022 No adverse effects on non\u2011target organisms (e.g., beneficial insects, soil microbes) were observed in EFSA\u2011mandated studies. | Although not a direct human\u2011health test, the environmental dossier showed that the crop does not create downstream food\u2011safety issues (e.g., higher pesticide residues). |\n| **9.
