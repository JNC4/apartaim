What sanctions are meant to do**\n\n| Goal | How it is supposed to work | Typical tools |\n|------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| **Coerce a policy change** (e.g., stop a nuclear program, end aggression) | Reduce the target\u2019s ability to fund or sustain the objectionable activity while raising the political cost of continuing it. The hope is that the leadership will calculate that the losses outweigh the benefits. | Trade bans, asset freezes, financial\u2011market restrictions, secondary (third\u2011party) embargoes. |\n| **Punish** (signal disapproval, impose costs for a past act) | Create material hardship for elites or the broader population, thereby signaling that the international community will respond to violations. | Targeted sanctions on individuals, companies, or sectors; travel bans. |\n| **Signal & isolate** (diplomatic pressure, deter others) | Show that certain behavior will be met with collective action, discouraging similar moves by other states. | Broad multilateral embargoes, public naming of violators. |\n| **Encourage compliance with norms** (human\u2011rights, anti\u2011terrorism) | Provide a non\u2011military lever that can be escalated or lifted, giving the target a clear \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d path. | Conditional humanitarian exemptions, step\u2011wise lifting contingent on verifiable actions. |\n\nThe *mechanism* is essentially economic pressure: cutting off export revenues, limiting access to finance, raising the cost of imports, and/or freezing assets abroad. The pressure can be **general** (affecting the whole economy) or **targeted** (aimed at political elites, military procurement, or specific industries).\n\n---\n\n**2. What the research says about success rates**\n\n| Study / Dataset | Scope | Main finding on effectiveness |\n|-----------------|-------|--------------------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007) \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*** | 191 cases (1970\u20112005), multivariate regression | **\u2248 34\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their primary objective; success rose to **\u2248 50\u202f%** when sanctions were multilateral, targeted, and combined with diplomatic pressure. |\n| **Drezner (2011) \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox*** | Meta\u2011analysis of 115 cases | Success is higher when the target is a **democracy**, when the sanctioning coalition is **unanimous**, and when the costs are **concentrated on the ruling elite**. |\n| **Pape (1997) \u2013 *Why Economic Sanctions Fail*** | 120 cases (1945\u20111994) | **Only 5\u202f%** of sanctions forced a target to change its behavior; most failures were due to the target\u2019s ability to find alternative trade partners or the sanctions\u2019 impact being spread across the population rather than the leadership. |\n| **Hughes & McGregor (2022) \u2013 *Sanctions in the 21st Century*** | Post\u2011Cold\u2011War cases, including Russia (2014\u20112022) and Iran (2006\u20112021) | **Mixed results**: Iran\u2019s nuclear negotiations were partly driven by sanctions, but the regime also used sanctions to rally nationalist support. For Russia, sanctions have strained the economy but have not yet compelled a cessation of the Ukraine war. |\n| **World Bank \u201cDoing Business\u201d impact studies (2018\u20112023)** | Country\u2011level GDP growth under sanctions | Average **GDP loss of 2\u20115\u202f% per year** for targeted economies; larger losses (>10\u202f%) when sanctions are comprehensive and the country is heavily dependent on the blocked sector (e.g., oil for Venezuela, Russia). |\n\n**Key take\u2011aways from the literature**\n\n1. **Success is far from guaranteed** \u2013 most sanctions do not achieve their stated political goal outright.  \n2. **Multilateral, targeted, and coordinated sanctions** are more likely to work than unilateral, broad trade embargoes.  \n3. **Regime type matters** \u2013 autocratic leaders can more easily absorb popular hardship, whereas democracies face domestic pressure to lift sanctions.  \n4. **Availability of alternatives** (e.g., China or Iran\u2019s ability to trade with non\u2011Western partners) dramatically reduces leverage.  \n5. **Sanctions can have unintended side\u2011effects**: humanitarian suffering, rally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag effects, or strengthening of \u201csanction\u2011busting\u201d networks.\n\n---\n\n**3.

The basic logic of sanctions  \n\n| Step | Intended causal chain | What policymakers hope will happen |\n|------|----------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **a.  Imposition** | A state (or a multilateral body such as the UN, EU, or a coalition of countries) restricts trade, financial flows, investment, travel, or access to technology for a target country (or specific individuals/companies). | Creates a *cost* for the target that is *avoidable* only by changing the disputed behavior. |\n| **b.  Economic pressure** | Reduced export revenues, higher import prices, loss of foreign investment, restricted access to international finance, and/or diminished ability to procure critical inputs (e.g., oil, chips, pharmaceuticals). | Weakens the target\u2019s macro\u2011economy, erodes elite rents, and raises the political price of continuing the objectionable policy. |\n| **c.  Political pressure** | Economic pain translates into internal dissent, elite defections, or a shift in cost\u2011benefit calculations of the ruling coalition. | The target\u2019s leadership either **(i)** complies with the demand, **(ii)** offers a negotiated compromise, or **(iii)** resists, prompting either a *hardening* of sanctions or a move to other tools (e.g., military force). |\n\n### Two main \u201cmechanisms\u201d that scholars talk about\n\n1. **Coercive (or \u201chard\u201d) mechanism** \u2013 sanctions are meant to *force* a change by making the status quo more costly than the alternative.\n2. **Signaling / normative mechanism** \u2013 sanctions are used to *punish* a behavior, stigmatize a regime, or signal to third parties (including domestic audiences) that certain actions are unacceptable. Even if the target does not change, the sanction\u2011imposing state may achieve diplomatic leverage or domestic political wins.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Taxonomy of sanctions (helps explain why outcomes differ)\n\n| Type | Typical scope | Main goal | Typical success record (see Section\u202f3) |\n|------|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Comprehensive (trade) embargoes** | All or most imports/exports, sometimes including oil and financial flows. | Regime change, containment. | Low \u2013\u202f~10\u201120\u202f% success in achieving coercive goals (see below). |\n| **Targeted (or \u201csmart\u201d) sanctions** | Freeze assets, ban travel, restrict specific sectors (e.g., arms, nuclear tech), or blacklist individuals/companies. | Change elite behavior while sparing the broader population. | Higher \u2013\u202f~30\u201145\u202f% success for coercive aims; higher for signaling. |\n| **Secondary sanctions** | Threaten third\u2011party firms with penalties for dealing with the primary target. | Extend reach of primary sanctions; deter circumvention. | Moderately effective when the sanctioning state dominates the relevant market (e.g., U.S. dollar\u2011clearing). |\n| **Financial\u2011sector sanctions** (SWIFT bans, asset freezes) | Cut off access to global banking and payment systems. | Rapidly cripple ability to finance illicit activities. | Effective in the short run, but often circumvented through alternative networks. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific sanctions** (e.g., oil, technology, weapons) | Block a key export/import that is vital for the target\u2019s revenue or capability. | Reduce resources for objectionable programs (nuclear, missiles). | Success varies with",

The **threat of secondary sanctions** forced even Asian buyers (China, India) to reduce purchases, leaving Iran with few alternatives. |\n| **Economic impact** | \u2022 **Oil\u2011export revenue fell** from \u2248\u202f$55\u202fbillion (2011) to \u2248\u202f$15\u202fbillion (2014).<br>\u2022 **Iran\u2019s foreign\u2011exchange reserves** shrank from >\u202f$100\u202fbillion (early 2012) to <\u202f$30\u202fbillion (end\u202f2014).<br>\u2022 **Inflation** spiked above 30\u202f% and the rial depreciated sharply, raising the cost of imported goods and putting pressure on the regime\u2019s budget. | The **budget shortfall** hit the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s procurement of centrifuges and the government\u2019s ability to subsidise the domestic economy\u2014both central to the nuclear\u2011program agenda. |\n| **Political response** | \u2022 Iranian leadership publicly framed the sanctions as \u201ceconomic warfare,\u201d but **internal elite debates** grew louder as the economy deteriorated.<br>\u2022 Moderates around President **Hassan\u202fRohani** (elected 2013) used the crisis to argue for diplomatic engagement.<br>\u2022 The **Supreme Leader** and hard\u2011liners eventually authorised \u201cflexible\u201d negotiations, knowing that without relief the nuclear program could become financially unsustainable. | The **target",
