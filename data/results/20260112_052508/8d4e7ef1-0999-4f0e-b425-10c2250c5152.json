      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nEconomic sanctions try to change a target country\u2019s behaviour by making the cost of continuing a disputed policy higher than the benefit of keeping it.  Whether they succeed depends on a bundle of political\u2011economic factors \u2013 the target\u2019s economic openness, the unity and credibility of the sanctioning coalition, the presence of viable \u201csanctions\u2011busting\u201d partners, the design of the measures (broad vs. targeted), and the domestic politics of both the target and the imposing states.  In practice sanctions sometimes achieve their aims, sometimes only produce limited or unintended effects, and often take years to show measurable change.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the mechanisms, the conditions that matter, the empirical record, and the main points of scholarly debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How sanctions are supposed to work  \n\n| Step | Description | Typical policy tools |\n|------|-------------|----------------------|\n| **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Raise the cost** | Reduce a target\u2019s access to foreign markets, finance, or technology, thereby hurting its economy, elites, or specific sectors. | Trade bans, asset freezes, financial\u2011transaction restrictions, secondary sanctions on third\u2011party firms. |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Create a \u201cpain\u2011vs\u2011gain\u201d calculus** | Decision\u2011makers compare the economic/political loss of compliance with the perceived benefit of the prohibited behaviour (e.g., nuclear weapons, aggression, human\u2011rights violations). | Same as above; often paired with diplomatic incentives (\u201ccarrots\u201d) if the target shows willingness to negotiate. |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Signal resolve and credibility** | By imposing sanctions, the sender demonstrates willingness to punish non\u2011compliance, which can influence the target\u2019s expectations about future costs. | Public statements, UN resolutions, coordinated multilateral actions. |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Mobilise domestic and international audiences** | Sanctions can be used to show domestic constituencies that the government is \u201cdoing something\u201d and to pressure allies of the target to distance themselves. | Media campaigns, \u201cnaming\u2011and\u2011shaming\u201d reports, secondary sanctions that threaten third\u2011party investors. |\n\nThe *theoretical* backbone is **coercive diplomacy**: a threat (or limited use) of force that is cheaper than war but credible enough to make the opponent change its policy (Pape\u202f1997; Alexander\u202f2001).  Sanctions are the \u201cnon\u2011military\u201d instrument in that toolbox.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Key factors that shape the impact of sanctions  \n\n| Factor | Why it matters | Typical empirical findings |\n|--------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Economic openness** | Open economies depend more on foreign trade/finance, so cuts bite harder. | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007) find that *high\u2011openness* states are about **1.4\u20112\u00d7** more likely to comply. |\n| **Political regime type** | Autocracies can insulate elites and control information, but may also be more vulnerable to elite defection. | Drezner (2011) argues that *democracies* are slightly more responsive; however, Giumelli et al. (2021) show that **authoritarian resilience** can make sanctions less effective unless elite incentives are directly hit. |\n| **Sanction design (targeted vs. comprehensive)** | Targeted (e.g., asset freezes",
      "truthbot_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013\u202fwhat the evidence says about how they affect target\u2011state behaviour**  \n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most robust research, expert surveys, and historical case\u2011studies on the question *\u201cHow do economic sanctions typically influence the behaviour or policies of the countries they\u2019re aimed at?\u201d*  The material is organized by the main mechanisms that scholars and practitioners identify, followed by an assessment of where the scholarly consensus lies, where the evidence is mixed, and what still remains unknown.  Wherever possible I note studies that are often left out of popular discussions.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Theoretical pathways \u2013\u202fhow sanctions are supposed to work  \n\n| Pathway | Core idea | Typical empirical proxies |\n|---------|-----------|----------------------------|\n| **Coercive pressure** | Reducing the target\u2019s ability to finance undesired actions (e.g., war, nuclear weapons) makes the cost of continuing those actions higher than the benefit. | Changes in GDP, trade volume, foreign\u2011exchange reserves, financing costs. |\n| **Signalling & credibility** | Sanctions demonstrate resolve; they can raise the political cost of defiance for the target\u2019s leadership (domestic or elite audiences). | Opinion\u2011poll data, elite interviews, regime\u2011stability indices. |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | Economic hardship can trigger public unrest or elite dissent, forcing policy change. | Protest counts, regime\u2011change events, elite defection. |\n| **Punitive / normative pressure** | Sanctions are meant to stigmatise the target, delegitimising its actions internationally. | UN voting patterns, diplomatic isolation metrics. |\n| **Deterrence of third\u2011party support** | By making it costly for allies to trade with the target, sanctions aim to cut off external assistance. | Secondary\u2011sanction enforcement, trade flows with allies. |\n\n> **Key point:**  The *same* sanction can activate several pathways simultaneously, and the relative strength of each pathway varies across cases.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Direct wealth loss** | The U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) listed **Senior Minister **P.\u202fW. Botha** (and later other cabinet members) and froze any U.S.\u2011dollar\u2011denominated accounts they held abroad. | In 1986, OFAC placed *P.\u202fW. Botha* and *F.\u202fW. de\u202fKlerk* on the **Specially Designated Nationals (SDN)** list. Their offshore accounts in New\u202fYork and London were blocked, and any U.S. bank was ordered to refuse further transactions. | The personal financial hit was symbolic (the elite\u2019s offshore holdings were modest compared with the nation\u2019s GDP) **but** it signaled that even the highest officials could be singled out, raising the *perceived personal risk* of staying in office. |\n| **b. Cutting off the elite\u2019s access to global finance** | Secondary\u2011sanctions language in the U.S. **Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act (CAAA)** warned European banks that *any* transaction that facilitated the movement of South\u2011African assets could trigger a U.S. secondary sanction. | After the CAAA\u2019s passage (1986), **Citibank** and **Barclays** voluntarily closed accounts for a handful of South\u2011African corporations linked to the apartheid government to avoid being black\u2011listed. | The elite could no longer rely on *offshore banks* to park or move money, forcing them to either *liquidate assets* at fire\u2011sale prices or **seek political concessions** to restore access. |\n| **c. Travel bans that isolated decision\u2011makers** | The EU\u2019s **1993 sanctions package** added a *travel\u2011restriction* clause for anyone on the UN\u2019s \u201cSpecially Designated Persons\u201d list. | In 1993, **Minister of Defence** *M.\u202fJ.\u202fMatsapa* was denied entry to the United Kingdom.
