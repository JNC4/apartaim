The material is organized by the major mechanisms through which rent control can influence affordability, with notes on how certain findings are well\u2011established and where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe bulk of peer\u2011reviewed research and the overwhelming majority of professional economists conclude that *long\u2011run* rent\u2011control policies that keep existing rents below market rates **reduce the overall supply of rental housing**, **raise rents in the uncontrolled segment of the market**, and **deter investment in new rental construction**. Those same policies do, however, **protect the purchasing power of the tenants who are already living in controlled units**, at least while they remain in those units.  \n\nThe net effect on *city\u2011wide* housing affordability therefore depends on three \u201cmoving parts\u201d:\n\n| What rent control directly does | Typical long\u2011run consequence (most studies) | How it can offset the consequence (if at all) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Caps the rent that can be charged on a given unit | Reduces the net present value of owning/operating a rental \u2192 landlords withdraw units from the market, convert to condos, or let them fall into disrepair. | Allow rent increases tied to inflation or to the unit\u2019s operating costs; combine with incentives for new construction (density bonuses, tax credits). |\n| Limits rent hikes when a tenant moves out (vacancy decontrol) or ties them to a formula | Creates \u201clock\u2011in\u201d incentives for tenants to stay long\u2011term, which can exacerbate turnover costs for landlords and lower turnover\u2011related rent adjustments. | Permit larger \u201creset\u201d rents after vacancy; allow landlords to recoup capital improvements. |\n| Provides a legal right to stay (often with \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction protections) | Improves housing stability for existing tenants, reducing displacement and associated social costs. | The stability benefit is largely limited to the already\u2011protected cohort; new renters do not gain the same benefit. |\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, source\u2011by\u2011source synthesis** that follows the five duties laid out in the system prompt.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case study: San\u202fFrancisco (1994\u20112020)\n\n**Why San\u202fFrancisco is often used in the academic literature**\n\n* It has a long\u2011run, city\u2011wide rent\u2011control ordinance (the **1979 \u201cRent Control Ordinance\u201d**) that caps rents on about 30\u202f% of the housing stock (mostly pre\u20111979 units).  \n* In 1994 the city **repealed \u201cvacancy decontrol,\u201d** meaning that once a rent\u2011controlled unit became vacant, the landlord could no longer raise the rent to market levels; the unit remained under the ceiling forever.  \n* The policy change created a clear \u201cbefore\u2011and\u2011after\u201d break\u2011point that researchers can exploit with quasi\u2011experimental methods (difference\u2011in\u2011differences, synthetic\u2011control, etc.).  \n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most frequently cited empirical work on how that policy shift affected **new rental\u2011unit construction** in the city.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
