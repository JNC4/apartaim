      "unknown_model_response": "**Overview**\n\nDoctors recommend childhood vaccination for three broad reasons that are supported by decades of research, surveillance, and public\u2011health experience:\n\n| Reason | What it means for the child (and the community) | Typical evidence that doctors cite |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Direct protection** | The vaccine trains the child\u2019s immune system to recognise and fight a specific pathogen without the child having to suffer the disease first. | Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and post\u2011licensure effectiveness studies show large reductions in disease incidence (e.g., \u2265\u202f90\u202f% drop in measles cases after two\u2011dose MMR). |\n| **Community (herd) protection** | When enough people are immune, the pathogen finds it harder to spread, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (infants too young for some vaccines, people with certain medical conditions). | Epidemiologic models and real\u2011world data (e.g., the 2014\u20112015 measles outbreak in the U.S. was concentrated in communities with <\u202f90\u202f% coverage). |\n| **Societal benefits** | Fewer cases mean lower health\u2011care costs, fewer school absences, and a lower risk of long\u2011term complications (e.g., paralysis from polio, hearing loss from meningitis). | Cost\u2011effectiveness analyses (e.g., the WHO estimates that every US\u202f$1 spent on routine childhood immunisation yields US\u202f$16 in health\u2011system savings). |\n\nBelow is a more detailed look at each rationale, the evidence that backs it, and the current scientific consensus on vaccine safety.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The second exposure also catches the small fraction of children who did **not** respond to the first dose (the **primary\u2011failure** group). |\n| **How many children need the booster?** | In the United States, about **5\u202f%\u20137\u202f%** of kids do not seroconvert after a single MMR dose. After the second dose, **>\u202f99\u202f%** have protective antibody titres. |\n| **Why are the doses spaced 4\u202fyears apart?** | 1. **Maturation of the immune system** \u2013 infants\u2019 immune cells are still developing; waiting until the child is \u2265\u202f12\u202fmonths allows a more robust primary response. 2. **Practical school\u2011entry timing** \u2013 the second dose at 4\u20116\u202fyears coincides with kindergarten/early elementary enrollment, a point when children congregate and transmission risk rises. 3. **Waning immunity** \u2013 although measles\u2011specific antibodies remain protective for many years after a single dose, a small proportion decay below the protective threshold; the booster \u201cre\u2011charges\u201d the antibody pool. |\n| **Does the second dose give any new antigens?** | No. The composition of the vaccine is identical. The boost works because the immune system has already been \u201ctrained\u201d and can now respond more quickly and at higher magnitude. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Immunologic Mechanism Behind a Two\u2011Dose Schedule  \n\n### 1.1. Primary (first\u2011dose) response  \n\n1. **Antigen presentation** \u2013 The attenuated (live\u2011but\u2011non\u2011replicating) measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are taken up by dendritic cells in the muscle and regional lymph nodes.  \n2. **Na\u00efve B\u2011cell activation** \u2013 B\u2011cells that recognise the viral surface proteins start to proliferate and differentiate into short\u2011lived plasma cells, secreting low\u2011to\u2011moderate levels of IgM \u2192 IgG antibodies.  \n3. **T\u2011cell help** \u2013 CD4\u207a helper T cells provide cytokines that enhance B\u2011cell maturation and also generate a pool of memory T cells.  \n4. **Outcome** \u2013 Peak antibody titres appear **2\u20133\u202fweeks** after vaccination. In most children these titres are *above* the protective cut\u2011off (e.g., \u2265\u202f120\u202fmIU/mL for measles), but in 5\u20137\u202f% they fall short (primary non\u2011responders).\n\n### 1.2. Secondary (booster) response  \n\n1. **Memory cell re\u2011activation** \u2013 When the same antigens are re\u2011introduced (the second dose), memory B cells rapidly differentiate into high\u2011output plasma cells, producing **10\u2011 to 100\u2011fold higher** antibody concentrations.  \n2. **Affinity maturation** \u2013 The antibodies generated after the booster have higher binding strength (affinity) for the virus, making them more effective at neutralising infection.  \n3. **Long\u2011lived plasma cells** \u2013 Some of the newly formed plasma cells migrate to the bone marrow and secrete antibodies for years, providing durable protection.  \n4. **Result** \u2013 After the second dose, **>\u202f99\u202f%** of children have antibody titres well above the protective threshold, and the **rate of waning** is dramatically slower.\n\n> **Key point:** The second dose is **not** a \u201crepeat\u201d of the first; it is a *boost* that transforms a modest, variable response into a uniformly high, long\u2011lasting one.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
