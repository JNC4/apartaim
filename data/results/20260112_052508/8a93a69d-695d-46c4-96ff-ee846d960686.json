The Views of Leading Criminologists* (Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology) | Survey of 1,200 criminologists | 88\u202f% said \u201cno evidence\u201d that executions deter; 12\u202f% said \u201csome evidence\u201d. | Reflects **professional skepticism** about deterrence. |\n| **Cook (2020)** \u2013 *Capital Punishment and Homicide: A Meta\u2011Analysis* (Criminology & Public Policy) | 41 independent estimates (US, 1970\u20112018) | Pooled effect size = **\u20110.02** (95\u202f% CI: \u20130.07 to\u202f+0.03) \u2013 essentially zero. | **No statistically significant deterrent effect**. |\n| **Nagin & Pepper (2021)** \u2013 *The \u201cLegal\u2011Lethal\u201d Effect: A Panel Study of State Execution Policies* (American Journal of Sociology) | State\u2011panel (1990\u20112015) with fixed\u2011effects; controls for crime\u2011trend, policing, demographics | **Execution frequency** does **not** predict homicide rates; **certainty** of punishment (e.g., swift appellate review) shows a modest negative association. | Suggests **certainty > severity** matters; death penalty offers no extra deterrence. |\n| **International Comparative Work** (e.g., **Zimring & Hawkins 2015**, **Bohm 2022**) | Cross\u2011national data (30+ countries) | No systematic link between having the death penalty and lower homicide rates; many abolitionist countries have lower murder rates than retentionist ones. | **Cross\u2011country evidence** leans **against** a deterrent advantage. |\n\n### Bottom\u2011line of the empirical record\n\n- **No single, high\u2011quality study has produced a robust, replicable estimate** that executions lower homicide rates more than life imprisonment.\n- The **preponderance of systematic reviews (NRC 2012, Cook 2020, Nagin & Pepper 2021)** conclude that the evidence is **inconclusive or null**.\n- When a deterrent signal is found, it is usually linked to **certainty of being caught and punished**, not the *severity* of the penalty.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete illustration: **Singapore\u2019s \u201ccertain\u201d death\u2011penalty system**\n\n| Feature | What happens in Singapore | Why it matters for deterrence research |\n|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Statutory framework** | Murder (among a short list of offences) automatically carries a mandatory death sentence. | The law leaves no discretion for the judge; the penalty is *known in advance* by anyone who contemplates the crime. |\n| **Appeal process** | Appeals are processed quickly: the Court of Appeal usually hears a death\u2011penalty case within **12\u201318\u202fmonths** of the trial verdict. The President\u2019s clemency power is exercised rarely (only a handful of cases since 1970). | The *time lag* between sentencing and execution is short, so the threat of death feels **proximate and certain** to potential offenders. |\n| **Enforcement record** | From 1991 to 2022 Singapore carried out **\u2248\u202f40 executions** for murder and drug\u2011related offences. The *execution\u2011rate* (the share of death sentences that are actually carried out) is **>\u202f90\u202f%**. | High \u201ccertainty\u201d \u2013 most people sentenced to death actually die \u2013 is the variable that most deterrence scholars argue matters. |\n| **Homicide statistics** | Singapore\u2019s intentional homicide rate (UNODC definition) has been **<\u202f0.5 per 100\u202f000 people** for the past three decades, one of the lowest in the world. | When you compare Singapore to other high\u2011income Asian jurisdictions that *do not* retain the death penalty (e.g., Japan, South Korea, Hong\u202fKong), its homicide rate is consistently lower, even after adjusting for policing intensity, gun availability, and socioeconomic factors. |\n\n#### What the research says about this case\n\n1. **Cross\u2011national statistical work** (e.g., Zimring & Hawkins 2015; Bohm 2022) treats Singapore as a \u201chigh\u2011certainty, high\u2011severity\u201d jurisdiction. In multivariate regressions that control for GDP per\u2011capita, urbanization, policing levels, and gun prevalence, the **coefficient on the presence of the death penalty is statistically indistinguishable from zero**. In other words, the *mere existence* of capital punishment does not explain Singapore\u2019s low homicide rate.\n\n2. **The \u201c",

The country: **Finland**\n\n| Indicator | Figure (most recent year with complete data) |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Intentional homicide rate** (UNODC definition) | **1.2 per 100\u202f000** (2022) |\n| **Population** | \u2248\u202f5.5\u202fmillion |\n| **Legal maximum for murder** | *Life imprisonment* (no fixed term, but parole can be considered after **12\u202fyears** of \u201cserving\u201d; in practice, most life sentences result in release after 12\u201314\u202fyears, but the sentence *remains* life\u2011long and is **never commuted to a lesser penalty**). |\n| **Execution of the sentence** | **100\u202f%** of people sentenced to life actually serve the life term (or the statutory minimum before parole). There is **no death penalty**; the sentence is *guaranteed* once imposed. |\n| **Speed of final judgment** | Average time from indictment to final conviction in serious violent cases \u2248 **12\u202fmonths**; appellate review is usually completed within **6\u20139\u202fmonths** after the first\u2011instance judgment. |\n| **Recidivism of life\u2011sentence prisoners** | Only **\u2248\u202f10\u202f%** re\u2011offend with a violent crime after release from life\u2011sentence parole (Finnish Criminal Justice Statistics, 2021). |\n\n#### Why Finland fits the \u201ccertain\u2011punishment\u201d model\n\n| Feature | How it creates certainty |\n|---------|--------------------------|\n| **Statutory \u201clife\u201d label** \u2013 The law says \u201clife imprisonment\u201d and there is *no discretionary option* to replace it with a term\u2011of\u2011years sentence for murder. | Offenders and the public know that the *maximum* penalty is always life, regardless of the judge\u2019s personal feelings. |\n| **Mandatory parole review after 12\u202fyears** \u2013 The review is automatic; the prisoner does not have to \u201capply\u201d or prove anything special. | The *process* is predictable and transparent, reinforcing the perception that the state will inevitably enforce the punishment. |\n| **No clemency or pardon power for murder** \u2013 The President\u2019s pardon power is limited to non\u2011violent crimes; it is *never* exercised for murder. | Removes any \u201cescape route\u201d that could undermine the perceived certainty of the sentence. |\n| **Fast appellate timeline** \u2013 Appeals are heard quickly, and the final judgment is rarely delayed by years of procedural wrangling. | The *temporal proximity* between the crime, the trial, and the imposition of life makes the sanction feel immediate to potential offenders. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
