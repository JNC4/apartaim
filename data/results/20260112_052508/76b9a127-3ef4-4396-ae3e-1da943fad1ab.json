      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Most major health bodies agree that eating a lot of *processed* red meat (e.g., bacon, sausage, ham, salami) increases the risk of several cancers, especially colorectal cancer.**  \n- The evidence that *unprocessed* red meat (beef, pork, lamb, veal) raises cancer risk is weaker, but many studies still show a modest increase in colorectal\u2011cancer risk when intake is high (\u2248\u202f>\u202f100\u202fg cooked weight per day).  \n- The absolute increase in risk for an average adult is small (a few extra cases per 10\u202f000 people per year), but the relationship is dose\u2011dependent and appears to be driven mainly by the amount of processed meat and by high\u2011temperature cooking methods.  \n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that lets you see the whole picture and decide what is relevant for you.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the major agencies say\n\n| Agency / Report | Classification of Red Meat | Key quantitative finding* |\n|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO) 2015** | *Processed meat* \u2013 **Group\u202f1** (carcinogenic to humans).<br>*Red meat (unprocessed)* \u2013 **Group\u202f2A** (probably carcinogenic). | Processed meat: ~18\u202f% higher colorectal\u2011cancer risk per 50\u202fg/day.<br>Red meat: ~17\u202f% higher colorectal\u2011cancer risk per 100\u202fg/day. |\n| **World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) 2020\u20112022 Continuous Update Project** | Strong evidence that processed meat causes colorectal cancer; probable link for unprocessed red meat. | Recommend \u2264\u202f500\u202fg cooked weight per week of unprocessed red meat; avoid processed meat. |\n| **American Cancer Society (2023) guidelines** | \u201cStrong\u201d evidence linking processed meat with colorectal cancer; \u201cmoderate\u201d evidence for unprocessed red meat. | Suggest limiting processed meat and keeping unprocessed red meat to \u2264\u202f18\u202foz (\u2248\u202f510\u202fg) per week. |\n| **U.S. Dietary Guidelines (2020\u20112025)** | No specific cancer warning, but advise \u201clean\u201d meats and to limit processed meats for overall health. | Emphasize plant\u2011based proteins for chronic\u2011disease risk reduction. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2021 review** | Confirms IARC classification; notes that evidence for cancers other than colorectal is \u201climited\u201d. | Recommends limiting processed meat intake, especially for high\u2011risk groups. |\n\n\\*Numbers are pooled relative\u2011risk (RR) estimates from large meta\u2011analyses; they represent *relative* (not absolute) risk.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Indirect heat or moist cooking keeps temperatures lower and the meat stays moist, limiting HCA formation. |\n| **Trim visible fat & prevent flare\u2011ups** | \u2022 Cut off the outer fat layer before cooking. <br>\u2022 Use a grill mat or foil to catch drippings. | Fat that drips onto flames creates smoke that deposits PAHs on the meat surface. Less fat = less smoke = fewer PAHs. |\n| **Marinate with antioxidant\u2011rich ingredients** | \u2022 30\u2011min\u20132\u2011hour soak in a mix of **olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, thyme, or black pepper**. <br>\u2022 Add a splash of **vinegar** or **wine**. | Polyphenols and vitamin\u202fC in these marinades can cut HCA formation by **30\u201190\u202f%** in lab tests. |\n| **Pre\u2011cook at low temperature, then finish quickly",
