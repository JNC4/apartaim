      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) is a set of central\u2011bank tools that expands the monetary base by buying large quantities of securities (usually government bonds, sometimes corporate or mortgage\u2011backed securities).**  \nThe goal is to lower long\u2011term interest rates, improve the functioning of credit markets and lift aggregate demand when conventional policy (short\u2011term rate cuts) has become ineffective.\n\nBecause QE works through *interest\u2011rate, portfolio\u2011balance, credit\u2011creation* and *exchange\u2011rate* channels, its effects are felt unevenly across households, firms and wealth groups. Below is a synthesis of the most credible evidence (academic papers, central\u2011bank research, IMF/World Bank studies) together with a brief note on how solid each conclusion is.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

How QE moved the two key housing\u2011market variables  \n\n### 2.1 Mortgage rates (30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate)\n\n| Period | Average 30\u2011yr rate (percent) | Change vs. start of period | Primary driver identified in the literature |\n|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Pre\u2011QE (Jan\u202f2008)** | 6.03 | \u2013 | Fed funds rate still high (\u2248\u202f2\u202f%); credit spreads wide |\n| **After QE1 (Dec\u202f2009)** | 5.01 | **\u20111.02\u202fpp** | Yield\u2011curve channel: 10\u2011yr Treasury fell from 3.7\u202f% to 2.8\u202f% (\u2248\u202f90\u202fbp). The spread between Treasury and MBS narrowed, pushing mortgage rates down. |\n| **During QE2 (Oct\u202f2011)** | 4.40 | **\u20110.61\u202fpp** | Continued low long\u2011term yields; banks\u2019 funding costs fell as reserves rose. |\n| **During QE3 (Oct\u202f2013)** | 4.06 | **\u20110.34\u202fpp** | Additional MBS purchases directly lifted agency\u2011MBS prices, reducing mortgage\u2011rate risk premia. |\n| **Peak low (Oct\u202f2014, after QE3 ended)** | **3.87** | **\u20110.19\u202fpp** | Rate had already been on a downward trend, but QE kept the floor low. |\n\n**Key empirical finding** \u2013 *Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack (2011)* estimate that **each $1\u202ftn of QE lowered the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield by roughly 8\u201310\u202fbasis points**. Because the 30\u2011yr mortgage rate is about 1.5\u202fpp higher than the 10\u2011yr Treasury, the same $1\u202ftn of QE translates into a **12\u201315\u202fbp reduction in mortgage rates**. Over the full $3.9\u202ftn program, that is **\u2248\u202f45\u201360\u202fbp** \u2013 essentially the difference between a 5\u202f% and a 4.5\u202f% mortgage.\n\n### 2.2 House\u2011price index (HPI)\n\n| Year | S&P/Case\u2011Shiller U.S. National HPI (index, 2000=100) | % change YoY | QE\u2011related drivers |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| 2008 (pre\u2011crisis) | 146.4 | \u201312\u202f% (largest drop on record) | Credit crunch, foreclosures |\n| 2009 (first QE purchases) | 143.2 | **+2\u202f%** | Lower rates begin to revive demand |\n| 2010 (QE2 start) | 150.5 | **+5\u202f%** | Mortgage rates fall to 4.9\u202f% |\n| 2011 (mid\u2011QE2) | 155.7 | **+3\u202f%** | Home\u2011buyer sentiment improves |\n| 2012 (QE3 begins) | 164.9 | **+5.9\u202f%** | Mortgage rate hits",
