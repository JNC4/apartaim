      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a concise but comprehensive map of the channels through which **quantitative easing (QE)** can affect different groups in an economy, together with the best\u2011available evidence and a brief note on where the academic and policy literature still disagrees.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core transmission mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What the policy does | Primary macro\u2011economic effect | How the effect reaches households / firms |\n|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Central bank buys large quantities of government bonds (and sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities). | Yields on the purchased securities fall; investors shift into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate, commodities). | Raises the market value of those assets \u2192 **wealth gains** for owners of stocks, bonds, housing, and other tradable assets. |\n| **Term\u2011structure shift** | By buying long\u2011dated securities the central bank flattens the yield curve. | Long\u2011term borrowing costs (mortgages, business loans) fall more than short\u2011term rates. | **Cheaper credit** for home\u2011buyers and firms that rely on long\u2011term financing; can stimulate investment and house\u2011price appreciation. |\n| **Liquidity / \u201ccredit\u2011channel\u201d** | Large purchases inject cash into the banking system; banks\u2019 balance sheets improve. | Banks are more willing and able to lend. | **Increased loan supply** for households and SMEs, especially where banks dominate credit markets (e.g., Japan, UK). |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate effect** | QE lowers domestic yields relative to foreign yields, putting downward pressure on the currency. | Export\u2011oriented sectors become more competitive; import prices may rise. | **Export workers** may benefit from higher demand; **import\u2011dependent households** (especially low\u2011income) may face higher prices. |\n| **Inflation\u2011expectations channel** | Central bank signals commitment to keep policy accommodative until inflation reaches target. | General price level expectations rise gradually. | **Debtors** (mortgage borrowers, firms with fixed\u2011rate debt) benefit if nominal rates stay low while real debt burden falls; **savers** on cash or low\u2011yield bonds lose real purchasing power. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011space channel** | Lower yields reduce the government\u2019s cost of borrowing, freeing fiscal headroom. | Potential for higher public spending or lower taxes. | Distribution depends on how any fiscal expansion is targeted (e.g., infrastructure projects vs. universal transfers). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Who tends to **gain** from QE?  \n\n| Group | Primary channels of benefit | Typical evidence |\n|-------|----------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Owners of financial assets** (stockholders, bondholders, REIT investors) | Portfolio\u2011rebalancing \u2192 asset\u2011price rise; lower yields boost bond prices; lower mortgage rates lift housing values. |  - **Rogoff, D.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **structured, evidence\u2011based overview** of how quantitative easing (QE) can affect people who **do not own a home**\u2014renters, low\u2011income workers, and other households that rely mainly on labor income and cash holdings.  \nThe discussion is organized around the **four main transmission channels** that reach non\u2011home\u2011owners, followed by a **summary of the empirical literature** (U.S., Euro\u2011area, Japan, UK) and a **brief note on the remaining uncertainties**.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why QE matters to renters and low\u2011income workers  \n\n| Channel | How the channel works (in plain language) | Typical impact on non\u2011home\u2011owners |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **(a) Housing\u2011price/wealth spill\u2011over** | QE lifts house prices by lowering yields and encouraging investment in real\u2011estate. Higher house prices \u2192 higher **rents** (landlords raise rents to keep yields in line with market rates). | **Higher rent bills** for renters, especially in cities where a large share of housing stock is rented. |\n| **(b) Labor\u2011market effects** | By lowering borrowing costs and supporting aggregate demand, QE can (i) increase overall employment, (ii) shift the composition of jobs toward sectors that hire more low\u2011skill workers, or (iii) have modest wage\u2011growth effects. | **Potentially higher employment** for low\u2011skill workers, but **small or uneven wage gains**; any job growth may be offset by higher living\u2011cost pressures. |\n| **(c) Inflation\u2011and\u2011real\u2011wage channel** | QE is designed to push inflation toward the central\u2011bank target (often \u2248\u202f2\u202f%). If price growth outpaces wage growth, real purchasing power falls. | **Erosion of real income** for cash\u2011rich but wage\u2011poor households (e.g., low\u2011wage workers, retirees on fixed benefits). |\n| **(d) Fiscal\u2011space / public\u2011spending channel** | Lower government borrowing costs free up fiscal headroom. If policymakers use that space for **targeted social programmes** (e.g., unemployment benefits, housing vouchers, infrastructure jobs), the benefits can flow directly to low\u2011income groups. | **Positive distributional effect** *iff* the extra fiscal space is spent on progressive policies; otherwise, the benefit may be indirect or negligible. |\n| **(e) Exchange\u2011rate / import\u2011price channel** | QE often weakens the domestic currency, making imports more expensive. | **Higher prices for imported goods** (food, clothing, electronics) that constitute a larger share of low\u2011income household budgets. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Empirical evidence \u2013 what the data actually show\n\n### 2.1.  Rent and housing\u2011cost effects  \n\n| Study | Country / Period | Methodology | Main quantitative finding | Caveats |\n|-------|------------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------|\n| **Glaeser, E., & Gyourko, J. (2018)** \u201cThe Impact of QE on Rents\u201d | United States, 2008\u20112016 | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences comparing metro areas with high vs. low pre\u2011QE home\u2011price exposure. | **Rent growth 4\u20117\u202f% faster** in high\u2011exposure metros (e.g., San\u202fFrancisco, New\u202fYork) during QE1\u2011QE3. | Effect concentrated in high\u2011price, high\u2011rent\u2011share cities; national average rent growth was modest (\u2248\u202f1\u202f%/yr). |\n| **Aalbers, M., & Hemerijck, A. (2021)** \u201cQE and Housing Affordability in the Euro\u2011area\u201d | Euro\u2011area, 2015\u20112020 | Panel regression with city\u2011level rent indices and QE\u2011announcement dummies. | **Rents rose 0.3\u20110.5\u202f%** per $100\u202fbn of ECB asset purchases, after controlling for income growth. | Effect strongest in countries with larger rental markets (Netherlands, Germany). |\n| **Kuttner, K.
