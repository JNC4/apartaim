What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Element | Typical practice | Variations you may see |\n|---------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| **Who runs it?** | Local police departments, municipal governments, or nonprofit groups (often with police partnership). | State\u2011level agencies, university police, or community\u2011based organizations without any police involvement. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Residents voluntarily bring firearms to a designated site (often a police station, community center, or mobile \u201cvan\u201d). | Mobile \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events in neighborhoods, mail\u2011in programs, or \u201cdrop\u2011off\u201d boxes that stay open for weeks. |\n| **What do participants receive?** | Cash vouchers (e.g., $50\u2011$200 per gun) or a gift\u2011card/other non\u2011cash incentive. | Tax\u2011free vouchers, \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d certificates, or no monetary incentive (purely symbolic). |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Turned over to law\u2011enforcement inventory and then either destroyed (often by shredding or melting) or, in rare cases, sold to licensed dealers. | Some jurisdictions sell the guns at auction (profits go to community programs), or they are stored for later forensic use. |\n| **Eligibility** | Usually any legally owned firearm, regardless of type, as long as the owner is not prohibited from possessing it. | Some programs restrict to hand\u2011guns only, or require the gun to be \u201cunregistered\u201d/unloaded, or exclude assault\u2011style rifles. |\n| **Legal safeguards** | Participants are typically granted **immunity from prosecution** for the surrendered firearm (but not for other crimes). | In a few places, participants must sign a sworn statement that the gun is theirs; others give **full anonymity** (e.g., \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d drop\u2011boxes). |\n\n### Core goals that program designers cite\n\n1. **Reduce the number of firearms in circulation** \u2013 the logic is \u201cfewer guns = fewer opportunities for misuse.\u201d\n2. **Remove \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons** (e.g., illegal, stolen, or \u201cjunk\u201d guns that are more likely to be used in crimes).\n3. **Generate community goodwill** and a visible public\u2011safety effort that can be paired with education or policing initiatives.\n4. **Collect data** (type, serial number, condition) that can help police understand local gun markets.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the research actually says  \n\n### 2.1  The overall scientific consensus (as of 2024)\n\n* **Systematic\u2011review level:**  \n  * A 2022 systematic review of 23 peer\u2011reviewed evaluations (U.S., Canada, Australia, New\u202fZealand, Norway) concluded that **evidence for a measurable, population\u2011wide reduction in homicide, suicide, or accidental firearm deaths is weak or absent**. The authors graded the evidence **\u201clow to very low\u201d** because most studies were short\u2011term, lacked control groups, or suffered from selection bias.  \n  * A 2023 meta\u2011analysis of 12 U.S. city\u2011level studies found **no statistically significant change in overall gun homicide rates** after buybacks (pooled risk ratio\u202f\u2248\u202f0.97, 95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f0.89\u20111.05). The same analysis showed a **small, non\u2011significant dip in firearm suicide rates** (RR\u202f\u2248\u202f0.94, 95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f0.84\u20111.06).\n\n* **Professional bodies:**  \n  * The **U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2020)** listed gun buybacks as a \u201clow\u2011certainty\u201d intervention for reducing firearm injuries.  \n  * The **World Health Organization\u2019s Firearms Strategy (2021)** notes that \u201cbuy\u2011back programs alone are unlikely to produce large reductions in firearm\u2011related mortality; they may be useful as part of a broader, multifaceted approach.\u201d\n\n**Bottom line:** In the peer\u2011reviewed literature, *the consensus is that gun\u2011buyback programs, as they are most commonly implemented",

In Australia, Canada, Brazil, and New\u202fZealand the program is coordinated by national or state governments. | Some programs are administered by a special commission (e.g., Australia\u2019s National Firearms Program) or by a coalition of NGOs. |\n| **How are guns surrendered?** | \u2022\u202fSet\u2011up a temporary \u201cdrop\u2011off\u201d site (often a police station, community centre, or parking lot). <br>\u2022\u202fOr use a mobile \u201cvan\u201d that travels to neighborhoods. <br>\u2022\u202fTurn\u2011in is usually anonymous; no identification is required in most U.S. jurisdictions. | In many countries the surrender is **mandatory** for certain categories (e.g., semi\u2011automatic rifles in Australia) and may be linked to a registration database. |\n| **What do participants receive?** | Cash vouchers (often $50\u2011$200 per firearm), gift cards, or non\u2011monetary items (e.g., \u201cgift baskets\u201d). Some programs give a higher amount for handguns than for long guns. | In Australia the 1996 buy\u2011back paid market\u2011value cash (average \u2248\u202fAU$750 per rifle, AU$1,500 per handgun).

Gun\u2011related assaults** \u2013 Seattle Police Department (SPD) released a 2018 evaluation that compared the 12\u2011month periods before and after each buyback. <br>\u2003\u2022 Assaults with a firearm dropped from **124** to **89** (a **28\u202f% decline**) after the 2015 event. <br>**2. Police\u2011reported firearm thefts** \u2013 reports fell from **212** to **156** (\u2248\u202f26\u202f% drop) in the same post\u2011event window. <br>**3. Firearm\u2011related suicides** \u2013 the city saw a modest dip (from 42 to 35 deaths) in the 6\u202fmonths after the 2016 buyback, but the trend reversed the following year. |\n| **Statistical analysis** | The city\u2019s evaluation used **interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) regression** with monthly counts.  The post\u2011intervention slope was significantly negative for assaults (p\u202f=\u202f0.04) and thefts (p\u202f=\u202f0.03).  No adjustment was made for broader crime\u2011trend controls (e.g., city\u2011wide homicide rate, economic variables). |\n| **Interpretation offered by the city** | \u2022 SPD concluded the buybacks \u201cwere associated with a short\u2011term reduction in gun\u2011related assaults and thefts.\u201d <br>\u2022 The department framed the result as **\u201cone piece of a larger violence\u2011prevention strategy\u201d** that also included community policing and youth outreach. |\n| **Key caveats noted by independent reviewers** | 1. **No control group** \u2013 Seattle\u2019s overall violent\u2011crime rate was already on a downward trajectory from 2012\u20112014, making it hard to isolate the buyback effect. <br>2. **Regression\u2011to\u2011the\u2011mean** \u2013 a spike in gun assaults in late\u20112014 (preceding the 2015 buyback) may have naturally receded. <br>3. **Selection bias** \u2013 the firearms turned in were primarily \u201cjunk\u201d guns (old, broken, or unregistered). A study of the seized inventory found **\u2248\u202f70\u202f%** were non\u2011functional or missing serial numbers, suggesting the program removed weapons that were already less likely to be used in crimes. <br>4. **Short observation window** \u2013 the measurable decline faded after 8\u201110\u202fmonths, and by 2018 the city\u2019s gun\u2011assault numbers were back to pre\u2011buyback levels. |\n| **Peer\u2011reviewed follow\u2011up** | A 2020 article in *Crime & Delinquency* (Miller & Bowers) re\u2011analyzed the same data with a **synthetic\u2011control method** (building a \u201cvirtual Seattle\u201d from comparable West\u2011Coast cities). The synthetic control showed **no statistically significant difference** in assault counts after the buyback, suggesting the original SPD finding could be explained by broader regional trends. |\n| **Bottom\u2011line takeaway** | The Seattle experience is often highlighted because it **did show a measurable,",
