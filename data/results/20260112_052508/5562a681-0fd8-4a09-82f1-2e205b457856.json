      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to **raise overall economic efficiency** for the signatory countries, but the **distribution of the gains and losses across workers is uneven**.  In practice, some workers\u2014especially those in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011skill or productivity\u2011intensive sectors\u2014often see higher wages, more jobs and better career prospects, while others\u2014particularly those in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill or labor\u2011intensive industries\u2014can face job displacement, wage pressure, and a need for retraining.  The net effect for a country as a whole is usually modestly positive, but the adjustment process can be painful for affected workers unless complementary policies are in place.\n\nBelow is a balanced, evidence\u2011based overview that breaks the impacts down by **(1) sectoral effects, (2) skill level, (3) wage and employment outcomes, (4) labor\u2011standard provisions, and (5) the role of adjustment policies**.  Where the research is mixed or uncertain, that is noted.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Sectoral reallocation \u2013 \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d\n\n| Effect | What the evidence shows | Typical workers affected |\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Export expansion** | FTAs lower tariffs and non\u2011tariff barriers, making it cheaper for domestic firms to sell abroad.  Studies of NAFTA, the EU\u2019s single market, and the CPTPP find 5\u201115\u202f% increases in export volumes for participating industries (WTO 2020; OECD 2021). | Workers in export\u2011oriented sectors (e.g., automotive, aerospace, high\u2011tech, agriculture) often experience **job growth** and **wage gains** because firms can sell more and invest in higher\u2011productivity equipment. |\n| **Import competition** | The same tariff cuts expose domestic producers to cheaper foreign goods.  Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013) show that U.S. counties with higher exposure to Chinese import competition lost an average of 1.2\u202f% of manufacturing employment per year after 2000. | Workers in industries that compete directly with imports (e.g., textiles, apparel, low\u2011skill manufacturing, some services) are more likely to see **job losses** or **hour reductions**. |\n| **Industry\u2011wide productivity spillovers** | By forcing firms to adopt better technologies to stay competitive, FTAs can raise total factor productivity (TFP) across the economy (Baccini & Deardorff 2011). | Gains tend to be **diffuse**, eventually benefitting a broader labor force, but the timing is uneven. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** FTAs reallocate resources toward sectors where a country has a comparative advantage.  Workers in expanding sectors tend to benefit; those in contracting sectors bear the adjustment cost.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Skill level and wage differentials\n\n| Skill group | Typical impact | Evidence |\n|------------|----------------|----------|\n| **High\u2011skill, college\u2011educated** | **Positive**: higher demand for technical, managerial, and R&D talent; wages rise 2\u20118\u202f% on average in the decade after an FTA (OECD 2022). | Studies of the EU\u2011Mexico FTA and the EU\u2011South Korea FTA find that college\u2011educated workers see **larger wage gains** than low\u2011skill workers (Baldwin & Evenett 2020). |\n| **Medium\u2011skill (some post\u2011secondary, vocational)** | Mixed: gains in sectors that upgrade technology; possible losses if jobs are off\u2011shored to lower\u2011cost locations. | In Canada, the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) produced modest wage growth for medium\u2011skill workers in manufacturing, but the effect was not statistically significant (Statistics Canada 2023). |\n| **Low\u2011skill, routine\u2011task workers** | **Negative or neutral**",

The FTAs mainly *expanded* their market access rather than forcing a complete industry overhaul. | A 2015 IMF working paper shows that the elasticity of export growth to tariff reduction for Korean high\u2011tech goods was **\u2248\u202f0.8**, far higher than for low\u2011tech goods (\u2248\u202f0.2). |\n| **High baseline skill level** \u2013 Over 50\u202f% of the 20\u201129\u2011year\u2011old cohort held tertiary",
