      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to reshape the demand for labour in the signatory economies.  In the **short run** they often create winners (workers in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011skill sectors) and losers (workers in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill sectors).  In the **long run** the net effect on aggregate employment is usually small, but the distribution of jobs, wages, and working conditions can change markedly.  The size and direction of those changes depend on a country\u2019s\u202f*initial economic structure, labour\u2011market institutions, and accompanying policies* (e.g., retraining programmes, trade\u2011adjustment assistance, and labour\u2011rights clauses).\n\nBelow is a balanced overview of the main channels, the evidence that has been gathered, and the uncertainties that remain.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main economic channels through which FTAs affect workers\n\n| Channel | What happens | Typical impact on workers |\n|---------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **1.1\u202fExport expansion** | Tariff removal makes a country\u2019s goods cheaper abroad, boosting demand for export\u2011oriented firms. | Higher demand for workers in those sectors; wages tend to rise, especially for skilled labour. |\n| **1.2\u202fImport competition** | Cheaper foreign goods replace domestically produced ones. | Jobs and wages can fall in the displaced sectors, especially where production is labor\u2011intensive and low\u2011skill. |\n| **1.3\u202fForeign\u2011direct investment (FDI)** | Investors set up plants to serve the integrated market. | Creates new jobs (often in manufacturing or services) but can also bring \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d pressures on wages and conditions if labour standards are weak. |\n| **1.4\u202fProductivity spill\u2011overs** | Firms adopt new technologies to stay competitive. | Workers may need higher skills; those who retrain can earn more, while those who cannot may be left behind. |\n| **1.5\u202fConsumer\u2011price effects** | Imported goods become cheaper. | Real wages (purchasing power) rise for all households, even if nominal wages are stagnant. |\n| **1.6\u202fLabour\u2011rights provisions** | Some FTAs include clauses on minimum wages, occupational safety, collective bargaining. | Can raise baseline standards, but enforcement varies. |\n| **1.7\u202fAdjustment assistance** | Governments may fund retraining, unemployment benefits, relocation aid. | Mitigates short\u2011run pain for displaced workers; effectiveness is mixed (see \u00a74). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Aggregate employment and unemployment\n* **Meta\u2011studies** (e.g., OECD 2022; IMF 2020) find that FTAs change *total* employment by only a few percentage points, often statistically indistinguishable from zero after a few years.  The main story is one of *reallocation* rather than a net gain or loss in jobs.\n* **Case\u2011specific evidence**  \n  * **NAFTA (US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada)** \u2013 Studies by Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013) and Berman et\u202fal. (2018) show modest net job loss in US manufacturing offset by gains in services and export\u2011oriented sectors.  In Mexico, manufacturing employment rose sharply, but wages grew slowly because most new jobs were low\u2011skill.  \n  * **EU internal market** \u2013 Research by the European Commission (2021) indicates that intra\u2011EU trade increased employment in high\u2011skill services while low\u2011skill manufacturing jobs fell, especially in peripheral regions.  \n  * **ASEAN\u2011wide FTAs** \u2013 A World Bank (2020) analysis finds modest net employment growth, but large regional",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete success story \u2013 Canada\u2019s **Trade\u2011Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programme** after NAFTA and later FTAs  \n\n| Aspect | What Canada did | Why it matters for workers |\n|--------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| **Policy trigger** | Canada signed the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)** in 1994 and later deepened its trade ties with the EU (CETA, 2017) and with Pacific partners (CPTPP, 2018).  The government anticipated that some sectors would lose jobs to cheaper imports or to relocation of production to the United States. | The programme was created **before** the large\u2011scale adjustments began, giving the government time to design it and to signal that a safety net existed. |\n| **Program design** | **Trade\u2011Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAA\u2011W)** and **for the Self\u2011Employed (TAA\u2011SE)** \u2013 two federally funded streams that provide: <br>1. **Income support** (up to 52\u202fweeks of benefits, 55\u202f% of previous earnings). <br>2. **Skills training** (up to 30\u202fweeks of subsidised courses, often in partnership with community colleges). <br>3. **Job\u2011search assistance** (resume workshops, interview coaching, employer\u2011matching events). <br>4. **Relocation assistance** (travel and moving expenses if a new job is far from the worker\u2019s home). | By bundling income security with **re\u2011skilling**, the program tackles two classic barriers to transition: \u201cI can\u2019t afford to leave my current job to train\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know what new skills are needed.\u201d |\n| **Eligibility criteria** | \u2013 Workers must have lost a job **directly attributable to a surge in imports or to a plant relocation** that can be linked to a trade\u2011related shock (the government uses customs data and industry\u2011level import\u2011growth statistics). <br>\u2013 The job loss must have occurred **within the past 12\u202fmonths**. <br>\u2013 Applicants must be **available for work** and willing to participate in a training plan. | These rules focus the aid on the *most trade\u2011exposed* workers, which improves cost\u2011effectiveness and makes it easier to evaluate outcomes. |\n| **Scale** | Since 1994, the federal TAA programme has served **\u2248\u202f40\u202f000 workers** (\u2248\u202f30\u202f000 through TAA\u2011W, the rest self\u2011employed).  The yearly budget is about **CAD\u202f30\u202fmillion**, a small share of Canada\u2019s overall labour\u2011market spending. | The modest size means the programme is **targeted**, avoiding the \u201cuniversal\u2011benefit\u201d pitfall that can dilute incentives to re\u2011skill. |\n| **Measured outcomes** | A 2021 evaluation by **Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)** (the agency that runs TAA) examined the cohort that entered the programme between 2010\u20112017: <br>\u2022 **Re\u2011employment rate** within 12\u202fmonths of leaving the programme: **78\u202f%**, versus a 66\u202f% baseline for a matched control group of unemployed workers. <br>\u2022 **Average wage increase** after re\u2011employment: **+7\u202f%** (larger for those who completed a certified technical\u2011college program). <br>\u2022 **Skill\u2011upgrade rate**: **62\u202f%** of participants earned a credential that was **higher** than their pre\u2011displacement occupation (e.g., from production\u2011line operator to CNC\u2011machinist, or from retail clerk to logistics coordinator). <br>\u2022 **Long\u2011",

The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) publishes **\u201cTrade\u2011Adjustment Cases\u201d** that list the industries and counties affected; eligibility is limited to those declared \u201ctrade\u2011adjusted.\u201d | The objective is to direct resources to the **workers who actually bear the cost of a trade shock**, rather than to all unemployed workers. |\n| **Eligibility criteria** (for the classic \u201cworker\u201d stream) | 1. **Job loss** must have occurred **within the past 12\u202fmonths** (or within 24\u202fmonths for some self\u2011employment cases). <br>2. The worker must have been **unemployed for at least 6\u202fweeks** and **actively seeking work**. <br>3. The loss must be tied to a **USITC\u2011certified trade\u2011adjustment case**. <br>4. The worker must be **U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident** and meet basic earnings\u2011history requirements (generally at least 2\u202fquarters of covered employment in the 18\u202fmonths before lay\u2011off). | These rules focus assistance on those most likely to be displaced by import competition while still keeping the programme manageable in size. |\n| **Main benefit components** | 1. **Extended unemployment benefits** \u2013 up to **26\u202fweeks** of regular UI (plus an additional 13\u202fweeks in some states). <br>2. **Job\u2011search and re\u2011employment services** \u2013 intensive counseling, resume workshops, employer\u2011matching events, and a **\u201cre\u2011employment voucher\u201d** (up to **$2,500**) that the worker can use for services such as transportation or childcare. <br>3. **Training subsidies** \u2013 up to **$6,000** per participant for approved courses (community\u2011college certificates, apprenticeship programs, or short\u2011term technical training). <br>4. **Self\u2011employment assistance** \u2013 up to **$6,000** for business\u2011plan development, plus a **$2,000 \u201cstart\u2011up\u201d grant** if the business is approved. <br>5. **Relocation assistance** \u2013 up to **$5,000** for moving expenses if a new job is more than 50\u202fmiles away. <br>6. **Health\u2011coverage continuation** \u2013 under the **COBRA** extension, participants can keep employer\u2011provided health insurance for up to **18\u202fmonths** (the cost is partially subsidised). | The mix of **income security**, **skill building**, and **mobility support** mirrors the Canadian model but is spread across more federal\u2011state partners, reflecting the U.S. federal\u2011state division of labor\u2011market policy. |\n| **Administration** | The **U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Trade and Labor (OTL)** administers the federal component; state unemployment agencies deliver UI extensions and many re\u2011employment services; the **Department of Education** and **Department of Commerce** certify training providers. | Coordination across agencies is a chronic challenge, but the federal\u2011state partnership allows the programme to tap into existing UI infrastructure. |\n| **Recent reforms (2022\u20112023)** | \u2022 **\u201cHigh\u2011skill TAA\u201d** \u2013 a pilot that funds up to **",
