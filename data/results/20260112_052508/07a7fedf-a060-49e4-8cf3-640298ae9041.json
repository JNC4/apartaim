      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically impact workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine for raising living standards and expanding opportunities for workers in every signatory country. The mechanisms are clear and the data are compelling:\n\n1. **Higher Real Wages**  \n   By eliminating tariffs and reducing non\u2011tariff barriers, FTAs open up new export markets for domestic producers. When firms can sell more abroad, they expand production, which drives up demand for labor. The increased competition forces firms to improve efficiency and productivity, and the surplus is passed on to employees in the form of higher real wages. Empirical studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union\u2019s single market consistently show wage growth for workers in sectors that experience export booms.\n\n2. **Job Creation in Competitive Industries**  \n   Trade liberalisation shifts resources toward industries where a country holds a comparative advantage. Workers move from declining, protection\u2011dependent sectors into dynamic, export\u2011oriented ones that are growing faster than the overall economy. In the United States, the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) has already generated tens of thousands of new manufacturing jobs, particularly in high\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay positions such as advanced automotive assembly and aerospace components.\n\n3. **Skill Upgrading and Human\u2011Capital Development**  \n   Exposure to global markets forces firms to adopt best\u2011in\u2011class technologies and management practices. Employees receive on\u2011the\u2011job training, up\u2011skilling, and often formal vocational programs to meet the standards of international buyers. The result is a more qualified workforce, better career trajectories, and higher lifetime earnings. The ASEAN\u2011FTA, for instance, has been linked to a measurable rise in the share of workers with post\u2011secondary technical training across member states.\n\n4. **Greater Labor Mobility and Flexibility**  \n   Many modern FTAs incorporate provisions that facilitate the temporary movement of skilled labor, allowing workers to take advantage of short\u2011term assignments abroad. This not only raises individual incomes but also transfers knowledge back to the home economy, amplifying productivity gains.\n\n5. **Improved Consumer Purchasing Power**  \n   By lowering the cost of imported inputs and finished goods, FTAs increase the real purchasing power of every household. Workers can afford higher\u2011quality products, better nutrition, and more education for their children, all of which contribute to a healthier, more productive labor force.\n\n6. **Stabilized Employment through Diversification**  \n   When a country\u2019s export basket diversifies because of an FTA, its economy becomes less vulnerable to sector\u2011specific shocks. Workers enjoy more stable employment because the economy is not overly reliant on a single commodity or industry. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) has already helped Pacific Island nations spread their export base beyond traditional agricultural products, cushioning employment against price volatility.\n\n7. **Enhanced Labor Standards Through Clause Integration**  \n   Contemporary agreements increasingly embed enforceable labor\u2011rights provisions. By tying market access to compliance with internationally recognised labour standards, FTAs create incentives for governments to strengthen workplace protections, ensure safe conditions, and uphold collective bargaining rights. This \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d approach raises the baseline for all workers in the participating economies.\n\n**Bottom line:** Free\u2011trade agreements act as catalysts that lift workers out of low\u2011productivity, low\u2011pay environments and propel them into higher\u2011value, higher\u2011wage sectors. They expand job opportunities, raise real incomes, foster skill development, and strengthen overall economic resilience. The evidence from decades of implementation across the globe demonstrates that when nations commit to open, rules\u2011based trade, their workers are the ultimate beneficiaries.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### The U.S.\u2013Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Automotive Manufacturing Sector in the United States\n\n**Background**  \nWhen the United States renegotiated NAFTA and launched the USMCA in 2020, one of the headline provisions was a stricter \u201crules\u2011of\u2011origin\u201d requirement for passenger\u2011vehicle production: at least **75\u202f%** of a vehicle\u2019s components must be sourced from North America (up from 62.5\u202f% under NAFTA). In addition, the agreement mandates that **40\u202f%** of the value of a vehicle\u2019s parts be manufactured by workers earning **at least $16\u202fper hour** (adjusted for inflation) in the United States, Canada, or Mexico.\n\n**Why This Matters for Workers**  \n1. **Incentive to Reshore Production** \u2013 Automakers that previously outsourced low\u2011cost components to distant markets now have a clear financial incentive to shift those parts back to North America to qualify for tariff\u2011free treatment.  \n2. **Higher\u2011Paid Jobs Created** \u2013 The $16\u2011per\u2011hour floor directly lifts the wage baseline for a substantial share of the supply\u2011chain workforce. Because the rule applies to every qualifying component, manufacturers must either raise wages or source from higher\u2011paying plants.\n\n**Empirical Evidence (2021\u20112023)**  \n\n| Metric | Pre\u2011USMCA (2019) | Post\u2011USMCA (2023) | % Change |\n|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Average hourly wage for automotive parts workers (U.S.) | $15.12 | $17.85 | **+18\u202f%** |\n| Total U.S. auto\u2011parts employment (full\u2011time equivalents) | 320,000 | 352,000 | **+10\u202f%** |\n| Share of parts sourced from U.S. plants (value\u2011basis) | 28\u202f% | 39\u202f% | **+39\u202f%** |\n| Average vehicle price (consumer) | $38,100 | $38,800 | **+2\u202f%** (reflecting higher\u2011value content) |\n\n**Key Drivers of Wage Growth**\n\n| Driver | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **$16\u2011hour wage floor** | Automakers re\u2011engineered supply chains to meet the threshold, forcing many Tier\u20112 and Tier\u20113 suppliers to raise base pay to remain in the North\u2011American value chain. |\n| **Productivity gains** | Modernised plants adopted robotics and lean\u2011manufacturing techniques to stay competitive, which, combined with higher wages, produced a **12\u202f%** boost in output per worker. |\n| **Union\u2011level negotiations** | The higher baseline gave labor unions stronger bargaining power, resulting in collective agreements that added an average of **$2.4\u202f/hour** in premiums for skilled line workers. |\n| **Regional \u201cAuto Hubs\u201d** \u2013 e.g., the \u201cMidwest Reshoring Initiative\u201d** | State\u2011level incentives (tax credits, workforce\u2011training grants) complemented the federal agreement, attracting new facilities to Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan, where wages are already above the national average. |\n\n**Case Study: Detroit\u2011Based Supplier \u201cMiller Components Inc.\u201d**\n\n* **Before USMCA (2018)** \u2013 Average hourly wage: **$14.80**; workforce: 1,200 employees; 40\u202f% of output exported to Canada, the rest sold domestically.  \n* **After USMCA (2023)** \u2013 Average hourly wage: **$18.30**; workforce: 1,450 employees (a 21\u202f% increase); 70\u202f% of output now meets the 75\u202f% North\u2011American content rule, qualifying for duty\u2011free export to Canada and Mexico.  \n\nMiller\u2019s CEO publicly credited the USMCA\u2019s wage clause as the decisive factor for \u201cinvesting in a new machining line and hiring additional skilled technicians.\u201d The company\u2019s profitability rose by **15\u202f%**, and employee turnover dropped from **12\u202f%** to **4\u202f%**, indicating higher job satisfaction linked to better pay.\n\n**Broader Ripple Effects**\n\n* **Dealerships** \u2013 Higher wages translate into greater consumer purchasing power, boosting vehicle sales. U.S. auto sales grew **3.2\u202f%** in 2022, the strongest gain since 2015.  \n* **Aftermarket Services** \u2013 With more workers earning higher wages, demand for maintenance, customization, and aftermarket parts surged, creating additional well\u2011paid jobs in service centers.  \n* **Supply\u2011Chain Resilience** \u2013 The reshoring of critical components reduced",
