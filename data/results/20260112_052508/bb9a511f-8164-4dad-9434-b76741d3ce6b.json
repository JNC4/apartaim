      "unknown_model_response": "**Death rates per unit of electricity generated**\n\nWhen we compare the health impacts of different energy sources, the most reliable metric is the number of premature deaths (both direct and indirect) per terawatt\u2011hour (TWh) of electricity produced. Extensive epidemiological studies and life\u2011cycle assessments have quantified these rates for coal\u2011fired and nuclear power plants.\n\n| Energy source | Estimated deaths per TWh (including direct accidents, occupational hazards, and indirect health effects such as air\u2011pollution\u2011related disease) |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Coal**      | **\u2248\u202f20\u202f\u2013\u202f30 deaths/TWh** (most recent global averages fall around 24\u202fdeaths/TWh) |\n| **Nuclear**   | **\u2248\u202f0.05\u202f\u2013\u202f0.1 deaths/TWh** (global average \u2248\u202f0.07\u202fdeaths/TWh) |\n\n**Why the gap is so large**\n\n1. **Air\u2011pollution externalities** \u2013 Coal combustion releases particulate matter (PM\u2082.\u2085), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and hundreds of other toxic compounds. Long\u2011term exposure to these pollutants causes cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness, lung cancer, and premature death. The World Health Organization estimates that ambient air pollution accounts for roughly 4.2\u202fmillion premature deaths worldwide each year, and a substantial share of those are attributable to coal\u2011fired power.\n\n2. **Occupational hazards** \u2013 Coal mining is one of the most dangerous occupations. Miners face risks from roof collapses, explosions, and chronic lung disease (e.g., black lung). Even after the coal leaves the mine, workers at power plants are exposed to high\u2011temperature steam, heavy machinery, and hazardous chemicals.\n\n3. **Accident profile** \u2013 The most severe nuclear incidents (Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima) together resulted in a relatively small number of immediate fatalities (Chernobyl\u2019s immediate death toll is usually cited as 31). When the full life\u2011cycle, including long\u2011term cancer risk from radiation exposure, is accounted for, the total remains well under one death per TWh of electricity generated over many decades.\n\n4. **Lifecycle analysis** \u2013 Comprehensive life\u2011cycle assessments (including mining, construction, operation, and decommissioning) consistently show that nuclear\u2019s total mortality is an order of magnitude lower than coal\u2019s. For example, a 2018 study in *Environmental Research Letters* found that nuclear power\u2019s median mortality rate was **0.07\u202fdeaths/TWh**, while coal\u2019s",
