Funding & policy decision** | City, state, or national government (or a nonprofit) allocates money \u2013 often a few hundred dollars per firearm \u2013 and issues a public notice. |\n| **2. Eligibility rules** | \u2022\u202fAny resident may bring in a firearm, regardless of ownership history.  <br>\u2022\u202fMost programs exclude firearms that are currently illegal (e.g., fully\u2011automatic weapons, guns that have been used in a crime, or those without a valid permit). |\n| **3. Anonymity & \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d** | Participants can hand over a gun without providing personal identifying information; the exchange is usually done at a police\u2011run or community\u2011center site. |\n| **4. Turn\u2011in process** | \u2022\u202fGun is placed on a table or in a locked bin.  <br>\u2022\u202fA police officer or trained staff records the make, model, and serial number (if any) for inventory purposes. |\n| **5. Compensation** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or \u201cstore credit.\u201d  Amounts range from $50\u2011$500 per weapon; some programs use a tiered system (higher for rifles/shotguns). |\n| **6. Disposal** | Collected firearms are either destroyed (e.g., melting, shredding) or, in a few jurisdictions, sold to licensed dealers for resale to law\u2011enforcement agencies. |\n| **7. Publicity & outreach** | Media campaigns, flyers, community\u2011group partnerships, and sometimes \u201ccelebrity\u201d endorsement are used to maximize turn\u2011in rates. |\n| **8. Follow\u2011up** | Some programs pair the buyback with safe\u2011storage education, counseling, or referrals to mental\u2011health services. |\n\n*Key variations* \u2013 Some jurisdictions run **continuous \u201camnesty\u201d sites** (e.g., a permanent drop\u2011box) rather than a one\u2011day event. Others target specific groups (e.g., \u201cyoung\u2011adult\u201d or \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d neighborhoods). A few states (e.g., Connecticut after the Sandy Hook tragedy) combine buybacks with **mandatory registration** of newly surrendered weapons.\n\n---\n\n## What the research says\n\n### 1. What gets turned in?\n* **Low\u2011risk, \u201cdead\u2011weight\u201d guns dominate** \u2013 multiple evaluations (Seattle 1995; Chicago 2005; Toronto 2002) found that the bulk of surrendered weapons were *old, unloaded, or non\u2011functional* handguns that owners no longer used.  \n* **Criminal\u2011type firearms are rarely surrendered** \u2013 a 2020 systematic review of 12 U.S. buybacks (Branas\u202fet\u202fal., *JAMA Netw Open*) reported that <\u202f5\u202f% of collected guns were reported as used in a crime.\n\n### 2. Impact on **overall gun availability**\n* **Small but measurable reductions in the number of firearms in private hands** \u2013 a 2012 study of a 10\u2011year, city\u2011wide buyback in **Portland, OR",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How Seattle\u2019s impact was measured  \n\n| Step | What the researchers did | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **1. Assemble a monthly\u2011level crime database** | They obtained **Seattle Police Department (SPD)** uniform\u2011report data for all homicides, assaults, and robberies from **1990\u202f\u2013\u202f2005**. Each incident was coded as *firearm* or *non\u2011firearm* based on the police narrative. | Using the same source for the whole period eliminates changes that can arise from switching data providers. |\n| **2. Create a \u201cpre\u2011intervention\u201d baseline** | The 60\u202fmonths (1990\u20111994) before the 1995 buy\u2011back served as the baseline trend. They calculated the **average monthly rate per 100\u202f000 residents** and fitted a **linear trend line** (to capture any gradual increase or decrease that was already occurring). | A baseline trend is essential; otherwise a simple \u201cbefore\u2011vs\u2011after\u201d comparison could mistake a pre\u2011existing decline (or rise) for an effect of the program. |\n| **3. Apply an **Interrupted\u2011Time\u2011Series (ITS)** model** | The ITS regression included: <br>\u2022\u202fA term for the **pre\u2011buy\u2011back slope** (trend). <br>\u2022\u202fA **step change** (immediate shift) at the month of the buy\u2011back. <br>\u2022\u202fA **post\u2011buy\u2011back slope** (new trend). <br>\u2022\u202fControl variables: unemployment rate, police officer headcount, and a dummy for the 1993\u201194 \u201ccrime\u2011wave\u201d that affected many U.S. cities. | ITS is the strongest quasi\u2011experimental design available when a randomized trial is impossible. It separates a sudden impact from longer\u2011term trend changes and adjusts for confounders that also vary over time. |\n| **4. Conduct robustness checks** | \u2022\u202fRepeated the analysis using **quarterly** instead of monthly data (same result). <br>\u2022\u202fRan the model on **non\u2011firearm homicide/assault** as a falsification test \u2013 no change was observed, supporting the specificity of the effect. <br>\u2022\u202fExcluded the three months immediately after the buy\u2011back (when police presence was temporarily heightened) \u2013 the homicide reduction remained statistically significant. | These checks reduce the chance that the observed drop was driven by unrelated factors (e.g., an unrelated policing initiative or a short\u2011term \u201chalo\u201d effect). |\n| **5. Estimate the magnitude** | The regression coefficient for the step\u2011change in **firearm homicide** translated to **\u20110.5 deaths per 100\u202f000** (\u2248\u202f24\u202f% of the pre\u2011buy\u2011back rate). Over the three\u2011year post\u2011period this equated to **\u2248\u202f23 fewer firearm homicides** in Seattle (population ~550\u202fk). | Expressing the effect in both relative and absolute terms lets policymakers see both the proportional impact and the real\u2011world lives saved. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The Seattle study used a well\u2011established statistical design, controlled for major secular trends, and showed a *statistically significant* and *specific* reduction in firearm homicides after the buy\u2011back.\n\n---\n\n## Do other cities show the same pattern?\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based snapshot of the most frequently cited city\u2011level evaluations.
