      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nIn most empirical work, rent\u2011control (or \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d) policies raise the affordability of *existing* tenants in the short run, but they tend to make housing **less affordable for the broader market** over the longer horizon (10\u201130\u202fyears). The mechanism is a reduction in the *quantity* and *quality* of rental housing that the market supplies, which pushes up rents for units that are not under control and for new\u2011construction apartments. The size of the effect, however, depends heavily on **how the policy is designed**, the **pre\u2011existing market conditions**, and the **availability of alternative housing subsidies**.\n\nBelow is a structured, evidence\u2011based overview that separates what is fairly well\u2011established from what remains debated.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Expected long\u2011run outcome (ceteris paribus) |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** (rent ceiling below market rent) | Landlords receive less revenue per unit. | **Supply response:** fewer units built, more units withdrawn from the market (conversion to condos, demolition, or conversion to exempt uses). |\n| **Reduced marginal profit** | Lower current rent reduces the expected net present value (NPV) of future rent\u2011controlled units. | **Investment delay:** developers postpone or cancel new rental projects; existing owners postpone upgrades or maintenance. |\n| **\u201cVacancy decontrol\u201d / \u201cvacancy de\u2011regulation\u201d** | When a tenant leaves, the unit can be re\u2011rented at market price. | **Mitigates supply loss** but still creates a \u201clock\u2011in\u201d incentive for landlords to keep units occupied, potentially leading to *screening* and *selection* effects. |\n| **Indexing & periodic adjustments** | Rents are allowed to rise with inflation or a cost\u2011of\u2011living index. | **Reduces distortion** but still caps real rents below unrestricted market rates, so the supply\u2011side response persists, albeit weaker. |\n| **Exemptions for new construction** | New builds are not subject to controls for a set period (e.g., 10\u201115\u202fyears). | **Alters the distribution of effects:** newer, higher\u2011quality stock remains market\u2011rate, while older stock becomes \u201cprotected.\u201d Over time the protected stock ages, raising quality concerns. |\n| **Administrative costs & compliance risk** | Landlords must navigate paperwork, inspections, and possible penalties. | **Higher effective cost of renting**, which can discourage entry of marginal landlords and amplify supply constraints. |\n\n*Key takeaway:* The dominant channel is **the profit\u2011motivated supply response**\u2014fewer rental units are built or retained, and the existing stock may deteriorate. This pushes up *uncontrolled* rents, which outweighs the rent\u2011level benefit for tenants who stay in a controlled unit.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **single\u2011city case study** that is often quoted because it combines (a) a long\u2011standing rent\u2011control regime, (b) good\u2011quality longitudinal data, and (c) a clear contrast between \u201ccontrolled\u201d and \u201cuncontrolled\u201d market outcomes.  \n\nThe city is **San\u202fFrancisco, California (USA)**.  It has had a rent\u2011control ordinance in place since **1979**, with periodic amendments (most recently in 1994 and 2022).  The city\u2019s housing market is also one of the most data\u2011rich in the United States, thanks to the **U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS), the California Department of Housing & Community Development (HCD) building\u2011permit records, and the private \u201cZillow/Redfin\u201d rent\u2011tracking datasets** that are publicly archived.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the policy looks like in San\u202fFrancisco\n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Coverage** | All **pre\u20111979** rental units (\u2248\u202f73\u202f% of the total rental stock in 2020).  New construction is **exempt** for the first 15\u202fyears after completion. |\n| **Rent ceiling** | Rents may increase only by a **percentage set annually by the Rent Board** (average 2\u20113\u202f% per year in the 2000\u20112010 period, 1\u20112\u202f% in the 2010\u20112020 period).  The ceiling is **indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI)** and to a \u201cmaximum allowable return\u201d on the building\u2019s capital value. |\n| **Vacancy de\u2011control** | When a tenant vacates, the unit can be re\u2011rented at **market rate** (subject to a \u201cjust cause\u201d eviction rule).  However, the unit re\u2011enters the market **only after the previous tenant leaves**, which can be years later. |\n| **Administrative burden** | Landlords must file a **\u201crent increase petition\u201d** each year, pay a filing fee (\u2248\u202f$200), and disclose unit\u2011by\u2011unit rent histories.  Violations can lead to civil penalties of $5\u202f000\u2011$10\u202f000 per unit. |\n| **Exemptions** | Condominiums, single\u2011family homes, and units built after 1979 are **uncontrolled**.  \u201cAffordable\u2011housing\u201d units that receive city subsidies are also exempt from the ceiling (they are subject to separate affordability contracts). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What actually happened to rents and housing supply (1990\u20112022)\n\n### 2.1.

The **price gap widened from 12\u202f% to over 100\u202f%**, meaning that a newly built, market\u2011rate apartment in 2022 costs roughly **twice** as much as a comparable unit that has been under rent control for decades.\n\n### 2.2.

The basic profit\u2011maximization problem\n\nA landlord (or a corporate owner) decides how to use a parcel of land **today** and **in the future** by comparing the *expected present value* (PV) of each possible use.  \nThe two most common alternatives are:\n\n| Use | Revenue stream | Typical cost structure | Key risk/constraint |\n|-----|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| **Long\u2011term rental (subject to rent control)** | \u2022 Fixed rent that can rise only at a legislated rate (often 1\u20113\u202f%\u202f/\u202fyr) <br>\u2022 Low turnover revenue (because tenants stay longer) | \u2022 Operating & maintenance costs (often ~30\u201140\u202f% of rent) <br>\u2022 Property\u2011tax, insurance, financing costs | \u2022 **Revenue ceiling** limits ability to recoup capital improvements or market\u2011rate appreciation. |\n| **Condo/condominium conversion (or sale as a single\u2011family home)** | \u2022 One\u2011time sale price (or higher market\u2011rate rent if kept as a market\u2011rate apartment) | \u2022 Conversion costs (legal, architectural, permit fees, sometimes $30\u2011$70\u202fk per unit) <br>\u2022 Possible capital gains tax | \u2022 **One\u2011time cash inflow** can be many times the PV of a rent\u2011controlled stream, especially in high\u2011price markets. |\n\nThe decision rule is simple:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Convert if } \\; PV_{\\text{sale/market\u2011rate}} \\; > \\; PV_{\\text{rent\u2011controlled stream}} \\; - \\; \\text{(conversion cost + transaction costs)} .\n\\]\n\nBecause **rent\u2011controlled cash flows are capped**, the left\u2011hand side (sale price) often dominates once the building is old enough that the **remaining useful life** of the structure is limited.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Cost side \u2013 why conversion can be attractive\n\n| Cost component | Typical size (U.S. high\u2011cost metros) | Why it matters |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Financing cost** (interest on debt) | 4\u20116\u202f%\u202f/\u202fyr for a 30\u2011yr loan on a multifamily building | If a landlord cannot earn a spread between rent revenue and debt service, the property becomes \u201ccash\u2011flow negative.\u201d |\n| **Operating & maintenance (O&M)** | 30\u201145\u202f% of gross rent (higher for older buildings) | With low rents, O&M can consume most of the cash flow, leaving little net profit. |\n| **",
