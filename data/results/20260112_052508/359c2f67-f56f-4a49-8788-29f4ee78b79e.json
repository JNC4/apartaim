The goal is to let you see the full picture, not to tell you which choice is \u201cright.\u201d  Wherever possible I note the strength of the evidence (e.g., systematic review, randomized trial, surveillance data) and where uncertainties remain.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201craw\u201d and \u201cpasteurized\u201d actually mean\n\n| Term | Process | Typical temperature\u2011time combo | What is changed |\n|------|---------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Raw milk** | Milk taken directly from a healthy\u2011looking animal and **not** heat\u2011treated. May be filtered to remove large debris but no intentional heating. | \u2013 | All native microorganisms (both harmless and pathogenic) remain alive. |\n| **Pasteurization** | A heat\u2011treatment designed to **reduce** the load of disease\u2011causing bacteria while preserving most of the milk\u2019s flavor and nutritional qualities. | \u2022 **HTST** (High\u2011Temp/Short\u2011Time): 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for \u226515\u202fs (most common in the U.S.)  <br>\u2022 **LTLT** (Low\u2011Temp/Long\u2011Time): 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for \u226530\u202fmin (often used for specialty cheeses)  <br>\u2022 **UHT** (Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temp): 135\u2013140\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (produces shelf\u2011stable milk) | Most vegetative bacteria are killed; spores, some heat\u2011stable enzymes, and certain viruses may survive, but they are generally not the main cause of food\u2011borne illness. |\n\n*Key point*: Pasteurization is **not** a sterilization step; a tiny fraction of bacteria survives, but the overwhelming majority of known pathogens are destroyed.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The absolute number of raw\u2011milk\u2011related illnesses is small compared with the total burden of food\u2011borne disease, but the *rate per serving* is markedly higher.\n\n* **Relative risk**: Several case\u2011control studies (e.g., *Jensen et\u202fal., 2019, Clinical Infectious Diseases*; *Kumar et\u202fal., 2022, PLoS ONE*) estimate that consuming raw milk increases the odds of a gastrointestinal infection by **5\u201330\u202f\u00d7** compared with pasteurized milk, depending on the pathogen and the study design.\n\n* **Population\u2011specific risk**: Infants, the elderly, pregnant women, and",
