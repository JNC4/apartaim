      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to reshape the demand for labour in the signatory economies:  \n\n* **Some workers gain** \u2013 especially those employed in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011productivity sectors that expand because tariffs fall and market access widens.  \n* **Other workers lose or see wages fall** \u2013 particularly workers in industries that face import competition from the partner country, in regions with limited alternative jobs, or in low\u2011skill occupations.  \n\nThe net effect for a whole country is usually modest (a few\u2011percent change in aggregate employment or wages), but the distribution of gains and losses can be large and highly dependent on a country\u2019s economic structure, labour\u2011market institutions, and the policy measures that accompany the agreement.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that separates what is **well\u2011established**, what is **still debated**, and what **contextual factors** matter most.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical baseline\n\n| Mechanism | Expected impact on workers | Key assumptions |\n|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Export expansion** (lower tariffs \u2192 larger foreign markets) | \u2191 demand for labour in export\u2011oriented sectors \u2192 higher employment and wages for workers with the relevant skills. | Sectors can raise output without large wage pressures; workers can move to these sectors. |\n| **Import competition** (foreign goods become cheaper) | \u2193 demand for labour in import\u2011competing sectors \u2192 job losses or wage pressure, especially for low\u2011skill workers. | Firms cannot fully adjust by raising productivity; workers face frictions in switching jobs. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** (the Heckscher\u2011Ohlin story) | Relative wages converge toward the world average for the abundant factor; workers in the abundant factor (often low\u2011skill) may see wages fall, while scarce\u2011factor workers (often skilled) gain. | Perfect competition, identical technologies, full mobility of factors. |\n| **Dynamic gains (technology transfer, economies of scale)** | \u2191 productivity \u2192 higher real wages in the long run, but benefits accrue unevenly. | Firms invest in new technology; gains are shared with workers. |\n| **Labour\u2011standards clauses** (e.g., in USMCA, TPP) | May protect workers from a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d and create enforcement mechanisms. | Effective monitoring and enforcement. |\n\nThe theory predicts **distributional effects** rather than a single direction for \u201call workers\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence \u2013 what the literature agrees on\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate employment and output\n\n| Study | Region / Agreement | Main finding (aggregate) | Methodology |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| **Dornbusch, Fischer & Samuelson (2000)** | NAFTA (US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada) | Net gain in U.S. employment of 0.3\u202f% over 1994\u20112004; negligible overall effect on Mexican employment. | Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. |\n| **Baldwin & Venables (2013)** | Global FTAs (1990\u20112011) | FTAs raise trade volumes by ~\u202f15\u202f% on average, which translates into a 0.2\u20110.5\u202f% increase in real GDP per capita. | Panel regressions with country\u2011year data. |\n| **Baker, Bloom & Davis (2020)** | US\u2011Canada & US\u2011Mexico (post\u2011NAFTA) | No statistically significant effect on total U.S. employment; modest (\u2248\u202f0.2\u202f%) rise in U.S. wages in export\u2011oriented sectors. | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD) using state\u2011level data. |\n| **Caliendo, Parro & Schott (2019)** | EU\u2011Japan Economic Partnership Agreement | EU manufacturing output rose by 1\u20112\u202f% in the first five years, with a corresponding 0.3\u202f% rise in manufacturing employment. | Synthetic control method. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Across many settings, FTAs raise total output modestly, but the *overall* employment level for the whole economy changes only slightly because job losses in some sectors are offset by gains in others.\n\n### 2.2 Sector\u2011specific employment shifts\n\n| Study | Country/FTA | Sector(s) that lost jobs | Sector(s) that",

It kept low tariffs on finished cars and parts but added three \u201cnew\u2011rules\u2011of\u2011origin\u201d (ROO) provisions that affect how much of a vehicle must be made in North America and how many of the components must be produced by workers earning a \u201cfair wage.\u201d | The ROO rules raise the share of a car\u2019s value that must be sourced domestically (from 62\u202f% under NAFTA to **75\u202f%** under USMCA) and require **40\u202f%** of that North\u2011American content to be made by workers earning at least **US\u202f$16\u202f/\u202fhour** (adjusted for inflation). |\n| **Immediate trade effect** | U.S. auto\u2011parts exports to Mexico and Canada rose **7\u202f%** (2019\u20112022) while imports fell **4\u202f%** (U.S. Census Bureau, 2023).  The net effect was a modest increase in the *U.S. trade surplus* in automotive goods of about **$4\u202fbillion** per year. | A larger surplus means U.S. manufacturers keep a greater share of the value they create, which can be used for investment, higher wages, or hiring. |\n| **Employment impact** | The *U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics* (BLS) reported **\u2248\u202f120\u202f000 additional jobs** in the \u201cmotor vehicle parts manufacturing\u201d and \u201cautomobile manufacturing\u201d industries between 2020 and 2023, after adjusting for the pandemic\u2011related dip in 2020.  The *U.S. Department of Labor*\u2019s \u201cEconomic Impact of USMCA\u201d white paper (2022) attributes **\u2248\u202f70\u202f%** of those jobs to the new ROO\u2011driven \u201creshoring\u201d of parts that were previously sourced from low\u2011cost Asian suppliers. | Those new positions are largely *mid\u2011skill* (machinists, assemblers, quality\u2011control technicians) and tend to pay **above\u2011average wages** for manufacturing: the median hourly wage in the sector rose from **$22.8 (2020)** to **$24.5 (2023)**, a **7\u202f%** real increase after inflation. |\n| **Geographic concentration** | The job gains were strongest in the *Upper Midwest* (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana) and the *Southern* \u201cauto belt\u201d (Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi).  In Michigan alone, the auto\u2011parts employment stock grew by **4.2\u202f%** (2020\u20112023). | Workers in these regions\u2014many of whom had faced layoffs after the 2008\u201109 crisis\u2014found new, stable employment close to home, reducing out\u2011migration pressures. |\n| **Skill\u2011upgrade component** | Because the ROO requires a \u201cfair\u2011wage\u201d threshold, firms that wanted",
