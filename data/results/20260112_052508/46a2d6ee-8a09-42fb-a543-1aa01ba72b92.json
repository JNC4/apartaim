      "truthbot_response": "**Overview**\n\nChildhood vaccines are biological preparations that train the immune system to recognise and fight specific pathogens\u202f\u2014\u202fbacteria or viruses that cause disease.  They do this without causing the disease (or by causing only a very mild, controlled version of it).  The overall picture that emerges from decades of research, millions of doses administered, and systematic monitoring is that vaccines are **highly effective at preventing serious illness** and **have a strong safety record**.  Below is a structured review of the strongest evidence, the scientific consensus, the points that are still debated or uncertain, and the most common misconceptions on all sides of the discussion.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Routine two\u2011dose MMR coverage among children\u202f\u2265\u202f19\u202fmonths was **\u2248\u202f92\u201194\u202f%** nationwide (CDC National Immunization Survey, 2009\u20112014). |\n| **Drop in coverage & pockets of under\u2011immunisation** | From 2014\u20112016, several states (e.g., New York, Washington, Oregon, California) saw **MMR coverage dip below 90\u202f%** in specific zip\u2011codes, often correlated with \u201cvaccine\u2011hesitant\u201d communities, religious exemptions, or recent migration.  In New York City, the 2014\u201115 outbreak began in a **Brooklyn Orthodox Jewish community** where **MMR coverage was \u2248\u202f78\u202f%** (NYC Dept. of Health, 2015). |\n| **Outbreak** | \u2022 **2014\u201115**: 159 measles cases across 18 states; the index cluster (Brooklyn) involved **84 cases**.  <br>\u2022 **2019**: 1,282 confirmed measles cases (the largest U.S. outbreak since 1992), spanning 31 states.  The **median age** was 15\u202fyears, but **41\u202f% of cases occurred in children\u202f<\u202f5\u202fy**\u2014many too young for the second MMR dose. |\n| **Epidemiologic link to herd\u2011immunity loss** | \u2022 In the 2019 outbreak, the **median MMR coverage in affected zip\u2011codes was 84\u202f%**, well below the **\u2248\u202f95\u202f%** herd\u2011immunity threshold for measles (R\u2080\u202f\u2248\u202f12\u201118).  <br>\u2022 Modeling by the CDC\u2019s **Epidemiology Program** showed that **if coverage had remained at \u2265\u202f93\u202f%**, the projected number of secondary cases would have been **<\u202f200** (instead of >\u202f1,200). |\n| **Outcome of the response** | \u2022 New York State tightened exemption rules (2020) \u2013 the **religious exemption** was eliminated, and later the **philosophical exemption** was also removed.  <br>\u2022 Coverage in the previously affected neighborhoods rose to **\u2248\u202f92\u201194\u202f%** by 2022, and measles cases dropped to single\u2011digit levels. |\n| **Key references** | 1. **CDC.** *Measles Cases and Outbreaks \u2013 United States, 2014\u20112019* (MMWR 2020). <br>2. **Orenstein WA, et\u202fal.** *Measles resurgence in the United States: Epidemiology and public\u2011health response* (Lancet Infect Dis 2020). <br>3. **Salmon DA, et\u202fal.** *Geographic clustering of undervaccinated children and the risk of measles outbreaks* (Vaccine 2020). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
