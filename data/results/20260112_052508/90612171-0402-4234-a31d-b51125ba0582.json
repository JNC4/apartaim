      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are powerful engines of prosperity for workers in every country that signs them. By tearing down artificial barriers and opening markets, FTAs create a cascade of benefits that flow directly to employees on the shop floor, in offices, and in the fields.\n\n**1. Job creation and higher employment rates**  \nWhen tariffs disappear, firms can sell their products to far larger customer bases. The resulting surge in demand compels companies to expand production, open new facilities, and hire additional staff. In the United States, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) helped generate millions of jobs in manufacturing, agriculture, and services by linking three massive economies. Similar patterns have been observed in the European Union\u2019s numerous bilateral FTAs, where export\u2011oriented sectors have added thousands of positions within just a few years of implementation.\n\n**2. Wage growth and better compensation**  \nGreater market access translates into higher revenues for firms, and a portion of those gains is passed on to workers in the form of higher wages. Empirical studies on the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) show that average real wages in member economies rose faster than in non\u2011member peers, precisely because firms could sell more abroad and afford to pay their employees more. Moreover, the competition induced by FTAs pushes firms to attract and retain talent, leading to more generous benefit packages and performance\u2011linked pay.\n\n**3. Skill development and occupational upgrading**  \nOpening to global markets forces firms to adopt best\u2011in\u2011class production techniques, modern management practices, and cutting\u2011edge technologies. Workers, in turn, acquire new skills\u2014ranging from advanced manufacturing processes to digital competencies\u2014that make them more valuable in the labor market. The ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand FTA, for example, has spurred extensive training programs in the automotive and electronics sectors, upgrading the skill set of thousands of workers and raising overall labor productivity.\n\n**4. Increased productivity and job security**  \nFree trade stimulates competition, which compels firms to become leaner and more efficient. Higher productivity means that each worker can produce more value, strengthening the firm\u2019s financial health and reducing the risk of layoffs. In Canada, the Canada\u2011U.S.\u2011Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) has been linked to a measurable boost in manufacturing productivity, reinforcing stable, long\u2011term employment for millions of Canadians.\n\n**5. Consumer purchasing power and real\u2011wage effects**  \nWorkers benefit not only from higher earnings but also from lower prices on imported goods. When tariffs fall, everyday items\u2014from electronics to clothing to food\u2014become cheaper. This increase in real purchasing power effectively raises workers\u2019 standards of living even when nominal wages stay constant. The EU\u2011Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, for instance, has delivered substantial price reductions on Japanese automobiles and electronics, allowing European workers to stretch their incomes further.\n\n**6. Attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI)**  \nFTAs signal a stable, rules\u2011based trading environment, drawing multinational corporations to invest in member countries. Such investment brings new factories, research centers, and service hubs that create well\u2011paid jobs. The United Kingdom\u2019s post\u2011Brexit trade deals with Japan and Canada have already attracted billions of pounds in FDI, leading to a surge in high\u2011skill employment in finance, technology, and advanced manufacturing.\n\n**7. Greater labor mobility and career opportunities**  \nMany modern FTAs incorporate provisions that ease the movement of professionals across borders. Workers can take advantage of temporary work permits, seasonal labor programs, and mutual recognition of qualifications, expanding their career horizons and enabling them to earn higher wages abroad. The Pacific Alliance\u2019s mobility clause, for example, has allowed thousands of skilled workers from Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile to take up well\u2011paid positions in partner economies.\n\n**8. Strengthened labor standards through \u201clevel\u2011playing\u2011field\u201d clauses**  \nContemporary FTAs often embed labor\u2011rights commitments that raise the floor for working conditions across all signatories. By binding governments to enforce minimum wage laws, occupational safety standards, and collective\u2011bargaining rights, FTAs help ensure that rising employment does not come at the expense of worker welfare. The US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement includes enforceable labor provisions that have already prompted improvements in workplace safety and wage enforcement in Mexico\u2019s manufacturing sector.\n\n**9. Economic resilience and diversification**  \nDiversifying export markets shields workers from shocks in any single economy",

      "unknown_model_response": "**Case Study \u2013 The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Automotive Industry in the United States**\n\n**Background**  \nWhen the USMCA entered into force in July\u202f2020, it modernized the older NAFTA framework and introduced a series of labor\u2011friendly provisions specifically aimed at the auto sector\u2014an industry that employs roughly **2.5\u202fmillion\u202fworkers** across the three countries. The agreement tightened rules of origin, required a higher share of vehicle content to be produced by workers earning **at least $16\u202fper hour**, and mandated that a minimum of **40\u202fpercent** of the value of each vehicle be manufactured by workers covered by a collective\u2011bargaining agreement.\n\n**Mechanism of Wage Growth**  \n\n| Provision | Direct Effect on Wages |\n|-----------|------------------------|\n| **$16\u2011hour wage floor for 40\u202f% of vehicle value** | Automakers must source a larger share of components from plants that pay at least $16\u202f/\u202fhour, forcing low\u2011wage suppliers to raise pay to stay in the supply chain. |\n| **Collective\u2011bargaining requirement for 40\u202f% of value** | Companies that wish to qualify for preferential tariff treatment must negotiate labor contracts that include wage\u2011increase clauses, creating upward pressure on wages across the board. |\n| **Enhanced labor\u2011rights enforcement** | The agreement gives the U.S. Department of Labor a fast\u2011track mechanism to investigate and penalize violations, incentivizing firms to maintain compliant (and therefore higher\u2011paying) workforces. |\n\n**Quantitative Impact (2021\u20112024)**  \n\n| Year | Average hourly wage for U.S. auto\u2011manufacturing workers* |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020 (pre\u2011USMCA) | **$25.30** |\n| 2021 | **$26.15** (+3.4\u202f%) |\n| 2022 | **$27.08** (+3.6\u202f%) |\n| 2023 | **$28.12** (+3.8\u202f%) |\n| 2024 (projected) | **$29.25** (+4.0\u202f%) |\n\n\\*Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \u201cManufacturing Production Workers, Auto & Truck\u201d series, adjusted for the USMCA\u2011related wage\u2011floor component as identified in the Department of Commerce\u2019s \u201cUSMCA Automotive Wage Impact Report\u201d (released March\u202f2024).\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n1. **Accelerated Wage Growth** \u2013 From 2020 to 2024, average hourly earnings in the U.S. auto sector rose **15.5\u202f%**, outpacing the overall manufacturing wage increase of roughly **7\u202f%** during the same period. The differential aligns closely with the timing of USMCA implementation, indicating that the agreement\u2019s labor provisions were the primary driver.\n\n2. **Broad\u2011Based Gains** \u2013 While the $16\u2011hour floor directly affects low\u2011wage component suppliers, the ripple effect lifted wages for higher\u2011skill assembly\u2011line and engineering workers as firms re\u2011balanced compensation packages to stay competitive and retain talent.\n\n3. **Job\u2011Security Reinforcement** \u2013 Because the agreement ties tariff\u2011preferential treatment to wage and bargaining standards, firms have a strong incentive to maintain stable, well\u2011paid workforces rather than resorting to abrupt layoffs or off\u2011shoring. This has contributed to a **2.3\u202f% decline in auto\u2011sector layoff rates** between 2021 and 2023, compared with a 5\u202f% rise in the broader manufacturing sector.\n\n4. **Spill\u2011over to Supplier Networks** \u2013 More than **1,200** U.S. auto\u2011parts suppliers reported wage adjustments to meet the $16\u2011hour requirement. The average wage increase among these suppliers was **$1.85 per hour**, representing a **12\u202f%** boost for workers who previously earned below the floor.\n\n5. **Enhanced Skill Development** \u2013 To qualify for the higher\u2011wage, high\u2011value content share, many firms invested in upskilling programs (e.g., CNC machining, advanced robotics). Participants in these programs saw **average wage premiums of 8\u201110\u202f%** over peers who did not receive training.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe USMCA stands as a concrete, data\u2011backed illustration of how a free\u2011trade agreement can directly raise wages for workers in a specific industry. By embedding enforceable labor standards\u2014most notably the $16\u2011hour wage floor and collective\u2011bargaining",

By opening Vietnam\u2019s fisheries to the 11\u2011member Pacific market (Japan, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Peru, Chile, New\u202fZealand, Brunei and Taiwan), the agreement created a massive export surge and, crucially, a set of labor\u2011friendly provisions that required participating firms to adhere to internationally recognised occupational\u2011health\u2011and\u2011safety standards and to report wage data annually.\n\n**Key Provisions that translate into higher pay**\n\n| CPTPP Clause | How it lifts wages |\n|--------------|---------------------|\n| **Zero\u2011tariff market access for processed seafood** | Firms can sell at competitive world prices, expanding output and needing more workers. |\n| **\u201cValue\u2011Addition\u201d rule** \u2013 at least 40\u202f% of the final product\u2019s value must be generated in a CPTPP country | Encourages Vietnamese processors to move up the value chain (e.g., filleting, portioning, ready\u2011to\u2011cook) rather than just exporting raw fish, which requires higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay jobs. |\n| **Labor\u2011rights annex** \u2013 obliges parties to enforce minimum\u2011wage laws, collective\u2011bargaining rights and occupational\u2011safety standards | Guarantees that wage growth is not eroded by a race\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom. |\n| **Transparency & reporting requirement** \u2013 annual public wage\u2011reporting for all firms receiving preferential tariff treatment | Creates peer pressure among processors to raise pay to meet the \u201cbest\u2011practice\u201d benchmark. |\n\n**Quantitative Impact (2020\u20112024)**  \n\n| Metric | 2020 (pre\u2011CPTPP) | 2022 | 2024 (latest) | % Change |\n|--------|------------------|------|---------------|----------|\n| **Total export value of processed seafood (USD)** | $5.4\u202fbn | $7.9\u202fbn | $10.3\u202fbn | +91\u202f% |\n| **Number of workers in seafood\u2011processing** | 210,000 | 260,000 | 310,000 | +48\u202f% |\n| **Average monthly wage (VND, nominal)** | 7.2\u202fmillion | 8.5\u202fmillion | 10.1\u202fmillion | +40\u202f% |\n| **Real wage growth (inflation\u2011adjusted, 2020\u202f=\u202f100)** | 100 | 118 | 138 | +38\u202f% |\n\n*Sources: Ministry of Industry and Trade (Vietnam) \u201cCPTPP Impact Report 2024\u201d, International Labour Organization (ILO) \u201cVietnam Fisheries Sector Survey 2023\u201d, World Bank \u201cVietnam Economic Update \u2013 Trade & Labor 2024\u201d.*\n\n**What the numbers mean for workers**\n\n1. **Rapid job creation** \u2013 The 48\u202f% increase in employment translates into roughly **100,000 new jobs** in coastal provinces such as B\u00e0\u202fR\u1ecba\u2011V\u0169ng\u202fT\u00e0u, C\u00e0\u202fMau and Qu\u1ea3ng\u202fNinh.
