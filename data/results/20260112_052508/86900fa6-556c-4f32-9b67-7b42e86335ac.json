      "unknown_model_response": "**Safety differences between raw milk and pasteurized milk**\n\n| Aspect | Raw Milk | Pasteurized Milk |\n|--------|----------|-------------------|\n| **Pathogen load** | Because it has not been heat\u2011treated, raw milk can contain a variety of bacteria, including *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, and *Campylobacter*. The presence and concentration of these organisms depend on the health of the herd, milking hygiene, and storage conditions. | Pasteurization (typically 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fseconds in the high\u2011temperature short\u2011time method) is designed to kill the vast majority of pathogenic bacteria. Properly pasteurized milk should contain \u2264\u202f10\u202fCFU/mL of total coliforms and be free of the major food\u2011borne pathogens. |\n| **Shelf life** | Raw milk is more perishable; it begins to spoil within a few days of milking, even when kept refrigerated at 4\u202f\u00b0C. Spoilage bacteria (e.g., lactic acid bacteria) can proliferate quickly, leading to off\u2011flavors and curdling. | Pasteurization reduces the initial microbial load, extending shelf life to 2\u20113 weeks (or longer with ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature processing). The lower bacterial count also delays the onset of spoilage. |\n| **Enzyme and nutrient retention** | Because it is not heat\u2011treated, raw milk retains all of its native enzymes (e.g., lipase, lactoperoxidase) and heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin C, some B\u2011vitamins). Some people argue these components may aid digestion and immune function. | The heat of pasteurization inactivates certain enzymes (especially lipase) and can cause modest losses of heat\u2011sensitive nutrients. However, the majority of milk\u2019s protein, calcium, and vitamin D content remains intact. |\n| **Regulatory oversight** | In many jurisdictions, raw milk sales are restricted or prohibited because of the higher risk of food\u2011borne illness. When raw milk is sold, it is",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a well\u2011documented example of a food\u2011borne illness outbreak that was traced back to raw (unpasteurised) milk, along with an explanation of how pasteurisation eliminates the same risk.\n\n---\n\n### Outbreak Example: 2007 Pennsylvania Raw\u2011Milk *Campylobacter* Outbreak  \n\n| Detail | Information |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Date** | July\u202f2007 |\n| **Location** | Several counties in Pennsylvania, USA |\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* |\n| **Number of cases** | 12 confirmed illnesses (8 children, 4 adults) |\n| **Source of contamination** | Raw milk sold directly by a farm (farm\u2011gate sales) that did not undergo any heat treatment. |\n| **Investigation findings** | - The *Campylobacter* strain isolated from patients matched the strain found in the raw milk sample.<br>- The farm\u2019s milking equipment and storage tanks showed inadequate sanitation and temperature control, creating a favorable environment for the bacteria. |\n| **Public\u2011health outcome** | Patients experienced severe gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever). One child required hospitalization for dehydration. The outbreak prompted a state\u2011wide recall of the raw\u2011milk product and reinforced stricter enforcement of raw\u2011milk sales regulations. |\n\n---\n\n### How Pasteurisation Prevents This Same Situation  \n\n1. **Heat\u2011kill step**  \n   *Standard high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurisation* heats milk to **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds**. This thermal treatment reliably kills >\u202f99.999% of *Campylobacter* cells, as well as other common pathogens such as *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, and *Listeria monocytogenes*.\n\n2. **Reduction of bacterial load**  \n   Even if a herd carries low\u2011level contamination, the heat process reduces the total viable bacterial count to a level that is considered safe for consumption. In the Pennsylvania case, the raw milk contained enough *Campylobacter* to cause illness; pasteurisation would have reduced that load to below the infectious dose.\n\n3. **Extended safety margin**  \n   Pasteurised milk is typically stored at refrigeration temperatures (\u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C) for several weeks. The lower initial microbial load means that any post\u2011process contamination (e.g., from handling) has a much smaller chance of reaching harmful levels, whereas raw milk starts with a higher baseline count.\n\n4. **Regulatory safeguards**  \n   Commercial pasteurisation plants are subject to routine microbial testing (e.g., for total coliforms, *E.\u202fcoli*, and specific pathogens) before the product can be released. This systematic monitoring catches problems early, whereas raw\u2011milk sales often lack such oversight.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line  \n\nThe 2007 Pennsylvania outbreak illustrates how pathogenic bacteria present in raw milk can lead to real illness when the milk is",
