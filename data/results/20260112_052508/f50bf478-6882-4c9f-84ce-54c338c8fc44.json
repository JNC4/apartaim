      "unknown_model_response": "**The short answer**\n\n> The bulk of credible empirical research finds **no robust, statistically\u2011significant evidence that the death penalty deters homicide (or other \u201cserious\u201d crimes) more effectively than life imprisonment without parole**.  Where a deterrent effect is reported, it is usually small, highly sensitive to modelling choices, and often disappears once the analysis controls for a fuller set of confounding factors.\n\nBelow is a systematic walk\u2011through of the evidence, the arguments that scholars and policymakers make on each side, where the scientific community largely agrees, and where genuine uncertainty still remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why the question matters \u2013 the theoretical backdrop\n\n| Concept | How it relates to the death\u2011penalty debate |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **General deterrence** | The idea that *anyone* will refrain from committing a crime because the expected cost (probability\u202f\u00d7\u202fseverity of punishment) is high. |\n| **Specific deterrence** | The idea that a particular offender will be discouraged from re\u2011offending after experiencing a harsh sanction. |\n| **Rational\u2011choice model** | Assumes potential offenders weigh *certainty* of being caught and *severity* of the sanction.  Empirical work consistently shows **certainty** matters far more than severity. |\n| **Marginal deterrence** | The incremental effect of moving from life\u2011without\u2011parole (LWOP) to death.  The question you asked is precisely about this marginal effect. |\n\nIf the death penalty were a strong deterrent, we would expect to see lower homicide (or other violent\u2011crime) rates in jurisdictions that **use** it compared with those that **do not**, after controlling for everything else that influences crime (poverty, policing, gun availability, demographics, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The material is organized so you can see:\n\n1. **What the bulk of the evidence shows** (the scholarly consensus).  \n2. **The strongest studies that reach the opposite conclusion** (and why they are contentious).  \n3. **Key methodological points that shape every interpretation** (what is robust, what is uncertain).  \n4. **Evidence that is often missed or under\u2011reported** (e.g., non\u2011U.S. data, \u201ccertainty\u2011of\u2011punishment\u201d findings).  \n5. **Common misconceptions** that appear on both sides of the debate.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.

By constructing a *probability of execution* measure, the authors could ask: *If a death sentence is almost always carried out, does homicide fall more than when the sentence is rarely executed?* At the same time, the model retains a \u201cseverity\u201d indicator to test the marginal effect of the death\u2011penalty statute itself.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The goal is to show what the data actually say, how the studies were built, and why the results matter for the broader deterrence debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why \u201ccertainty\u201d matters in deterrence theory  \n\n| Concept | Classic formulation (Becker\u202f1968; Ehrlich\u202f1973) |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Expected cost of crime** = *Probability of detection* \u00d7 *Probability of conviction* \u00d7 *Severity of sanction* | If any one of the three factors is near zero, the expected cost is low, and rational actors (or \u201cbounded\u2011rational\u201d actors) are less likely to be deterred. |\n| **Policy implication** | Raising *certainty* (e.g., faster investigations, higher conviction rates) can be more cost\u2011effective than making the punishment harsher. |\n\nEmpirical research that can separate these three \u201cpillars\u201d is rare because they are tightly correlated in real\u2011world data (states that have many executions often also have aggressive policing, etc.).

Monthly homicide counts (\u2248\u202f2\u202f500 observations). |\n| **Key variables** | 1. **Execution rate** \u2013 number of executions per 1\u202fmillion residents in a state\u2011year.<br>2. **Execution\u2011certainty index** \u2013 the *probability that a murder conviction leads to an execution* (computed as executions \u00f7 murder convictions).<br>3. **Life\u2011sentence certainty** \u2013 proportion of murder convictions that resulted in LWOP.<br>4. **Police\u2011detection rate** \u2013 proportion of homicides solved (clearance rate). |\n| **Statistical approach** | Fixed\u2011effects Poisson regression with state and year dummies; lagged independent variables (1\u2011month, 3\u2011month, 12\u2011month lags) to capture delayed deterrent effects. |\n| **Main finding** | **Execution certainty**, not the *raw number* of executions, had a statistically significant negative association with subsequent homicide rates: a **10\u2011percentage\u2011point increase in the probability that a convicted murderer is executed** lowered the homicide rate by about **3\u202f%** (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

      "unknown_model_response": "### 1.  How \u201cexecution certainty\u201d (the *probability of execution*) is calculated  \n\n| Step | What you need | Formula |\n|------|---------------|---------|\n| **(a) Count the death\u2011sentences handed down in a given year** | `DS\u209c` = number of defendants who received a *death* sentence that year (not just a capital\u2011case filing). | \u2014 |\n| **(b) Count the executions that actually took place that same year** | `EX\u209c` = number of inmates who were *executed* that year. (If an execution is carried out in a later year, it is counted in the year it occurs; the denominator stays the same.) | \u2014 |\n| **(c) Divide** | `PE\u209c = EX\u209c / DS\u209c` | This yields a **probability** that a condemned person will be put to death, *conditional on having already received a death sentence*.  The value ranges from 0 (no death sentences ever lead to execution) to 1 (every death sentence is carried out). |\n\nBecause the denominator (`DS\u209c`) is often **very small**\u2014especially in states that rarely hand out death sentences\u2014the resulting probability can swing dramatically from one year to the next.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Concrete example: a \u201clow\u2011execution\u201d state  \n\nLet\u2019s use **New Mexico** (which abolished the death penalty in 2009, but before that it issued only a handful of death sentences and executions). Imagine the year **1999**, a typical \u201clow\u2011execution\u201d year for the state.\n\n| Year | Death sentences (`DS\u209c`) | Executions (`EX\u209c`) | Raw probability `PE\u209c` |\n|------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| 1999 | 2 | 0 | 0 / 2 = **0.00** (0\u202f%) |\n| 2000 | 3 | 1 | 1 / 3 = **0.33** (33\u202f%) |\n| 2001 | 1 | 0 | 0 / 1 = **0.00** (0\u202f%) |\n| 2002 | 2 | 0 | 0 / 2 = **0.00** (0\u202f%) |\n| 2003 | 4 | 1 | 1 / 4 = **0.25** (25\u202f%) |\n\n**What does a \u201c10\u2011point increase\u201d look like here?**\n\n* A **10\u2011point increase** means the probability rises by **0.10** (10\u202fpercentage\u2011points).  \n* In a year with **4 death sentences**, a 10\u2011point rise would be from 0.25 \u2192 0.35, which mathematically requires **one additional execution** (because 1/4\u202f=\u202f0.25, 2/4\u202f=\u202f0.50; the next feasible probability after 0.25 is 0.50, a 25\u2011point jump).  \n* In a year with **10 death sentences**, a 10\u2011point rise would be from 0.20 \u2192 0.30, i.e., **one extra execution** (2/10\u202f=\u202f0.20 \u2192 3/10\u202f=\u202f0.30).  \n\nThus, **in low\u2011execution states a single extra execution can represent a 10\u2011point (or larger) change** in the measured probability.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Smoothing the series \u2013 why researchers often use multi\u2011year averages  \n\nBecause a single year\u2019s numerator can be zero (no executions) while the denominator is non\u2011zero, the raw `PE\u209c` series looks \u201cspiky.\u201d To obtain a more stable estimate of *certainty* that reflects the **policy environment** rather than random yearly noise,",
