      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that try to change a target country\u2019s behavior by restricting its access to goods, finance, technology, or diplomatic engagement.**  \nWhether they succeed depends on a mixture of political, economic, and strategic factors. Below is a structured overview that brings together the main mechanisms, the empirical evidence that supports them, and the major points of disagreement among scholars and practitioners.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic causal chain\n\n| Step | What it means | Typical evidence |\n|------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **a. Imposition** | A sanction\u2011issuing actor (often a state or a coalition such as the EU, US, UN) announces a restriction \u2013 e.g., an export ban on weapons, a freeze of sovereign assets, or a secondary\u2011sanctions rule that penalizes third\u2011party firms that do business with the target. | Legal texts (e.g., US\u202fExecutive Orders, UN Security\u2011Council Resolutions) and accompanying diplomatic statements. |\n| **b. Economic shock** | The target experiences a measurable change in trade flows, capital access, or cost of imported inputs. | Trade\u2011data drops (e.g., a 30\u202f% fall in Iranian oil exports after 2012 EU sanctions); higher borrowing costs; loss of foreign\u2011direct investment. |\n| **c. Political pressure** | The economic shock translates into internal or external political costs for the leadership (reduced fiscal space, elite dissent, public unrest). | Budget deficits, inflation spikes, elite defections reported in news or leaked diplomatic cables. |\n| **d. Decision point** | The leadership can (i) comply with the sanction\u2019s demand, (ii) seek a compromise, (iii) double\u2011down and look for workarounds, or (iv) face regime change. | Policy shifts (e.g., North\u202fKorea\u2019s 2018 diplomatic overtures), negotiated agreements (Iran nuclear deal), or continued defiance (Venezuela). |\n\nThe chain is *probabilistic*: each link can be broken or weakened. The literature therefore talks about \u201csanctions **effectiveness**\u201d rather than \u201csanctions **cause** compliance.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2. Mechanisms that make sanctions work\n\n| Mechanism | How it operates | Key empirical support |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| **Financial isolation** | Cutting off access to the international banking system raises the cost of external financing and can freeze sovereign assets. | *Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009)* find that financial sanctions raise target borrowing costs by 1.5\u20133\u202fpercentage points on average, which is enough to force policy concessions in 30\u201340\u202f% of cases. |\n| **Trade disruption** | Export bans on critical inputs (e.g., high\u2011tech chips, oil) shrink a target\u2019s export revenues and raise production costs. | The 2014 EU\u2011US sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy sector reduced Russian oil exports by ~12\u202f% in the first two years, contributing to a 3\u202f% drop in GDP (World Bank, 2017). |\n| **Technology denial** | Blocking advanced equipment hampers military or nuclear programs that rely on foreign components. | Iran\u2019s \u201cdual\u2011use\u201d bans slowed its centrifuge enrichment speed by an estimated 30\u202f% (IAEA reports, 2015). |\n| **Signal & reputational cost** | Sanctions stigmatize a regime, making it harder to attract new partners and increasing diplomatic isolation. | After the 2022 sanctions on Russia, the number of new foreign\u2011direct investment projects fell by 45\u202f% (UNCTAD, 2023). |\n| **Domestic elite pressure** | Economic pain can incentivize powerful domestic groups (business oligarchs, military, technocrats) to push the leadership toward compromise. | In South Africa (1980s), sanctions\u2011induced capital flight contributed to elite negotiations that helped end apartheid (Sullivan, 2000). |\n| **Legal leverage** | Sanctions often come with the threat of secondary sanctions, which expand the cost to third\u2011party firms and increase compliance pressure. | US secondary\u2011sanctions on Iran\u2019s shipping sector forced many European ship owners to drop Iranian contracts, reducing Iranian oil shipments by ~40\u202f% in 2013 (EIA data). |\n\n*Take\u2011away*: The more a sanction attacks a **vital, hard\u2011to\u2011substitute** component of the target\u2019s economy, the higher its leverage.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

What sanctions are meant to do \u2013 the causal pathways\n\n| Pathway | How it is supposed to work | Key scholarly references |\n|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Economic pain \u2192 elite or public pressure** | Reducing a country\u2019s export earnings, foreign\u2011exchange, or access to finance raises the cost of the disputed policy for the ruling coalition and/or the population, creating internal pressure to change. | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f2007; Drezner\u202f2003 |\n| **Targeted\u2011elite incentives** | Freezing assets, travel bans, or secondary sanctions hit specific officials or firms, making the cost of staying in power higher than the benefit of the policy. | Peksen\u202f2015; Giumelli\u202f2022 |\n| **Signal & reputational cost** | Sanctions convey that the international community disapproves, which can make a regime fear diplomatic isolation or loss of future aid/investment. | Keohane & Nye\u202f1977; Baldwin\u202f1997 |\n| **Constraining capability** | Cutting off technology, dual\u2011use goods, or SWIFT banking limits a state\u2019s ability to pursue a programme (e.g., nuclear, missile). | Early\u202f1990s\u20112000s UN\u2011Security\u2011Council resolutions; Mueller\u202f2020 |\n| **Domestic political rally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag** (negative pathway) | External pressure can trigger nationalist mobilisation that solidifies the regime\u2019s resolve. | Gaddis\u202f2005; O\u2019Rourke\u202f2021 |\n| **Regime\u2011preserving \u201chard\u2011ball\u201d** | Sanctions may be used less as a coercive tool than as a punitive or symbolic gesture that signals resolve without expectation of change. | Mearsheimer\u202f2001; Pape\u202f1997 |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:**  Scholars agree that sanctions can operate through *both* \u201cpain\u201d and",

This meant they could no longer send or receive the standard, secure electronic messages that underpin most international payments.<br>* **Asset freezes** \u2013 Roughly **$4\u202fbillion** in Iranian sovereign assets (oil\u2011sale proceeds, central\u2011bank reserves) held in U.S. and EU banks were frozen.<br>* **Secondary\u2011sanctions threat** \u2013 U.S. law warned any non\u2011U.S. bank that continued to do \u201csignificant\u201d business with the blocked Iranian banks would lose its U.S. market access, effectively forcing global banks to comply. |\n| **Immediate economic impact** | * **Export\u2011revenue shock:** Iran\u2019s oil export earnings fell from **\u2248\u202f$78\u202fbillion (2005)** to **\u2248\u202f$31\u202fbillion (2012)**, a 60\u202f% decline, largely because oil\u2011sale proceeds could not be transferred abroad.<br>* **Currency depreciation:** The rial lost \u2248\u202f70\u202f% of its value against the dollar between 2011\u20112013, spiking inflation to >\u202f30\u202f% (World Bank, 2014).<br>* **Banking\u2011sector contraction:** Iranian banks saw a **\u2248\u202f40\u202f% drop** in correspondent\u2011bank relationships, limiting their ability to settle trade invoices and to service foreign\u2011currency debt. |\n| **Political pressure generated** | 1. **Fiscal strain:** The government\u2019s budget, heavily dependent on oil revenues, ran a **$30\u202fbillion deficit** in 2012\u201113, forcing cuts to subsidies and public\u2011sector wages.<br>2. **Elite discontent:** Powerful business families and technocratic officials (many of whom owned stakes in the sanctioned banks) lobbied the Supreme Leader and the President for a diplomatic solution, warning that continued isolation would cripple the private sector.<br>3. **Public unrest:** Inflation and shortages sparked street protests in Tehran and other major cities (e.g., the 2011 \u201cGreen Movement\u201d protests were partly fueled by economic grievances). |\n| **Outcome \u2013 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)** | * **Date:** 14\u202fJuly\u202f2015 (agreement signed in Vienna).<br>* **Key concessions by Iran:** Limit uranium enrichment to 3.67\u202f% (well below weapons\u2011grade), reduce its stockpile of low\u2011enriched uranium, and allow IAEA inspections.<br>* **Sanctions relief:** In return, the U.S., EU, and UN lifted the financial\u2011asset freezes, reinstated Iran\u2019s access to SWIFT, and allowed oil\u2011export revenues to be repatriated. |\n| **Why financial isolation mattered most** | 1. **Liquidity choke\u2011point:** Unlike trade bans (which Iran could partly evade by smuggling or barter), the loss of SWIFT and frozen assets meant Iran could not *pay* for the imports it still needed (machinery, food, medicines).

A series of UN Security\u2011Council resolutions (1737\u20111929) imposed *arms embargoes* and *targeted asset freezes* on individuals and entities.  Starting in 2006 the United States added *secondary sanctions* that threatened any non\u2011U.S. bank or company that dealt with Iran\u2019s energy sector.  In 2012 the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) placed the *Iranian Central Bank* and *Petro\u2011Iran* on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, effectively cutting Iran off from the SWIFT international payments system. |  |\n| **Financial\u2011isolation tools used** | 1. **Asset freezes** on Iran\u2011controlled entities in the U.S., EU, and other jurisdictions (\u2248\u202f$15\u201120\u202fbn frozen by 2015).<br>2. **SWIFT disconnection** (January\u202f2012) \u2013 Iranian banks could no longer send or receive standard international wire transfers.<br>3. **Secondary sanctions** on non\u2011U.S. banks that facilitated Iranian oil sales (e.g., *Bank of America* was warned in 2012; *Deutsche Bank* faced fines in 2015).<br>4. **Prohibition on U.S. dollar transactions** for Iranian oil & gas exports. |  |\n| **Observed economic impact** | \u2022 **Oil\u2011export revenue** fell from \u2248\u202f$70\u202fbn/yr (2005\u20112009) to \u2248\u202f$30\u202fbn/yr (2012\u20112014) \u2013 a 55\u202f% drop, largely because foreign banks refused to process payments.<br>\u2022 **Foreign\u2011exchange reserves** fell from >\u202f$150\u202fbn (2007) to <\u202f$70\u202fbn (2013).<br>\u2022 **Currency devaluation**: the rial lost >\u202f50\u202f% of its value against the dollar between 2011\u20112013, spiking inflation to >\u202f30\u202f% annually.<br>\u2022 **Banking sector contraction**: the Central Bank\u2019s liquidity fell by \u2248\u202f$30\u202fbn; Iranian banks were cut off from international clearing houses. |  |\n| **Negotiation outcome** | In July\u202f2015 Iran and the P5+1 (U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia, China) signed the JCPOA.  Iran agreed to: <br>\u2022 Reduce its enriched\u2011uranium stockpile from 10\u202f000\u202fkg to 300\u202fkg.<br>\u2022 Limit centrifuge numbers from ~\u202f19\u202f000 to 5\u202f060.<br>\u2022 Allow IAEA monitoring of declared sites.  In return, **UN, EU, and U.S. sanctions were lifted**, including reinstatement of SWIFT access and unfreezing of assets (\u2248\u202f$15\u202fbn). |  |\n| **Why scholars isolate \u201cfinancial isolation\u201d as the key factor** | 1. **Empirical timing** \u2013 The most rapid decline in oil revenue and reserve loss coincides with the *SWIFT shutdown* (Jan\u202f2012) and the *U.S. secondary\u2011sanctions threats* (mid\u20112012).

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1. What \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d are \u2013 a quick legal\u2011policy primer  \n\n| Term | Meaning | Who can impose them? | Typical legal basis |\n|------|---------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Primary sanctions** | Direct prohibitions that apply to *persons or entities* located in the sanction\u2011issuing jurisdiction (e.g., U.S. persons can\u2019t do business with Iran). | The sanctioning government (U.S., EU, UN). | National statutes (U.S. **International Emergency Economic Powers Act \u2013 IEEPA**, **Trading With the Enemy Act \u2013 TWEA**, EU **CFSP** regulations, UN **Chapter\u202fVII** resolutions). |\n| **Secondary sanctions** | *Extra\u2011jurisdictional* penalties aimed at **non\u2011resident, non\u2011U.S. (or non\u2011EU) persons** that voluntarily or knowingly provide \u201csignificant\u201d support to a primary\u2011sanctioned target. The penalty is usually the loss of *access* to the sanctioning country\u2019s market (e.g., U.S. financial system). | The same government that issued the primary sanctions, but they are \u201cextraterritorial\u201d in effect. | U.S. Executive Orders (e.g., **EO\u202f13382**, **EO\u202f13846**, **EO\u202f13871**, **EO\u202f14024**); EU \u201cblocking statutes\u201d that mirror U.S. secondary measures; UN resolutions that empower member states to impose secondary measures (less common). |\n| **Why they matter** | The global financial system is heavily U.S.- or EU\u2011centric. If a foreign bank or corporation is cut off from dollar\u2011cleared transactions, it loses a huge share of its business. The threat therefore compels third\u2011party actors to **self\u2011police** and stop dealing with the primary target, even though the third party is not itself under primary sanctions. | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n\n### How the threat is turned into a concrete enforcement action  \n\n1. **Designation** \u2013 The Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) (U.S.) or the EU\u2019s \u201cSanctions Committee\u201d publishes a list of *secondary\u2011sanctions violators* (e.g., \u201cEntity List\u201d in the U.S., \u201cEU Consolidated List\u201d). The listing cites the activity (e.g., \u201cproviding Iran\u2011related petrochemical services\u201d).  \n\n2. **Penalty** \u2013 Once listed, the designated party is **blocked**: all its assets under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with it. In practice, the designation also triggers **de\u2011risking** by non\u2011U.S. banks because they fear secondary penalties from the U.S. (loss of correspondent\u2011bank relationships, fines, loss of access to the U.S. clearing system).  \n\n3. **Compliance monitoring** \u2013 OFAC publishes **General Licenses** that allow limited activities (e.g., humanitarian aid) and issues **FAQs** that explain what constitutes \u201csignificant\u201d support. Banks run automated screening against these lists and must certify to regulators that they have no prohibited ties.  \n\n4. **Enforcement** \u2013 Violations can result in civil penalties of **up to $1\u202fmillion per violation** (U.S.) or **criminal penalties** of up to **$10\u202fmillion** and **20\u202fyears imprisonment** for individuals. The EU can impose **fines of up to \u20ac10\u202fmillion** or 10\u202f% of worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.  \n\n5. **Iterative pressure** \u2013 If a foreign entity continues to transact with the target, the sanctioning government can expand the list, add new sectors, or impose **sector\u2011wide secondary sanctions** (e.g., \u201cany foreign bank that facilitates more than $50\u202fmillion of Russian oil revenue per year will be sanctioned\u201d).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. The secondary\u2011sanctions threat in the **Iran** case (how it operated on the ground)\n\n| Step | Practical effect on a non\u2011U.S. bank or firm |\n|------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **a. Threat signal** | In 2012, OFAC issued **General License\u202fD** (later revoked) that allowed limited \u201chumanitarian\u201d transactions with Iran but warned that any *significant* trade in oil, petrochemicals, or dual\u2011use goods would trigger secondary sanctions. |\n| **b. Screening** | Major global banks (HSBC, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank, etc.) upgraded their compliance software to flag any correspondent\u2011bank relationship with **Bank\u202fMelli\u202fIran** or **Bank\u202fSaderat**. |\n| **c. \u201cDe\u2011risk",
