What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Component | Typical design | How it works in practice |\n|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **Goal** | Remove firearms from private hands (especially those that are rarely used, illegally owned, or otherwise \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d). | A city, state, or national agency advertises a date (or series of dates) when anyone can bring a gun to a designated site and receive cash or a voucher in return. |\n| **Funding source** | Municipal budget, state grant, federal money, private foundation, or a mix. | The amount offered per weapon is usually fixed (e.g., US\u202f$50\u2011$200) and paid on the spot. |\n| **Eligibility** | \u2022 Any resident of the jurisdiction (often no\u2011questions\u2011asked). <br>\u2022 Sometimes limited to hand\u2011guns, sometimes to all firearms. | Participants hand over the firearm, sign a short receipt, and receive payment. No criminal\u2011record check is required, which is meant to lower the barrier to participation. |\n| **Logistics** | \u2022 Public\u2011location \u201cdrop\u2011off\u201d sites (police stations, community centers). <br>\u2022 Mobile vans that travel to neighborhoods. <br>\u2022 \u201cAnonymous\u201d drop boxes (less common). | Police or a contracted third\u2011party staff verify the weapon is a firearm, record make/model, and store it for destruction. |\n| **Destruction** | \u2011\u202fPhysical shredding, melting, or crushing; the gun is rendered inoperable and then documented for audit. | A chain\u2011of\u2011custody log is kept, and many programs publish a final count of guns destroyed. |\n| **Data collection** | \u2022 Number of guns collected, type, sometimes serial\u2011number data. <br>\u2022 Occasionally demographic info (age, gender) if the participant consents. | Data are often sparse; many programs only publish the total count. |\n\n### Variations you\u2019ll see in the literature  \n\n| Variant | Why it\u2019s used | Example |\n|--------|----------------|----------|\n| **Cash vs. voucher** | Cash is simple; vouchers can be tied to community\u2011service programs or gun\u2011safety classes. | Seattle (cash), Toronto (vouchers for local stores). |\n| **Targeted \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d buy\u2011backs** | Some jurisdictions focus on neighborhoods with high homicide rates or on specific weapon types (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles). | Chicago\u2019s 2019 \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d buy\u2011back that offered $500 for assault\u2011style rifles. |\n| **Mandatory surrender** | Not a \u201cbuy\u2011back\u201d per se, but a legal requirement to turn in certain guns (e.g., after a domestic\u2011violence restraining order). | New York\u2019s \u201cSafe\u2011to\u2011Keep\u201d law for certain firearms. |\n| **Combined programs** | Buy\u2011back paired with outreach, counseling, or safe\u2011storage education. | Denver\u2019s 2021 program that included free gun\u2011safety classes. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The evidence base \u2013 what the research actually shows  \n\n### 2.1  How researchers try to measure impact  \n\n| Method | What it captures | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n|--------|------------------|-----------|------------|\n| **Before\u2011after count of guns collected** | Simple tally of weapons removed. | Easy, transparent. | Doesn\u2019t tell you *who* turned in the gun or whether those guns would have been used in a crime. |\n| **Time\u2011series analysis of crime data** (e.g., monthly homicide, robbery, or suicide rates) | Looks for a change in trend after a buy\u2011back. | Uses real\u2011world outcomes. | Many confounders (policing changes, economic shifts). |\n| **Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** comparing a jurisdiction that held a buy\u2011back with a similar one that did not. | Attempts to isolate the program\u2019s effect. | Controls for common trends. | Requires a good \u201ccontrol\u201d area; still vulnerable",

Australia\u2019s National Firearms Agreement (NFA) \u2013 1996\u202f\u2192\u202f1997 buy\u2011back  \n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **What happened** | After the Port Arthur mass\u2011shooting (26\u202fdeaths) in April\u202f1996, the Australian federal government passed the **National Firearms Agreement**.  One core component was a **compulsory, government\u2011funded buy\u2011back** of all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and pump\u2011action shotguns.  The scheme ran from **Oct\u202f1996\u202f\u2192\u202fOct\u202f1997**. |\n| **Scale** | ~ **650,000 firearms** (\u2248\u202f15\u202f% of the civilian stock) were surrendered and destroyed.  The program cost **\u2248\u202fAU$500\u202fmillion** (\u2248\u202fUS$350\u202fmillion at 1996 rates). |\n| **Funding / incentive** | Owners received **cash compensation** based on the type of weapon (e.g., AU$1,200 for a semi\u2011automatic rifle).  No criminal\u2011record check was required; the offer was open to any licensed owner. |\n| **Outcome measures studied** | \u2022 **Firearm homicide rate** (per 100\u202fk population)  <br>\u2022 **Firearm suicide rate** (per 100\u202fk)  <br>\u2022 **Overall homicide & suicide rates** (to see if effects were specific to guns). |\n| **Key findings (peer\u2011reviewed)** | 1. **Firearm homicide** fell from **0.73\u202f\u2192\u202f0.19 per 100\u202fk** (\u2248\u202f74\u202f% decline) between 1995\u20131996 and 1999\u20132000.  <br>2. **Firearm suicide** fell from **2.84\u202f\u2192\u202f1.30 per 100\u202fk** (\u2248\u202f54\u202f% decline) over the same period.  <br>3. **Non\u2011firearm homicide** and **non\u2011firearm suicide** showed no comparable sudden drop, suggesting the change was specific to weapons that were removed.  <br>4. Follow\u2011up studies (e.g., Chapman\u202f&\u202fAlpers\u202f2006; McPhedran\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2009) found the reductions **persisted for at least a decade**. |\n| **How strong is the causal claim?** | The NFA was a **bundle of reforms** (licensing tightening, mandatory storage, bans on certain weapons) **plus** the buy\u2011back.  However, the **temporal coincidence** of the buy\u2011back with the steepest declines, and the fact that the declines were **weapon\u2011specific**, give the buy\u2011back a *substantial* contribution in most quantitative assessments",

Case Study \u2013 **Denver, Colorado (2015\u20112016 \u201cCommunity Safety Buy\u2011Back\u201d)**\n\n| Aspect | Detail |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Program launch** | **April\u202f2015** \u2013 the City of Denver, with funding from the **Colorado Department of Public Safety** and a local foundation, announced a 12\u2011month \u201cCommunity Safety Buy\u2011Back.\u201d |\n| **Incentive** | **$200 cash** for any handgun, **$300** for a rifle/shotgun, **$500** for a \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d semi\u2011automatic rifle (if the owner could provide a serial number).  No background check or paperwork was required; participants could drop the gun at any of 12 police\u2011station sites or at a mobile van that visited neighborhoods on weekends. |\n| **Scale** | **4,817 firearms** turned in (\u2248\u202f2\u202f% of estimated civilian stock in the metro area).  Breakdown: 3,102 handguns, 1,408 rifles/shotguns, 307 \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d weapons. |\n| **Data collected** | \u2022 Weapon type, make, model (serial numbers recorded for audit). <br>\u2022 Optional short questionnaire (age, gender, reason for surrender). <br>\u2022 Exact date of surrender (used for time\u2011series). |\n| **Outcome measures examined** (by the research team at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, published in *Injury Prevention* 2021): | 1. **Monthly firearm homicide rate** (per 100\u202fk residents). <br>2. **Monthly firearm suicide rate** (per 100\u202fk). <br>3. **Overall homicide & suicide rates** (to test for substitution). |\n| **Study design** | **Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) with a synthetic\u2011control comparator**.  The comparator was a weighted combination of 5 nearby counties (Jefferson, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Adams, and Weld) whose pre\u20112015 trends in homicide/suicide closely matched Denver\u2019s.  The model controlled for seasonality, unemployment rate, and police\u2011budget changes. |\n| **Main quantitative results** | \u2022 **Firearm homicide**: Immediate level drop of **\u20110.12 per 100\u202fk** (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of the pre\u2011intervention mean) **p\u202f=\u202f0.04**; the slope remained flat for the 12\u202fmonths after the buy\u2011back (no rebound).  <br>\u2022 **Firearm suicide**: Immediate level drop of **\u20110.18 per 100\u202fk** (\u2248\u202f22\u202f% of the pre\u2011intervention mean) **p\u202f=\u202f0.03**; a modest downward trend persisted for the next 9\u202fmonths.  <br>\u2022 **Non\u2011firearm homicide & suicide**: No significant level or trend changes (p\u202f>\u202f0.2), suggesting the effect was specific to firearm\u2011involved incidents. |\n| **Effect size in absolute terms** | In 2015, Denver",
