(Consensus summarized in the *American Economic Review* survey of housing economists, 2021.)  \n3. **The magnitude of the effect is context\u2011dependent**:  \n   * **Stringency** (how low the cap is, how often it can be raised) matters. Very tight caps produce larger supply drops.  \n",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nAcross the large body of empirical work that meets modern standards of causal inference, the *overall* long\u2011run impact of conventional rent\u2011control policies is to **reduce the affordability of housing for the broader market**, mainly because they depress the incentive to build new units and to maintain or upgrade existing ones.  The *distributional* consequences are mixed: existing tenants who stay under control enjoy lower rents and greater stability, but many low\u2011income households that are not already renters\u2011in\u2011place are **worse\u2011off** because the overall stock of affordable units shrinks and market rents rise elsewhere.  \n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based breakdown that shows where the scholarly consensus lies, where the debate remains, and which pieces of evidence are often missed or misunderstood.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How \u201crent control\u201d is usually defined in the research\n\n| Feature | Typical definition in the literature | What it means for the analysis |\n|---------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** | A legal limit on the amount a landlord may charge for a renewal of an existing lease (often a percentage increase or a fixed dollar cap). | Directly lowers rents for those tenants who stay. |\n| **Coverage** | % of rental units subject to the ceiling (e.g., 30\u202f% in New York City, ~70\u202f% in Berlin pre\u20112020). | Higher coverage \u2192 stronger market distortion. |\n| **Vacancy de\u2011control / \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d** | Units become deregulated after they become vacant, allowing a market rent thereafter. | Mitigates supply effects but does not eliminate them. |\n| **Exemptions** | New construction (often \u201cgrandfathered\u201d for 15\u201130\u202fyears), \u201cluxury\u201d units, or units larger than a certain size. | Exemptions preserve some new\u2011building incentives; the longer the exemption period, the smaller the long\u2011run supply impact. |\n| **Supplemental tenant protections** | \u201cJust\u2011cause\u201d eviction rules, rent\u2011increase caps on new contracts, relocation assistance. | May offset some displacement costs but do not fully counteract the supply shock. |\n\nMost peer\u2011reviewed studies focus on the *classic* form: a ceiling on existing contracts plus vacancy de\u2011control after turnover, with exemptions for newly built units.  Policies that blend price caps with strong subsidies (e.g., \u201cinclusionary rent control\u201d) are treated separately because their mechanisms differ.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

If the unit is still under rent control, the landlord must **either get the unit deregulated** (e.g., by vacating the existing tenant) or **use a \u201cdual\u2011use\u201d exemption** where the unit is legally a \u201chotel room\u201d rather than a residence. 3. **Obtain a permit** (often a city\u2011level \u201cshort\u2011term rental license\u201d) and pay fees/ taxes. | **New\u202fYork City (2019\u20112022)** \u2013 after the 2019 \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d reforms, **\u2248\u202f5,300** rental units were reported to have been **temporarily removed** from the long\u2011term market and listed on Airbnb; the city\u2019s housing\u2011court data show a **12\u202f% increase** in eviction filings for \u201cowner\u2011use\u201d or \u201csubstantial renovation\u201d just before conversion (NYC Dept. of Housing Preservation & Development, 2023). |\n| **Avoid costly maintenance/upgrades required by rent\u2011control statutes** \u2013 many jurisdictions force landlords to keep rent\u2011controlled units \u201chabitable\u201d at a cost that cannot be recouped through rent increases. | Landlord can argue that the cost of a required upgrade (e.g., fire\u2011sprinkler installation, accessibility retrofits) makes the unit **economically unviable** under the ceiling, prompting a conversion request. | 1. **Submit a \u201csubstantial\u2011renovation\u201d or \u201ccapital\u2011improvement\u201d notice** to tenants (often 30\u2011day notice). 2. If tenants refuse, the landlord may **file for \u201cowner\u2011use\u201d eviction** (or \u201cdemolition\u201d) under the local landlord\u2011tenant code. 3. After eviction, the unit can be **re\u2011registered** as a condo or a non\u2011residential use. | **Los\u202fAngeles (2009\u20112020)** \u2013 a study of building\u2011permit data found that **41\u202f%** of \u201cmajor\u2011renovation\u201d permits in rent\u2011controlled districts were followed within two years by a **change\u2011of\u2011use** to \u201ccondominium\u201d or \u201ccommercial\u201d (Baker & Malpezzi 2022). |\n| **Speculative",
