      "unknown_model_response": "### 1.  Why major nuclear accidents are extremely rare  \n\n| Reason | What it means for nuclear plants | How it contrasts with coal\u2011related health impacts |\n|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Physics of the fuel** | A nuclear reactor contains **kilograms** of fissile material that is **engineered to stay sub\u2011critical** unless a very specific sequence of failures occurs. The chain reaction is self\u2011regulating: if temperature or pressure rises, the reaction automatically slows (negative temperature/void coefficients). | Coal combustion is a **continuous, uncontrolled chemical reaction**. As long as fuel is burned, pollutants are emitted; there is no intrinsic \u201cshut\u2011off\u201d mechanism. |\n| **Multiple, independent safety barriers** | Modern reactors have **\u201cdefence\u2011in\u2011depth\u201d**: (1) fuel cladding, (2) pressure\u2011tube or reactor\u2011vessel containment, (3) secondary containment buildings, (4) emergency core\u2011cooling systems, (5) passive safety features that work without power or operator action. Failure of *all* barriers is required for a large release. | Coal plants have far fewer hard barriers. The main health burden comes from the **continuous release of pollutants** that disperse into the atmosphere; a single malfunction (e.g., a scrubber failure) instantly raises emissions. |\n| **Regulatory environment & licensing** | Nuclear licences are granted only after **probabilistic safety assessments (PSA)** that estimate the probability of core\u2011damage or large release (usually <10\u207b\u2076\u202fper reactor\u2011year). After construction, plants are subject to **continuous inspections, mandatory safety upgrades, and periodic stress\u2011tests** (e.g., post\u2011Fukushima \u201cstress\u2011test\u201d regime in Europe). | Coal plants are regulated mainly for **emission limits** (SO\u2082, NO\u2093, PM). Inspections focus on compliance with those limits, not on preventing catastrophic failure. The health impact is already \u201cbuilt\u2011in\u201d to the emissions profile. |\n| **Operator training & safety culture** | The nuclear industry has a **highly formalized safety culture**: crew qualifications, simulator training, mandatory drills, a \u201cno\u2011blame\u201d reporting system for near\u2011misses, and international peer\u2011review (e.g., IAEA OSART missions). | Coal\u2011mine and plant operations also have safety programs, but the **industry-wide safety culture is more heterogeneous**; fatal accidents in mines (collapses, rock\u2011bursts) still occur with a frequency of a few per\u202f10\u2076\u202fworker\u2011hours. |\n| **Economic incentives** | A **large accident would wipe out the entire business** and trigger massive liability, so owners invest heavily in redundancy and in meeting the most stringent design codes (e.g., ASME, IEC). | Coal plants have a **lower upfront capital cost**; the marginal cost of a shutdown due to a safety incident is relatively small compared with the long\u2011term health costs that are externalised to society. |\n| **Historical record** | Since the start of commercial nuclear power (\u2248\u202f1950), the world has seen **only three accidents that released significant radiation** (Three Mile Island \u2013 1979, Chernobyl \u2013 1986, Fukushima \u2013 2011). Of those, only Chernobyl produced a large, immediate death toll; the others caused no direct fatalities.  The **frequency** is roughly **1 serious accident per 10\u2075\u201310\u2076 reactor\u2011years**. | Coal\u2011related premature deaths are **continuous**: WHO estimates ~\u202f0.5\u202fmillion deaths per year worldwide from ambient PM\u2082.\u2085 generated by coal combustion. These deaths accrue **every year** and are not tied to a single event. |\n| **Statistical nature of the risk** | Nuclear risk is dominated by **low\u2011probability, high\u2011consequence** events. Because the probability is so small, the *expected* number of deaths per unit of electricity stays low (\u2248\u202f0.04\u20130.07\u202fdeaths/TWh). | Coal risk is **high\u2011probability, low\u2011consequence per unit time** (air\u2011pollution exposure). The cumulative effect is much larger, giving ~\u202f20\u2013",
