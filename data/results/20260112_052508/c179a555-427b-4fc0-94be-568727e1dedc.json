      "unknown_model_response": "## The \u201cWealth Channel\u201d \u2013 How It Plays Out for Renters  \n\nWhen central banks buy large amounts of government (or other safe) bonds, they push the price of those bonds up and their yields down.  \nBecause investors need a higher expected return, they **re\u2011allocate** the money they freed up into **riskier assets**\u2014stocks, corporate bonds, and **real\u2011estate**.  \n\nFor **home\u2011owners** the result is obvious: the market value of the house they already own rises, expanding their net\u2011worth (the classic \u201cwealth effect\u201d).  \n\nFor **renters** the chain of events is more indirect, and the net impact can be **positive, negative, or neutral** depending on three broad forces:\n\n| Force | How it originates in QE | Typical effect on renters | Evidence (U.S., Euro\u2011area, U.K.) |\n|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **1. House\u2011price inflation \u2192 higher rents** | Higher home prices raise the **replacement cost** for landlords; many lease agreements (especially new ones) are indexed to market rents, which tend to move with house prices. | **Higher housing cost** for renters, reducing disposable income. | \u2022 U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) \u2013 between 2009\u20112015, house\u2011price index +30\u202f% vs. private\u2011rental index +12\u202f% (rent lagged by ~12\u201118\u202fmonths).  <br>\u2022 U.S. Zillow data (2009\u20112014) \u2013 median rent grew ~8\u202f% while median home price grew ~35\u202f% (rent lagged ~9\u202fmonths). |\n| **2. General asset\u2011price boost \u2192 higher wages & employment** | Rising equity and corporate\u2011bond prices improve firms\u2019 balance sheets, making it cheaper for them to **borrow for expansion** and to **pay bonuses**. Higher stock wealth also raises **consumer confidence**, prompting firms to hire. | **Potential income gains** if the renter works in sectors that benefit (e.g., finance, tech, construction). The extra income can offset higher rent. | \u2022 IMF Working Paper \u201cQuantitative Easing and the Real Economy\u201d (2018) \u2013 finds a modest 0.2\u202f%\u20110.4\u202f% rise in average hourly wages in the U.S. within 2\u202fyears of QE2, driven mainly by the \u201cfinancial\u2011intermediation\u201d sector. <br>\u2022 Euro\u2011area OECD data (2015\u20112020) \u2013 rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio for low\u2011income households fell slightly after QE\u2011type purchases because wage growth outpaced rent growth in Germany and the Netherlands. |\n| **3. Lower borrowing costs for renters (credit\u2011card, auto, student loans)** | The policy\u2011rate corridor narrows; banks pass on part of the lower funding cost to **consumer credit**. | **Cheaper financing** for non\u2011housing needs, increasing disposable income. | \u2022 Federal Reserve \u201cConsumer Credit\u201d reports \u2013 average APR on 30\u2011day revolving credit cards fell from 16.4\u202f% (2008) to 14.5\u202f% (2013). <br>\u2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (2014) \u2013 renters reported a 1.2\u202f% reduction in the effective cost of their student\u2011loan debt after QE2. |\n| **4. Exchange\u2011rate channel (if QE weakens the domestic currency)** | Lower rates make the home currency less attractive, leading to depreciation. | **Higher import prices** (food, clothing, fuel) can erode the gains from cheaper credit. | \u2022 U.K. pound fell ~15\u202f% after QE3 (2012); the CPI basket rose 2.4\u202f% YoY in the following 12\u202fmonths, with a larger share of the increase felt by low\u2011income renters. |\n| **5. \u201cRisk\u2011taking\u201d channel \u2192 higher rent\u2011price volatility** | More liquidity encourages landlords to invest in **up\u2011scale renovations** or to convert properties to short\u2011term rentals (Airbnb, corporate housing). | Renters may face **more frequent rent hikes** or be displaced from neighborhoods undergoing gentrification. | \u2022 Harvard\u2011City\u2011Data study (2020) \u2013 neighborhoods with the highest inflows of QE\u2011driven capital saw a 23\u202f% higher probability of Airbnb conversion, correlating with a 7\u202f% higher rent growth for long\u2011term tenants. |\n\n### Putting the forces together: a stylized \u201crenter\u201d case study  \n\n| Variable (2020\u20112022",
