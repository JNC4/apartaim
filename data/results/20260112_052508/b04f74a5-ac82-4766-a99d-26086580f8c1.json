      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** \u2013 the large\u2011scale purchase of government bonds (and sometimes other securities) by a central bank \u2013 is a monetary\u2011policy tool that works through several transmission channels.  \nThe way those channels interact with the balance sheets of households, firms and investors determines the *distributional* outcomes of QE. Below is a synthesis of the most widely cited mechanisms, the empirical evidence that supports them, and the points on which economists still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels of QE  \n\n| Channel | What the central bank does | How it affects the economy | Typical \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d |\n|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Central bank buys long\u2011dated government bonds \u2192 pushes up their price, lowers yields. | Investors shift out of the now\u2011cheaper bonds into riskier assets (corporate bonds, equities, real\u2011estate, high\u2011yield debt). | **Winners:** holders of equities, corporate bonds, REITs, high\u2011net\u2011worth households that own these assets. **Losers:** investors who rely on safe\u2011asset yields (e.g., retirees with large cash or Treasury holdings). |\n| **Interest\u2011rate channel** | By lowering long\u2011term yields, QE reduces the cost of borrowing for mortgages, corporate loans, and sovereign debt. | Lower borrowing costs stimulate consumption (especially housing) and corporate investment; also reduce debt\u2011service burdens. | **Winners:** borrowers (mortgage\u2011owners, firms needing credit). **Losers:** savers whose bank deposits earn lower interest; pension funds that must meet return targets with lower yields. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Large asset purchases raise domestic asset prices, attracting foreign capital, which can *appreciate* the currency; alternatively, the lower yields can *depreciate* the currency if capital flows out. | A weaker currency boosts export competitiveness but raises import prices. | **Winners:** export\u2011oriented firms, domestic producers that face less foreign competition. **Losers:** import\u2011dependent households and firms (e.g., retailers, airlines). |\n| **Expectations / inflation channel** | QE signals that the central bank is committed to keeping policy accommodative, raising expectations of future inflation. | Higher expected inflation can raise nominal wages and reduce real debt burdens; it also influences wage\u2011price negotiations. | **Winners:** borrowers with fixed\u2011rate debt. **Losers:** those on fixed incomes (pensioners, low\u2011wage workers) if wages do not keep pace. |\n| **Credit\u2011supply channel** | By buying private\u2011sector securities (e.g., corporate bonds, asset\u2011backed securities) the central bank directly expands the pool of high\u2011quality collateral, encouraging banks to lend. | Improves credit availability, especially for riskier borrowers. | **Winners:** firms that were credit\u2011constrained, small\u2011 and medium\u2011size enterprises (SMEs). **Losers:** sectors that do not benefit from easier credit (e.g., utilities with already low\u2011cost financing). |\n\n*The relative strength of each channel varies across episodes (U.S. QE1\u20113, Euro\u2011area PEPP, Bank of Japan\u2019s \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing\u201d, etc.).*\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Asset purchases** | The Fed (or another central bank) buys large amounts of long\u2011dated Treasury and agency securities. | The price of those securities rises, their yields (interest rates) fall. The 10\u2011yr Treasury yield is a benchmark for many other rates. | Banks fund their lending by borrowing (deposits, wholesale funding, etc.). When the *benchmark* rate drops, the *cost* of that funding falls. |\n| **2. Yield curve compression** | By pushing down long\u2011term yields, QE narrows the spread between short\u2011 and long\u2011term rates. | The \u201crisk\u2011free\u201d rate that underlies almost every other interest\u2011rate contract (mortgages, corporate bonds, CDs, savings accounts) is lower. | Banks can lend at lower rates but still need to keep a spread (profit margin). To preserve that spread, they often **reduce the rate they pay on deposits**. |\n| **3. Competition for safe assets** | QE creates a \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d effect: investors sell the now\u2011cheap safe bonds and look for a bit more yield elsewhere (e.g., corporate bonds, equities). | Demand for *riskier* assets rises, but demand for the safest\u2011return assets (like a plain\u2011vanilla savings account) falls. | With fewer savers competing for the same pool of safe, short\u2011term funding, banks have less pressure to offer higher rates. |\n\n**Result:** The nominal interest rate on a regular (interest\u2011bearing) checking or savings account typically tracks the *short\u2011term* policy rate plus a small \u201cbank\u2011margin\u201d. When QE drives that policy rate toward zero, the margin shrinks, and the advertised APY (annual percentage yield) can fall to **near\u2011zero**.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

The gap between the Fed Funds rate and the deposit APY is called the **\u201cdeposit spread.\u201d** During the QE years the spread widened dramatically because the policy rate hit the zero lower bound while banks kept a modest net interest margin.\n\n**Takeaway:**  \n- **Nominally** your money earned *less* because the headline rate fell.  \n- **Real\u2011interest\u2011rate** (nominal rate minus inflation) often turned **negative**.

      "truthbot_response": "## Quick answer  \n**Yes \u2013 quantitative easing (QE) usually pushes the interest you earn on a regular bank\u2011deposit account down.**  \nThe chain of events looks like this:\n\n1. **The Fed buys large amounts of long\u2011dated Treasury bonds and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS).**  \n2. Their prices rise, their yields fall \u2192 **long\u2011term market interest rates drop.**  \n3. The **policy short\u2011term rate** is already near zero, so the whole yield curve is compressed.  \n4. Banks\u2019 **cost of funding** (what they must pay to obtain money) falls, but **the return they can earn on safe assets** (Treasuries, agency MBS, high\u2011quality corporate bonds) also falls.  \n5. Because a \u201cregular\u201d savings account is essentially a **low\u2011risk, short\u2011term loan to the bank**, the bank can\u2019t earn a higher spread on those funds, so it **reduces the deposit\u2011interest rate** it offers to keep its net\u2011interest margin (NIM) reasonable.  \n\nThe net effect: **your nominal savings\u2011account rate tends to be lower during QE periods**.  \nBelow is a more detailed walk\u2011through, evidence from the United States (the best\u2011documented case), and a short \u201chow\u2011to\u2011check your own situation\u201d guide.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Central\u2011bank balance\u2011sheet expansion** | The Fed creates reserves and uses them to buy Treasuries/MBS. | Purchases push up bond prices \u2192 **yields (interest rates) fall** on those securities. |\n| **B. Yield\u2011curve compression** | Treasury yields at the 10\u2011yr and 30\u2011yr points fall by 100\u2011200\u202fbps during a QE round (e.g., 10\u2011yr Treasury fell from ~4\u202f% in early 2008 to ~2\u202f% in 2012). | Most bank\u2011deposit rates are loosely tied to the level of long\u2011term yields (through the \u201cinterest\u2011rate transmission\u201d channel). |\n| **C. Lower short\u2011term policy rate** | The Fed\u2019s target federal\u2011funds rate is already at the zero lower bound (\u2248\u202f0\u20110.25\u202f%). | Banks cannot lower their policy\u2011rate cost much further, so they look to **reduce the spread they pay on deposits**. |\n| **D. Reduced \u201crisk\u2011free\u201d return on banks\u2019 asset side** | Banks hold a lot of the same Treasuries/MBS they buy from the Fed (or they can borrow them cheap in the repo market). The **interest they earn on these assets falls**. | If a bank\u2019s asset yields drop by, say, 150\u202fbps, it must **shrink its net\u2011interest margin (NIM)** unless it raises loan rates (which would be counter\u2011productive to the QE goal). |\n| **E. Deposit\u2011rate adjustment** | To keep NIM roughly stable, banks **lower the rates they pay on checking, savings, and money\u2011market accounts**. | That is the number you see on your bank statement. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** QE depresses the \u201crisk\u2011free\u201d rate (Treasury yields). Because a regular deposit is a low\u2011risk, short\u2011term loan, the bank\u2019s willingness to pay for that loan falls in step with the overall market.\n\n### 1.1. The \u201csearch\u2011for\u2011yield\u201d side\u2011effect (optional)\n\nWhen safe yields are very low, some banks **increase fees or push higher\u2011yield, higher\u2011risk products** (e.g., CDs with longer maturities, brokerage accounts, or \u201chigh\u2011interest savings\u201d linked to market\u2011linked funds). That does **not** raise the nominal rate on a standard",
