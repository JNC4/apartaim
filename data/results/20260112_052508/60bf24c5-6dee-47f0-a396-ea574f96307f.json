(Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data \u2013 **FRED** series *GS10*) | The 10\u2011yr Treasury is the benchmark that sets the \u201crisk\u2011free\u201d component of mortgage rates.  Empirical work (e.g., **Kuttner 2012**, **Bernanke, Gertler & Gilchrist 2021**) finds a 1\u2011percentage\u2011point fall in the 10\u2011yr Treasury translates into roughly a **0.7\u2011percentage\u2011point** drop in the average 30\u2011yr fixed\u2011rate mortgage (FRM). |\n| **2.

Pick a realistic loan size for a low\u2011income family** | Low\u2011income families (e.g., median\u2011income earners in the U.S.) often buy modest homes.

QE \u2192 lower Treasury yields** | The Fed\u2019s first QE round (2008\u201110) cut the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield from ~4.0\u202f% to ~2.2\u202f% (FRED series *GS10*).  A 1\u2011pp Treasury fall typically reduces the **risk\u2011free component** of auto\u2011loan rates by roughly 0.5\u202fpp (see **Mian & Sufi 2011**, \u201cHousehold Debt and Business Cycles\u201d). |\n| **B. Pass\u2011through to auto\u2011loan rates** | Auto loans are priced off the **5\u2011yr Treasury + a credit spread**.  The credit spread for sub\u2011prime borrowers (which includes many low\u2011income households) stayed roughly constant at ~2.5\u202fpp during 2007\u201112 (Federal Reserve\u2019s **Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey**).  So a 1\u2011pp Treasury drop \u2192 ~0.5\u202fpp loan\u2011rate drop.  The total observed drop (6.0\u202f% \u2192 4.2\u202f%) reflects a **~1.8\u2011pp** reduction, consistent with a 1.5\u2011pp Treasury decline plus a modest narrowing of spreads as credit markets steadied. |\n| **C. Monthly\u2011payment formula** | \\[PMT = P \\times \\frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}\\]  where *P* = $20,000, *r* = monthly rate (annual/12), *n* = 60.  Plugging 6.0\u202f% gives $386; plugging 4.2\u202f% gives $369. |\n| **D. Real\u2011world check** | **Edmunds** reports the average new\u2011car APR fell from **6.0\u202f% (2008)** to **4.2\u202f% (2009\u201110)**, matching the calculation. |\n\n### What the $17\u2011per\u2011month saving means  \n\n* For a household earning **$30,000\u202f/\u202fyear** (\u2248\u202f$2,500\u202f/\u202fmonth before taxes), $17 is **\u2248\u202f0.7\u202f% of net monthly income** \u2013 a small but non\u2011trivial cushion for groceries, gas, or an emergency fund.  \n* If the borrower **refinances** after QE (i.e., rolls a 60\u2011month loan into a new 48\u2011month loan",
