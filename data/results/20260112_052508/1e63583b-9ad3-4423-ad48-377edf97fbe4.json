Theoretical pathways \u2013 why sanctions should (or should not) change behavior  \n\n| Mechanism | Description | Evidence of effectiveness | Main criticisms / limits |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Economic coercion** \u2013 *material cost* | Sanctions raise the price of imports, cut export revenues, freeze assets, restrict financing, or block technology. The target must choose between enduring the cost or complying. | \u2022 Studies of **UN arms embargoes** (e.g., on South Africa, Liberia) show a measurable decline in military spending after 2\u20114\u202fyears (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal., 2007).  <br>\u2022 **Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions** on elites (asset freezes, travel bans) have produced policy concessions in cases like **South Africa\u2019s apartheid dismantling** (Mack\u202fet\u202fal., 1998). | \u2022 **Economic resilience**: Countries can substitute trade partners, tap sovereign wealth funds, or increase domestic production.  <br>\u2022 **Regime insulation**: Autocratic elites often shield themselves from the pain, passing it to the populace. |\n| **Political signaling / reputational cost** | Sanctions convey that the international community disapproves, potentially reducing the target\u2019s diplomatic leverage or access to multilateral institutions. | \u2022 **EU\u2011Russia sanctions (2014)** reduced Russia\u2019s ability to secure loans from European banks (World Bank, 2016).  <br>\u2022 **Sanctions on Myanmar (2021)** prompted a modest opening of diplomatic channels with ASEAN. | \u2022 **Counter\u2011signaling**: Targets may double\u2011down on defiant rhetoric, using sanctions as a \u201cbadge of resistance.\u201d  <br>\u2022 **Limited leverage** when the target already has strong alternative alliances (e.g., China, Iran). |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | Economic pain may provoke protests, elite defections, or intra\u2011elite competition, forcing leaders to change policy to preserve power. | \u2022 **Iraq (1990\u20112003)**: UN sanctions contributed to weakening Saddam Hussein\u2019s patron\u2011client networks, making the 2003 invasion easier (Kaufmann, 2004).  <br>\u2022 **South Africa (1990s)**: Sanctions helped galvanize internal opposition and delegitimize apartheid. | \u2022 **Repression intensifies**: Leaders may crack down harder, blaming external enemies, as seen in **Zimbabwe (2000s)** and **Belarus (2020\u20112022)**. |\n| **Deterrence / future\u2011behavior shaping** | The threat of sanctions may deter future undesirable actions, even if the current round is not fully successful. | \u2022 **North Korea**: Repeated sanctions have not stopped nuclear tests, but they have limited the regime\u2019s ability to develop certain dual\u2011use technologies (UN Panel",
