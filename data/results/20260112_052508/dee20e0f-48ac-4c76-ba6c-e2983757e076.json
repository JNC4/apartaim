      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe scientific literature to date does not provide convincing evidence that 5\u2011G cellular\u2011network base stations (the \u201ctowers\u201d most people see on rooftops or poles) cause adverse health effects at the exposure levels that are permitted by national and international safety standards.  Most health\u2011concern claims focus on the possibility of non\u2011thermal biological effects of radio\u2011frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) \u2013 especially cancer, reproductive problems, and neurological symptoms \u2013 but the bulk of high\u2011quality epidemiological and experimental data, as well as the assessments of major health agencies, conclude that the risk is\u202f*extremely low*\u202for *undetectable* under current exposure limits.  A small number of studies and a few advocacy groups argue that the evidence is insufficient and that precautionary measures are warranted, especially because 5\u202fG introduces higher\u2011frequency millimetre\u2011wave (mmWave) bands and a denser network of small cells.\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, side\u2011by\u2011side overview** of the main arguments, the strongest evidence supporting each side, where scientific consensus lies, and where genuine uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What \u201c5\u2011G cell towers\u201d actually emit\n\n| Feature | Typical values for a macro\u2011cell tower (the large steel structures) | Typical values for a \u201csmall cell\u201d or \u201cfemto\u2011cell\u201d (the small boxes mounted on street furniture) |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Frequency bands used for 5\u202fG | \u2022 Sub\u20116\u202fGHz (e.g., 3.5\u202fGHz, 4.9\u202fGHz)  <br>\u2022 Occasionally 2\u202fGHz legacy band | \u2022 Sub\u20116\u202fGHz (same as macro)  <br>\u2022 mmWave (24\u201128\u202fGHz, 37\u201140\u202fGHz, 66\u201171\u202fGHz) |\n| Power output (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power, EIRP) | 10\u202f\u2013\u202f100\u202fW (typical) \u2013 up to a few hundred watts for rural sites | 0.1\u202f\u2013\u202f10\u202fW \u2013 usually <\u202f1\u202fW for indoor/urban deployments |\n| Beamforming / sectorization | Antennas are directional; the main beam points toward users, not straight down | Even more focused beams, especially at mmWave, that \u201cpaint\u201d a user\u2019s device only when it is nearby |\n| Typical public exposure (average whole\u2011body SAR) | <\u202f0.001\u202fW/kg, far below the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) limit of 0.08\u202fW/kg (general public, whole body) | Even lower, because the radiated power is tiny and the beam is highly localized |\n\n**Key point:** The RF power that reaches a person standing a few metres from a tower is *orders of magnitude* lower than the limits that have been set on the basis of decades of research on thermal (heat\u2011producing) effects.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

A flagship agency\u2019s official conclusion on 5\u202fG\n\n### World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 \u201cElectromagnetic fields and public health: 5G mobile networks\u201d (2022)\n\n| Item | What the document says (excerpt) | What it means in plain language |\n|------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Overall safety judgment** | \u201cTo date, no adverse health effect has been established as being caused by exposure to the RF fields below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). The limits are set to protect against all established health effects, including those that could result from heating (thermal effects).\u201d | The WHO concludes that, **based on the best\u2011available scientific evidence up to 2022**, the exposure levels that the public receives from 5\u202fG base stations and hand\u2011held devices are **well within safety margins**. |\n| **Cancer risk** | \u201cThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified RF electromagnetic fields as \u2018possibly carcinogenic to humans\u2019 (Group\u202f2B). This classification is based on limited evidence for a link between heavy, long\u2011term mobile\u2011phone use and glioma. No epidemiological evidence links 5\u202fG\u2011specific frequencies or tower exposures to cancer.\u201d | The only carcinogenic classification is a *cautious* one (Group\u202f2B) that applies to **all** RF exposure, not specifically to 5\u202fG. Large population studies of mobile\u2011phone users have not shown a consistent increase in brain tumours, and no study has yet examined 5\u202fG towers directly. |\n| **Non\u2011thermal effects** (e.g., DNA damage, oxidative stress) | \u201cLaboratory studies reporting non\u2011thermal biological changes are generally not reproducible, are performed at exposure levels far above those encountered by the general public, or lack proper dosimetry. Current evidence does not support a causal link between low\u2011level RF exposure and adverse health outcomes.\u201d | Small\u2011scale lab results that suggest \u201csomething happening at the cellular level\u201d have not held up under rigorous, blinded replication, especially at the low power levels that people actually experience. |\n| **Precautionary approach** | \u201cWHO recommends that governments and regulators continue to monitor the scientific literature and update exposure guidelines if new robust evidence emerges. In the meantime, the existing guidelines are considered protective.\u201d | The agency is *open* to changing limits if future high\u2011quality data demand it, but presently the limits are deemed sufficient. |\n\n**Where to find the full text**  \n- WHO fact sheet, \u201c5G mobile networks\u201d (PDF, 2022): https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/5g-mobile-networks  \n- WHO\u2019s \u201cElectromagnetic fields and public health\u201d webpage, which links to the full background report and to the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines: https://www.who.int/health\u2011topics/electromagnetic\u2011fields  \n\n---\n\n### How WHO\u2019s conclusion fits with other major bodies\n\n| Agency | Year | Core statement (summary) | Consensus with WHO |\n|--------|------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| **International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)** | 2020 (updated 2022) | \u201cCurrent exposure limits protect against all established health effects.
