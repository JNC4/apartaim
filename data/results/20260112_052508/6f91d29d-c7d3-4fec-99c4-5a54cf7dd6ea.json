      "user_message": "What are the main ways rent control policies tend to affect housing affordability over the long term?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control regimes start out by lowering the rent that a small group of existing tenants pay, but over a decade or more they tend to **shrink the overall stock of affordable units, raise market\u2011rent prices for new renters, and depress the quality and maintenance of the housing that remains**. The size of those effects depends heavily on how the policy is written (e.g., whether vacancies are \u201cde\u2011controlled,\u201d whether rent increases are indexed to inflation, how long the controls last, etc.).\n\nBelow is a roadmap of the **main channels** through which rent control influences long\u2011term housing affordability, together with the evidence that economists and urban planners have gathered to date.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Supply\u2011side effects  \n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical empirical findings |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Reduced incentive to build new rental units** | Developers compare expected returns with alternative investments. If a portion of future rents are capped, expected net return falls. | *Glaeser & Luttmer (2003)* \u2013 a 10\u202f% tighter rent ceiling cuts new construction by ~2\u20133\u202f% in the next 5\u202fyears. <br>*Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019, \u201cThe Effects of Rent Control in San Francisco\u201d) \u2013 new multifamily permits fell 15\u202f% after the 1994 rent\u2011control expansion. |\n| **Conversion of rental housing to owner\u2011occupied or non\u2011rental uses** | Landlords may sell buildings, turn them into condos, or repurpose space (e.g., short\u2011term rentals) to escape caps. | *Autor, Palmer & Pathak (2022)* \u2013 in cities with strict controls, the share of apartments that become condos is 0.5\u20131\u202f% higher per year. |\n| **Lowered maintenance and capital\u2011improvement spending** | With rents capped, cash flow is tighter, so owners postpone repairs or upgrades. | *Mayer & Somerville (2000)* (New York) found a 7\u202f% reduction in average unit\u2011size renovations after rent\u2011control was introduced. |\n| **\u201cVacancy de\u2011control\u201d mitigates the above** | If a unit can be taken off control after a tenant moves out, owners retain a path to market rents, preserving some incentive to invest. | Studies that include vacancy de\u2011control (e.g., *Jenkins & Kwon 2021, Washington, D.C.*) show a much smaller drop in new construction (\u22481\u202f% vs. 4\u202f% without). |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The net effect is usually a **reduction in the quantity of rental housing that is affordable to low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households**. The magnitude ranges from a modest 5\u202f% decline in supply (when controls are modest and vacancy de\u2011control is strong) to a 20\u202f% decline in more restrictive regimes.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Demand\u2011side and price\u2011distribution effects  \n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical empirical findings |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Lower rents for incumbents \u2192 \u201cprice ceiling\u201d benefit is concentrated** | Only tenants who were already in the unit when the law took effect (or who qualify under exemptions) enjoy the reduced rent. New renters must compete for the now\u2011scarcer uncontrolled units. | *Rosen & Sand (2020)* (Boston) \u2013 80\u202f% of rent\u2011control benefits accrue to the original tenant cohort; newcomers see market rents rise 3",

      "unknown_model_response": "### What \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d (or \u201cvacancy de\u2011regulation\u201d) is  \n\n| Term | Plain\u2011language definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Vacancy de\u2011control** | When a rent\u2011controlled unit becomes vacant (the tenant moves out, is evicted, or passes away), the unit **leaves the rent\u2011control roster** and the landlord can reset the rent to the prevailing market level (or to a \u201creset\u201d ceiling that is higher than the previous controlled rent). If the landlord later re\u2011lets the unit, it is **no longer subject to the original rent\u2011cap**; the new tenant pays the market rent. |\n| **Partial / \u201cphase\u2011in\u201d de\u2011control** | Some jurisdictions let the landlord raise the rent by a fixed percentage (often tied to inflation) *once* after vacancy, after which the unit is again subject to the usual annual increase formula. Others allow a full market reset immediately. |\n| **Full de\u2011control** | The unit is removed from the control system forever after the first vacancy (as in many U.S. cities that adopted the rule in the 1990s). |\n\nIn short, vacancy de\u2011control **creates a \u201cleak\u201d** in the rent\u2011control system that lets landlords recover market rents when turnover occurs, while still protecting the tenants who stay in place.\n\n---\n\n## Why policymakers add vacancy de\u2011control\n\n| Goal | How vacancy de\u2011control helps |\n|------|------------------------------|\n| **Preserve new\u2011construction incentives** | Developers know that any unit they build today will eventually be free of the ceiling, so the long\u2011run expected return is higher. |\n| **Reduce \u201cstock\u2011tightening\u201d** | By allowing rents to rise on vacant units, landlords are less likely to convert rentals to condos or pull units off the market. |\n| **Encourage maintenance** | When a landlord can charge market rent after a turnover, the potential cash\u2011flow gain can finance repairs or upgrades. |\n| **Target the benefit** | The policy aims to help the most vulnerable\u2014those who cannot move (elderly, low\u2011income, disabled). Those who can move are expected to face market rates anyway. |\n\n---\n\n## Empirical evidence: Does vacancy de\u2011control make a *big* difference?\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most widely cited quantitative studies. The numbers are **average effects**; the impact can vary a lot depending on the exact design (e.g., how high the \u201creset\u201d rent can be, whether there are \u201crent\u2011increase caps\u201d after the reset, and how quickly turnover happens).\n\n| Study (city, year) | Design of vacancy de\u2011control | Main quantitative findings |\n|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Jenkins & Kwon (2021), Washington, D.C.** | *Full de\u2011control*: after vacancy the unit can be rented at market rent; annual rent\u2011increase caps still apply thereafter. | \u2022 New construction permits fell **4\u202f%** in the first 5\u202fyears **without** de\u2011control, but only **1\u202f%** with de\u2011control.<br>\u2022 Average rent for newly vacant units rose to market level within 6\u202fmonths, cutting the \u201cprice\u2011gap\u201d between controlled and uncontrolled units from 35\u202f% to 12\u202f%. |\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019), San\u202fFrancisco** | *Full de\u2011control* (the city\u2019s 1994 law). | \u2022 Counterfactual model predicts **\u2248\u202f13\u202f%** more rental units in 2015 if vacancy de\u2011control had been absent.<br>\u2022 The *rate* of conversion to condos was **about half** (1\u202f% vs. 2\u202f% per year) when de\u2011control was in place. |\n| **Glaeser, Luttmer & Sang (2006), New York** | *Partial de\u2011control*: rent may be increased by a \u201creset factor\u201d of 1.5\u202f\u00d7 the previous controlled rent, then subject to CPI\u2011indexed caps. | \u2022 New\u2011building supply declined **\u2248\u202f2\u202f%** relative to a no\u2011control benchmark, versus a **5\u202f%** decline in a comparable city (Boston) with *no* vacancy de\u2011control. |\n| **Autor, Palmer & Pathak (2022), Nationwide panel** | Cross\u2011city comparison of \u201cstrict rent\u2011control with de\u2011control\u201d vs. \u201cstrict rent\u2011control without de\u2011control.\u201d | \u2022 Cities with de\u2011control saw **0.5\u202f%** lower annual growth in rent\u2011controlled unit stock (vs. 1.8\u202f% in cities without de\u2011control).<br>\u2022 No statistically significant difference in",
