What is Quantitative Easing (QE)?\n\n| Element | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Goal** | When short\u2011term policy rates are already near zero (the \u201czero\u2011lower bound\u201d), central banks buy large amounts of longer\u2011term securities (government bonds, mortgage\u2011backed securities, corporate bonds). The aim is to lower longer\u2011term yields, stimulate borrowing and spending, and keep inflation near target. |\n| **Typical assets bought** | \u2022 Sovereign bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasuries, UK Gilts) <br>\u2022 Agency\u2011MBS (U.S. mortgage\u2011backed securities) <br>\u2022 Corporate bonds (in later rounds) |\n| **Balance\u2011sheet expansion** | Central bank assets increase; commercial\u2011bank reserves rise, but banks do not necessarily lend more\u2014hence the importance of \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d and \u201csignalling\u201d channels. |\n| **Key transmission channels** | 1. **Interest\u2011rate channel** \u2013 lowers long\u2011term yields \u2192 cheaper mortgages, corporate borrowing.<br>2. **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing channel** \u2013 investors sell the assets the central bank buys, buying riskier assets (stocks, high\u2011yield bonds, real estate).<br>3. **Expectations / signalling channel** \u2013 signals a commitment to keep rates low for an extended period, influencing forward\u2011looking decisions.<br>4. **Exchange\u2011rate channel** \u2013 lower yields attract capital outflows, depreciating the domestic currency, boosting net exports. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Those Channels Reach Different Groups\n\n### 2.1 Workers & Wage Earners  \n\n| Channel | Mechanism | Potential Distributional Outcome |\n|---------|-----------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Interest\u2011rate channel** | Lower corporate borrowing costs can stimulate investment, hiring, and wages, especially in interest\u2011sensitive sectors (construction, autos, housing). | **Positive** if firms pass cost savings into hiring/wages. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing channel** | Higher asset prices raise the net\u2011worth of households that own stocks, bonds, or real\u2011estate. | **Positive** for asset\u2011own",
