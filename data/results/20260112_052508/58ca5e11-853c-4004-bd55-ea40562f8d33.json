Theoretical Foundations\n\n| Theory | What it predicts for workers | Key assumptions |\n|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Comparative advantage (classical)** | Workers move to sectors where a country is relatively more efficient; total employment and wages rise in the long run. | Perfect mobility of labor, no adjustment costs, no market failures. |\n| **Heckscher\u2011Ohlin / Stolper\u2011Samuelson** | Trade raises the real wage of the abundant factor (usually low\u2011skill labor in developing nations) and lowers the real wage of the scarce factor (often high\u2011skill labor in those same nations). | Factor prices fully adjust, no institutional frictions. |\n| **New\u2011trade\u2011theory (monopolistic competition)** | Trade expands market size, encouraging firms to specialize, invest in R&D, and pay higher wages to attract skilled workers; low\u2011skill workers may face stagnant wages. | Presence of increasing returns, product differentiation, and firm heterogeneity. |\n| **Political\u2011economy / \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d** | Governments may lower labor standards to attract FDI; workers can suffer from weaker protections. | Weak institutions, competition among jurisdictions for investment. |\n| **Adjustment\u2011costs models** | Short\u2011run job loss and wage decline in contracting sectors; long\u2011run gains offset by reallocation to expanding sectors. | Presence of mobility frictions, skill mismatches, and limited retraining capacity. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Theories diverge mainly on *who* benefits (abundant vs. scarce factor) and *how fast* the economy can reallocate resources. Empirical work tries to see which set of assumptions most closely matches reality.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the Emp",

Each claim is flagged as **well\u2011established**, **debated**, or **still uncertain** and we note where the scholarly consensus lies, where the evidence is mixed, and which pieces of research tend to be under\u2011cited.  The goal is to give you a complete picture of what the data say about how FTAs affect workers in the signatory countries.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What an FTA does, in a nutshell\n| Feature | Typical content | Expected channel of impact on workers |\n|---------|----------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination** (goods & most services) | 0\u201115\u202f% duties phased out over 5\u201110\u202fyears | Lowers import prices \u2192 higher real wages for consumers; raises export\u2011oriented demand \u2192 creates jobs in export sectors. |\n| **Rules of origin** | Determines which inputs qualify for duty\u2011free treatment | Encourages \u201cregional value\u2011chains\u201d; can shift production to firms that can meet origin rules, sometimes displacing firms that cannot. |\n| **Investment\u2011protection chapters** | IP, dispute\u2011settlement, \u201cnational\u2011treatment\u201d | Attracts foreign direct investment (FDI); FDI can bring higher\u2011productivity jobs but also may crowd out domestic firms. |\n| **Labor\u2011standards provisions** (in most modern FTAs) | Minimum\u2011wage, collective\u2011bargaining, core ILO rights, monitoring mechanisms | Intended to raise baseline conditions; enforcement varies widely. |\n| **Dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms** | State\u2011to\u2011state or investor\u2011state arbitration | Can affect the willingness of governments to raise labor standards if they fear retaliation. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** FTAs change the *relative* cost of producing and selling goods across borders.
