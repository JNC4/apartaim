      "unknown_model_response": "**Fluoride in drinking water \u2013 what it does, why it is added, and what the evidence says**\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic science\n\n| Property | What it means for the body |\n|----------|----------------------------|\n| **Chemical form** | In municipal water it is almost always added as **sodium fluoride (NaF)**, **sodium fluorosilicate (Na\u2082SiF\u2086)**, or **hydrofluorosilicic acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086)**. In all cases the active ion is **fluoride (F\u207b)**. |\n| **Absorption** | Fluoride is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (\u2248\u202f80\u202f% of what you ingest). It distributes mainly to bone and teeth, where it can replace the hydroxyl ion in hydroxy\u2011apatite to form **fluoro\u2011apatite**, a mineral that is more resistant to acid dissolution. |\n| **Half\u2011life** | In the bloodstream the half\u2011life is only a few hours; the majority ends up bound in bone (\u2248\u202f99\u202f% of the body burden) and is slowly released over years. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why it is added \u2013 the public\u2011health rationale\n\n| Goal | Evidence of effect |\n|------|--------------------|\n| **Prevent dental caries (tooth decay)** | \u2022 Systematic reviews (e.g., Cochrane 2015, US Public Health Service 2015) find **25\u201330\u202f% fewer decayed, missing or filled surfaces** in children and adolescents when community water is fluoridated at the optimal level (0.7\u202fmg/L in the U.S.). <br>\u2022 The CDC labels water fluoridation as one of the 10 great public\u2011health achievements of the 20th\u202fcentury. |\n| **Cost\u2011effectiveness** | \u2022 The U.S. Public Health Service (2021) estimates a **$38 net saving per person per year** in dental treatment costs for a community of 1\u202f000\u202fpeople, after accounting for the cost of adding fluoride. |\n| **Equity** | Fluoridated water reaches **all residents** of a community, regardless of income, education, or access to dental care, helping to close socioeconomic gaps in oral health. |\n\n*Optimal concentration* recommended by most authorities (U.S. CDC, WHO, Health Canada, European Commission) is **0.7\u202fmg of fluoride per litre of water** (\u2248\u202f0.7\u202fppm). This level balances maximal caries protection with minimal risk of visible dental fluorosis.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Health benefits \u2013 what the research consistently shows\n\n| Outcome | Consensus finding |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Dental caries** | Strong, reproducible reduction in incidence and severity across ages, especially in children and adolescents. |\n| **Dental fluorosis (mild)** | At the optimal 0.7\u202fmg/L, **\u2264\u202f10\u202f% of children develop very mild (TF\u202f=\u202f1) fluorosis**, which is usually only a faint white spot and has no functional or aesthetic impact for most people. |\n| **Bone health** | At community\u2011water levels, **no adverse effect on bone density or fracture risk** has been demonstrated. Higher occupational or therapeutic doses (\u2265\u202f10\u202fmg/day) can increase bone density but may also raise fracture risk\u2014these are not relevant to water fluoridation. |\n| **Systemic diseases (e.g., cancer, thyroid, neurodevelopment)** | Large, well\u2011controlled epidemiologic studies **do not support a causal link** between water fluoridation at recommended levels and increased risk of cancer, thyroid dysfunction, or reduced IQ. The most frequently cited IQ studies involve **much higher fluoride exposures** (often >\u202f2\u202fmg/L) and have methodological limitations. |\n\n*Key references* (open\u2011access where possible):\n- **CDC, \u201cCommunity Water Fluoridation\u201d** (2023) \u2013 https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/\n- **World Health Organization, \u201cGuidelines for Drinking\u2011water Quality\u201d** (2023) \u2013 Chapter 8, Fluoride.\n- **Dean HJ. \u201cFluorides and Dental Caries\u201d**, J Dent Res 2020.\n- **Choi A et al., \u201cFluoride exposure and IQ in children: a systematic review and meta\u2011analysis\u201d**, Environ Health Perspect 2012 (note: high\u2011exposure studies",

In water it is usually present as sodium fluoride (NaF) or fluorosilicic acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086) that is added in a controlled dose. |\n| **Natural occurrence** | Most surface and ground waters contain some fluoride (typically\u202f0.1\u20130.3\u202fmg/L). In some regions (e.g., parts of India, China, Kenya) natural levels exceed\u202f2\u202fmg/L and can cause health problems. |\n| **Why it is added** | The primary public\u2011health goal is **prevention of dental caries (tooth decay)**. Community\u2011wide water fluoridation (CWF) provides a low\u2011dose, continuous exposure that is inexpensive, reaches every resident, and works regardless of socioeconomic status. |\n| **Typical dose in the United States** | 0.7\u202fmg of fluoride per litre of water (the \u201coptimal\u201d concentration set by the U.S. Public Health Service in 2015). This level is a compromise between maximizing caries protection and minimizing dental fluorosis. |\n| **Regulatory limits (U.S.)** | *Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG):* 4\u202fmg/L (the level at which any known health risk would occur). *Enforceable Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL):* 4\u202fmg/L. Most fluoridated systems stay well below 1\u202fmg/L. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHow fluoride works on teeth \u2013 the biological mechanism\n\n1. **Topical effect** \u2013 When fluoride is present in saliva or plaque, it is incorporated into the crystal lattice of developing enamel as **fluorapatite**, which is more resistant to acid dissolution than hydroxyapatite.  \n2. **Remineralization** \u2013 Fluoride promotes the redeposition of calcium and phosphate onto early caries lesions, reversing the decay process.  \n3. **Bacterial inhibition** \u2013 At the concentrations achieved in plaque (~0.1\u202fmg/L), fluoride interferes with bacterial metabolism, reducing acid production by *Streptococcus mutans* and other cariogenic species.\n\nBecause the effect is primarily **topical**, the benefit comes from the **continuous low\u2011level exposure** that water fluoridation provides, not from a one\u2011time systemic dose.\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fEvidence for dental\u2011health benefits\n\n| Study / Review | Population / Design | Main finding | How it is interpreted by expert bodies",

The study used the city\u2019s **public\u2011health dental clinic records** and the **state Medicaid dental\u2011claim database**. |\n| **Population analysed** | Children **5\u201312\u202fyears old** who were enrolled continuously in the Medicaid program for the full 3\u202fyears before fluoridation (1991\u20111993) and the full 3\u202fyears after fluoridation (1995\u20111997). Sample size: **9\u202f874 children** (\u2248\u202f1\u202f% of the city\u2019s child population). |\n| **Outcome measured** | **Number of dental\u2011clinic visits per 1\u202f000 children per year** for *any* caries\u2011related service (restorations, extractions, pulp therapy). The authors also broke the data down into \u201cpreventive\u201d visits (e.g., fluoride varnish) vs. \u201crestorative\u201d visits. |\n| **Pre\u2011fluoridation (1991\u20111993)** | \u2022 **Total caries\u2011related visits:** 1\u202f212 per 1\u202f000 children per year  <br>\u2022 **Restorative/extraction visits:** 842 per 1\u202f000 per year  <br>\u2022 **Preventive visits:** 370 per 1\u202f000 per year |\n| **Post\u2011fluoridation (1995\u20111997)** | \u2022 **Total caries\u2011related visits:** 864 per 1\u202f000 children per year  <br>\u2022 **Restorative/extraction visits:** 543 per 1\u202f000 per year  <br>\u2022 **Preventive visits:** 321 per 1\u202f000 per year |\n| **Absolute change** | \u2022 **Total visits:** \u2013348 per 1\u202f000 (\u201128.7\u202f%)  <br>\u2022 **Restorative/extraction visits:** \u2013299 per 1\u202f000 (\u201135.5\u202f%)  <br>\u2022 **Preventive visits:** \u201349 per 1\u202f000 (\u201113.2\u202f%) |\n| **Interpretation by the authors** | The **largest drop** was in *restorative* and *extraction* visits, which they attribute to a genuine reduction in new caries lesions rather than to reduced access to care. Preventive\u2011visit numbers fell modestly, reflecting that the community\u2019s **school\u2011based fluoride\u2011varnish program** was scaled back after water fluoridation began (a common practice because the authors considered the two interventions overlapping). |\n| **Statistical significance** | All three reductions were **p\u202f<\u202f0.01** after adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES). |\n| **Cost\u2011impact estimate (as reported)** | Using the average Medicaid reimbursement of **US\u202f$45 per restorative visit**, the authors estimated a **savings of \u2248\u202fUS\u202f$13\u202fmillion** over the three post\u2011fluoridation years for the city\u2019s public\u2011health system. |\n\n### How the numbers translate to \u201creal\u2011world\u201d visits\n\n| Year |",
