      "unknown_model_response": "### Why the U.S. embargo on Cuba has **not** produced the political change Washington wanted  \n\n| Dimension | What happened in Cuba | How it differs from the anti\u2011apartheid campaign |\n|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Scope and multilateral backing** | \u2022 **Unilateral** \u2013 imposed almost exclusively by the United States (later copied by a handful of allies, but the United Nations General Assembly repeatedly voted **against** a comprehensive embargo). <br>\u2022 No UN Security\u2011Council resolution, no coordinated EU or major\u2011power effort. | \u2022 South\u2011Africa sanctions were **multilateral** (UN arms embargo + EU + U.S. + other \u201cWestern\u201d states). Multilateral pressure raises the *cost* of defiance and limits the target\u2019s ability to find substitute partners. |\n| **Targeted sectors vs. whole\u2011economy choke\u2011point** | \u2022 The embargo blocked most U.S. trade (\u2248\u202f$\u202f4\u202fbn/yr before 1960) and later restricted travel, finance, and most imports of food, medicine, and industrial equipment. <br>\u2022 However, **the bulk of Cuba\u2019s trade quickly shifted to the Soviet bloc (1960s\u201180s) and, after 1991, to the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and China**. | \u2022 In South Africa, the sanctions hit the *core* revenue streams\u2014gold, diamonds, oil, and the financial system that even allies relied on. There were few viable alternative markets for those commodities. |\n| **Regime\u2019s fiscal resilience** | \u2022 **Soviet subsidies** (cheap oil, food, credit) covered 30\u201140\u202f% of Cuba\u2019s import bill from the early 1970s until the USSR collapsed. <br>\u2022 After the \u201cSpecial Period\u201d (1991\u20111995) the government survived by opening limited tourism, attracting remittances, and liberalising certain state\u2011owned enterprises. | \u2022 The apartheid government could not replace the lost export earnings; its fiscal base eroded rapidly, forcing it to negotiate. |\n| **Political cohesion of the ruling elite** | \u2022 The Cuban Communist Party is a **single\u2011party, ideologically unified organization** that views the embargo as a *nationalist rallying\u2011point* (\u201cthe imperialist blockade\u201d). <br>\u2022 Elite incentives to compromise are weak because the regime\u2019s legitimacy is framed around resistance to U.S. pressure. | \u2022 South Africa\u2019s ruling National Party was a coalition of business\u2011friendly whites, military officers, and technocrats who could be split by economic pain; many elites feared capital flight and loss of foreign investment. |\n| **Domestic political constraints in the sanctioning country** | \u2022 U.S. domestic politics made the embargo **hard to lift**: the Cuban\u2011exile lobby, anti\u2011communist sentiment, and later the \u201cBiden\u2011Trump\u201d bipartisan consensus turned the embargo into a symbolic issue. <br>\u2022 This \u201cpolitical lock\u2011in\u201d limited the ability to *adjust* the policy (e.g., to offer a \u201ccarrot\u201d for reforms). | \u2022 In the 1980s, U.S. and European leaders could agree on a *conditional* sanctions package: lift the embargo *if* apartheid ended. The policy was flexible, allowing a clear \u201creward\u201d for compliance. |\n| **Humanitarian exemptions and unintended consequences** | \u2022 **Broad exemptions are limited**; many medicines and medical equipment still require a special license, creating chronic shortages. <br>\u2022 The humanitarian impact (e.g., shortages of insulin, dialysis equipment) has generated international criticism but also **bolstered the regime\u2019s narrative** that the U.S. is responsible for suffering. | \u2022 Anti\u2011apartheid sanctions deliberately built **large humanitarian carve\u2011outs** (food, medicines, basic consumer goods). The humanitarian cost was kept low, preserving moral legitimacy and avoiding a \u201cvictim\u2011blaming\u201d narrative. |\n| **Strategic signaling vs. coercion** | \u2022 The embargo is largely **symbolic**: it signals U.S. opposition to socialism/communism, but the material cost to the Cuban leadership has been *relatively modest* after the 1990s. <br>\u2022 Cuba has survived on tourism, remittances, and limited market reforms, which the embargo does not directly affect. | \u2022 The anti\u2011apartheid sanctions were designed as **coercive** tools that directly threatened the regime\u2019s *core* economic survival, making the cost of non\u2011compliance",
