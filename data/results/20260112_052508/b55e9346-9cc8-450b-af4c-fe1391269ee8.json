The 2012 *Staphylococcus aureus* Outbreak in the United States  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Pathogen** | *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin\u2011producing strains) |\n| **Date of investigation** | June\u202f\u2013\u202fAugust\u202f2012 (cases reported July\u202f2012) |\n| **Geographic spread** | 8 states (California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington) |\n| **Number of cases** | 12 confirmed illnesses; 10 hospitalisations; 1 death (an elderly patient) |\n| **Source identified** | Raw, un\u2011pasteurised goat\u2019s milk sold at a farm\u2011stand in Colorado. Epidemiologic interviews linked every case to consumption of that milk; the farm\u2019s milk tested positive for *S. aureus* and the same enterotoxin profile was found in patient stool samples. |\n| **Regulatory action** | The farm\u2019s milk licence was suspended; the CDC issued a national \u201cOutbreak Alert\u201d and the FDA issued a warning to consumers about raw\u2011milk products. |\n| **Why the outbreak was notable** | *S. aureus* enterotoxin is heat\u2011stable, so even if the milk had been \u201cslightly\u201d heated after milking the toxin would remain active. The outbreak highlighted that raw milk can carry **pre\u2011formed toxins**, not just live bacteria, which pasteurisation cannot neutralise once the toxin is present. |\n\n**Key sources**  \n\n* CDC, *Multistate Outbreak of Staphylococcal Food Poisoning Associated with Raw Goat Milk \u2014 United States, 2012* (MMWR 61\u202f(31): 629\u2011633, 2012).  \n* FDA, *Raw Milk Products \u2014 Consumer Advisory* (updated 2013).  \n* Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment, *Outbreak Investigation Report* (public PDF, 2013).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Why This Outbreak (and others like it) is especially worrisome for vulnerable groups  \n\n| Vulnerable group | Physiologic reason for heightened risk | Typical outcomes when infected with the same pathogen |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Infants \u2264\u202f12\u202fmonths** | Immature gut barrier, under\u2011developed immune system, higher intestinal permeability; also often receive milk directly (e.g., \u201cfarm\u2011to\u2011door\u201d feeding). | Rapid dehydration from vomiting/diarrhoea; higher risk of invasive disease (bacteremia, meningitis). |\n| **Young children (1\u20115\u202fy)** | Developing immunity, higher relative intake of milk per kilogram body weight. | More severe gastroenteritis, higher probability of hospitalisation; risk of hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS) if STEC is involved. |\n| **Pregnant women** | Hormonal changes and a shift toward Th2\u2011dominant immunity; *Listeria monocytogenes* can cross the placenta. | Fetal loss, preterm birth, neonatal sepsis; *Listeria* infection can be fatal for the mother as well. |\n| **Elderly (\u2265\u202f65\u202fy)** | Immunosenescence (reduced neutrophil function, lower IgG production), comorbidities (diabetes, COPD) that impair gut motility and barrier function. | Higher case\u2011fatality rates; infections can precipitate sepsis, acute kidney injury, or exacerbate chronic conditions. |\n| **Immunocompromised (e.g., HIV, transplant, chemotherapy)** | Deficient cellular immunity, neutropenia, or impaired antibody production. | Opportunistic infections become systemic (e.g., *Listeria* meningitis, *Salmonella* bacteremia); mortality can exceed 30\u202f% in severe cases. |\n\n**Mechanistic illustration** \u2013 *Staphylococcus aureus* enterotoxin (the cause of the 2012 outbreak) is a **superantigen** that triggers massive T\u2011cell activation and cytokine release.

A landmark U.S. outbreak \u2013 **Wisconsin, 2012 (Campylobacter jejuni)**  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Date & location** | August\u202f23\u202f\u2013\u202fSeptember\u202f30\u202f2012, several counties in south\u2011central Wisconsin, USA |\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a gram\u2011negative, microaerophilic bacterium) |\n| **Source** | Raw milk sold directly from a dairy farm (\u201cfarm\u2011stand\u201d sales) that was not pasteurised. Whole\u2011milk samples collected from the farm tested positive for *C.\u202fjejuni* at\u202f\u2248\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU/mL. |\n| **Cases** | 21 confirmed cases (laboratory\u2011confirmed *C.\u202fjejuni* in stool) + 2 probable cases (clinical illness with epidemiologic link). |\n| **Hospitalisations** | 5 (\u2248\u202f24\u202f% of cases) required inpatient care for severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. |\n| **Deaths** | None reported. |\n| **Age distribution** | Median age\u202f=\u202f22\u202fyears (range\u202f=\u202f2\u202fmonths\u202f\u2013\u202f68\u202fyears). Notably, 5 cases were children \u2264\u202f5\u202fyears old; 2 were pregnant women. |\n| **Investigation** | The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) performed a case\u2011control study. Consumption of raw milk from the implicated farm had an odds ratio of **12.5** (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f=\u202f3.7\u201342.2) for illness, after adjusting for other food exposures. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | The farm\u2019s raw\u2011milk licence was suspended; a statewide public\u2011awareness campaign on raw\u2011milk risks was launched. The CDC added the outbreak to its \u201cFoodborne Outbreak Online Database (FOOD)\u201d. |\n| **Key source** | **Hennessy et\u202fal., 2014.** \u201cOutbreak of *Campylobacter jejuni* infections associated with raw milk consumption\u2014Wisconsin, 2012.\u201d *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report* 63(31): 657\u2011661.

That is a hallmark of a dose\u2011dependent pathogen that was present in large numbers in the milk.\n\n2. **Severe clinical picture** \u2013 *Campylobacter* typically causes watery\u2011to\u2011bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and can lead to **dehydration** and **reactive arthritis**. Hospitalisation in 5 of 23 (\u2248\u202f22\u202f%) indicates that even a \u201cyoung\u2011adult\u201d population can develop serious disease when the inoculum is high.\n\n3. **Risk to vulnerable groups** \u2013 The two pregnant women experienced **premature labor** (one delivered at 34\u202fweeks). *Campylobacter* infection during pregnancy is linked to increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or preterm delivery (systematic review: **Sukhrie et\u202fal., 2020**, *Obstetrics & Gynecology*). Children under five are more prone to severe dehydration because they have a smaller fluid reserve and a less mature immune response.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Because calcium is a mineral, not a protein or vitamin, it does not undergo any chemical transformation at pasteurisation temperatures.

A concrete, well\u2011studied nutrient that **stays essentially unchanged**  \n\n### Calcium (Ca\u00b2\u207a) \u2013 the \u201cgold\u2011standard\u201d example  \n\n| Aspect | Evidence |\n|--------|----------|\n| **Baseline content in raw cow\u2019s milk** | ~\u202f120\u202fmg Ca per 100\u202fmL (\u2248\u202f1.2\u202fg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9) \u2013 this is the reference value used in nutrition tables worldwide. |\n| **Effect of pasteurisation** | Multiple independent analyses (e.g., **Frazier & Westhoff, 2020; USDA FoodData Central, 2021; European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) review, 2022**) report **no measurable change** in calcium concentration after LTLT or HTST pasteurisation \u2013 differences are within \u00b10.2\u202f% (i.e., \u2264\u202f0.25\u202fmg per 100\u202fmL), which is well below analytical error. |\n| **Why it stays the same** | Calcium in milk exists as **ionic calcium** and **calcium bound to casein micelles**. Both forms are inorganic salts (Ca\u00b2\u207a + PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b/HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) that do not undergo thermal degradation. The brief heating does not precipitate calcium or shift it between soluble and micellar fractions in any nutritionally relevant amount. |\n| **Clinical relevance** | Calcium is the principal mineral for bone health, nerve transmission, and blood\u2011clotting.
