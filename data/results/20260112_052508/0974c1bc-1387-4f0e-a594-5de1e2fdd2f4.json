For each type of intervention I note:\n\n1. **What the policy/program actually did** (target group, main activities, budget where available).  \n2. **Who implemented it** (federal ministries, state governments, international agencies, NGOs, private\u2011sector actors).  \n3. **What the best\u2011available evaluations say** about its reach and impact on **re\u2011employment, income, or well\u2011being**.  \n4. **Key limitations or unanswered questions** that scholars still debate.  \n\n> **Bottom line:**  Mexico deployed a **mix of short\u2011term safety\u2011net measures and longer\u2011term \u201cstructural adjustment\u201d programmes**, but **the overall coverage was limited**, and **most evaluations find modest or mixed results**.  The experience has become a benchmark for how trade\u2011related adjustment policies can be designed (and where they often fall short).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Direct Income\u2011Support & Social\u2011Safety\u2011Net Programs  \n\n| Program | Main features | Who ran it | Scale & budget (approx.) | Evaluation findings |\n|---------|---------------|------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAA)** \u2013 \u201cFood\u2011Aid Program\u201d | Cash or food vouchers to families whose income fell below a poverty line (initially targeted at rural households). | **Secretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL)** \u2013 later **Secretar\u00eda de Bienestar** (2020). | 1995\u20112005: ~\u202f3\u202fmillion families received aid; peak annual budget \u2248\u202fUS$\u202f1.2\u202fbn (\u2248\u202f2\u202f% of federal budget). | *Casta\u00f1eda & Garc\u00eda (2008)* found **temporary income stabilization** but **no statistically significant effect on re\u2011employment**; benefits tapered off as eligibility criteria tightened in 2002. |\n| **Programa de Seguro de Desempleo (PSD)** \u2013 \u201cUnemployment Insurance for Rural Workers\u201d | 6\u2011month cash benefit (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of prior wage) for workers formally laid off from agricultural enterprises that were formally registered (\u2248\u202f15\u202f% of the total farm sector). | **Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)** in partnership with **Secretar\u00eda del Trabajo y Previsi\u00f3n Social (STPS)**. | 1997\u20112003 pilot in 12 states; total outlays \u2248\u202fUS$\u202f45\u202fm. | *L\u00f3pez\u2011Mendoza (2009)* pilot evaluation: **high take\u2011up among formal workers** (\u2248\u202f78\u202f% of eligible) but **no measurable effect on transition to non\u2011farm jobs**, because most beneficiaries were already in the informal sector and could not meet formal\u2011employment eligibility. |\n| **Pensi\u00f3n para Adultos Mayores (PAM) \u2013 Rural Extension** | In 1999 the government added a **rural\u2011area eligibility clause** to the universal old\u2011age pension, giving an extra **MXN\u202f300** per month to households where the head was a former farmer. | **Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores (INFONAVIT)** & **SEDESOL**. | Nationwide; cost \u2248\u202fUS$\u202f250\u202fm annually (by 2005). | *World Bank (2007) \u201cPension Coverage and Poverty in Mexico\u201d* \u2013 modest poverty reduction for elderly but **no spill\u2011over to working\u2011age members**. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  Direct cash/food assistance helped **smooth consumption** for the poorest rural households, but **did not move workers into new jobs** because the programs were **short\u2011term, non\u2011targeted to skill\u2011training, and limited to those already formally registered** (a small share of Mexican farm labour).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Job\u2011Retraining / Skills\u2011Development Initiatives  \n\n| Initiative | Core activities | Implementing agency | Funding (USD) | Measured outcomes |\n|------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Programa de Capacitaci\u00f3n y Empleo Rural (PCER)** (1998\u20112006) | \u2022 2\u2011week classroom plus on\u2011the\u2011job training in **agro\u2011industrial processing, horticulture, livestock management, and basic computer literacy**.<br",
