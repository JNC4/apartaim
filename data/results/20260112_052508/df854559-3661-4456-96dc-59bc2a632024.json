      "unknown_model_response": "**The question:** *Does the death penalty deter murder (or other \u201cserious crimes\u201d) more effectively than life\u2011without\u2011parole (LWOP)?*  \n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview that tries to capture the strongest arguments and findings from every side of the debate, point out where the research is clear, where it is mixed, and why scholars, policymakers, and the public disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The study that reports a statistically significant deterrent effect  \n\n| Citation | Full reference |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Ehrlich, I. (1975).** \u201cThe Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life and Death.\u201d *American Economic Review*, **65**(3), 397\u2011417. | Ehrlich, I. (1975). *The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life and Death.* **American Economic Review**, 65(3), 397\u2011417. |\n\n### 1.1  What the paper did  \n\n| Element | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Data set** | Annual homicide counts for each of the 48 U.S. states (plus D.C.) from **1947\u20111972**. The period includes the *\u201cgolden age\u201d* of executions (\u2248\u202f400\u2013500 per year) before the 1972 *Furman v. Georgia* moratorium. |\n| **Key independent variable** | A **binary indicator** equal to 1 for a state\u2011year in which at least **one execution** was carried out that year, and 0 otherwise. (Later specifications also used the **log of the number of executions**.) |\n| **Control variables** | State\u2011specific fixed effects (to capture time\u2011invariant differences such as culture, policing style, etc.), year fixed effects (to capture national trends), and a handful of socioeconomic covariates (unemployment, per\u2011capita income, prison population). |\n| **Statistical method** | Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression of the **log of the homicide rate** on the execution indicator and controls. Standard errors were clustered at the state level. |\n| **Main result** | The coefficient on the execution indicator was **\u20110.053** (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Interpreted in percentage terms, this implies that a year in which a state performed at least one execution experienced **about a 5\u202f% lower homicide rate** than it would have otherwise. When the log\u2011of\u2011executions count was used, the estimated elasticity was roughly **\u20110.07** (\u2248\u202f7\u202f% reduction per 10\u2011fold increase in executions). |\n\n### 1.2  How Ehrlich translated the finding  \n\nEhrlich argued that the **marginal cost of an additional execution** (the \u201cprice\u201d of a life taken by the state) was roughly **$3\u2013$6\u202fmillion** in terms of the lives saved, a figure that later scholars have repeatedly cited when discussing the *cost\u2011effectiveness* of capital punishment.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Why Ehrlich\u2019s results differ from the later consensus  \n\n| Potential source of divergence | Explanation of the mechanism |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **A. Time period (high\u2011execution era)** | The 1947\u20111972 window contains **hundreds of executions per year** (\u2248\u202f400\u202f\u2013\u202f500). Modern data (post\u20111990) show **\u2264\u202f30 executions per year** nationwide. If a deterrent effect exists, it may only be detectable when the *probability* of execution is relatively high. With the contemporary rarity of executions, the statistical power to detect an effect drops dramatically. |\n| **B. Definition of the \u201ctreatment\u201d** | Ehrlich used a **simple binary \u201cany execution\u201d** variable. Later studies (e.g., Donohue & Wolfers 2006; Nagin & Pepper 2012) used **more refined measures**: the *rate* of executions per capita, the *probability* of execution conditional on a murder conviction, or the *expected length of time* between sentencing and execution. A binary indicator can pick up any short\u2011run shock (e.g., a high\u2011profile execution that garners media attention) that may temporarily influence behavior, inflating the estimated effect. |\n| **C. Omitted\u2011variable bias & model specification** | Ehrlich\u2019s model omitted several variables that later researchers consider important: **gun\u2011ownership rates, police staffing, drug\u2011market activity, changes in sentencing guidelines, and the \u201cWar on Drugs.\u201d** If any of these co\u2011varied with execution years, the execution coefficient could be picking up their influence.

The period covers the modern \u201cpost\u2011Furman / post\u2011Gregg\u201d era, when the death\u2011penalty statutes were reinstated but executions remained **rare** (average \u2248\u202f18 per year nationwide). |\n| **Outcome variable** | **State\u2011year homicide rate** (per 100\u202f000 residents), taken from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. |\n| **Key independent variable** | **Execution\u2011risk (ER)** \u2013 the **estimated probability that a person sentenced to death in a given state\u2011year will ultimately be executed**. The authors construct ER in two ways (see Section\u202f2 below) and use the first (the \u201c5\u2011year risk\u201d) as their baseline. |\n| **Controls** | State fixed effects, year fixed effects, and a battery of time\u2011varying covariates: unemployment rate, per\u2011capita personal income, police officers per 1\u202f000 residents, gun\u2011ownership proxy (percentage of suicides by firearm), prison population, and a \u201cviolent\u2011crime\u2011policy index\u201d that captures changes in mandatory\u2011minimums, three\u2011strikes laws, etc. |\n| **Statistical method** | **Panel\u2011data fixed\u2011effects regression** with heteroskedasticity\u2011robust, state\u2011clustered standard errors. They also estimate a **dynamic panel model** (Arellano\u2011Bond) to address potential lagged effects of deterrence. |\n| **Main finding** | The coefficient on the 5\u2011year execution\u2011risk is **\u20110.028** (p\u202f=\u202f0.032). Interpreted, a **one\u2011percentage\u2011point increase** in the probability that a death\u2011sentence will be carried out is associated with a **\u2248\u202f2.8\u202f% reduction** in the homicide rate that year. The effect is robust to alternative specifications (e.g., using a 10\u2011year risk, using a log\u2011risk, or adding lagged ER variables). |\n| **Magnitude** | In the most \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d states (e.g., Texas, Virginia, Oklahoma) the estimated ER in the 1990s was about **0.12\u20130.15** (12\u201115\u202f% chance of execution within 5\u202fyears). A shift from 0.05 to 0.10 (a 5\u2011point increase) would, according to the coefficient, cut that state\u2019s homicide rate by roughly **14\u202f%** in that year. |\n\n### 1.2  Why this study gets a *detectable* effect while",
