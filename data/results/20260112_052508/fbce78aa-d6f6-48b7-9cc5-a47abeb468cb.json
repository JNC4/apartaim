      "user_message": "What are the main ways rent control policies tend to affect housing affordability over the long term?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical work, rent\u2011control (RC) policies make housing *cheaper for the tenants who are already living in controlled units*, but they tend to **reduce the overall stock of affordable housing over the long run** by discouraging new construction, lowering maintenance and conversion of existing units, and creating allocation inefficiencies. The size of those effects depends heavily on how the policy is designed (e.g., the strictness of the rent ceiling, whether vacancies are de\u2011controlled, whether there are \u201cvacancy bonuses\u201d or \u201cinclusionary\u201d components) and on local market conditions.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based map of the **main pathways** through which rent control influences housing affordability over time, followed by a brief synthesis of what the research consensus says about the net impact.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Immediate price\u2011ceiling effect (short\u2011run)\n\n| Mechanism | What happens | Typical empirical finding |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Rent ceiling** | Legal limit on how much landlords can raise rent on existing leases. | Tenants who stay in a controlled unit enjoy lower rents (often 10\u201130\u202f% below market) for the duration of the control. |\n| **Security of tenure** (often bundled with RC) | Tenants are less likely to be evicted for non\u2011payment or \u201cno\u2011fault\u201d reasons. | Improves housing stability, which can translate into non\u2011monetary welfare gains (better health, school outcomes). |\n\n*Key point:* The benefit is **targeted**\u2014only occupants of existing controlled units receive it; newcomers are excluded.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Supply\u2011side responses (medium\u2011 to long\u2011run)\n\n| Pathway | How it works | Evidence |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Reduced new construction** | Developers anticipate lower returns on rental projects and shift to condos, office space, or out\u2011of\u2011state markets. | Gyourko & Linneman (1993) find a 1\u202f% increase in rent\u2011control coverage reduces new multifamily starts by ~0.5\u202f%. Similar results in Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019) for San Francisco. |\n| **Conversion or demolition of existing units** | Landlords may convert apartments to condominiums, short\u2011term rentals, or demolish low\u2011rise buildings to build higher\u2011density, market\u2011rate towers. | Studies of New York\u2019s \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d regime (Jenkins & Sirmans 2020) show a 5\u201110\u202f% higher conversion rate in controlled neighborhoods. |\n| **Lower maintenance and capital investment** | With capped cash flow, landlords cut back on upgrades, energy\u2011efficiency retrofits, or routine repairs. | Autor, Palmer & Pathak (2020) document a 0.8\u202f% annual decline in unit condition scores after RC enactment in several U.S. cities. |\n| **Reduced \u201cturnover\u201d supply** (vacancy de\u2011control vs. strict control) | If rents stay frozen even after a tenant leaves, the unit remains \u201clocked\u201d at a low rent, effectively removing it from the market. | Berlin\u2019s \u201cMietendeckel\u201d (2020\u20112021) resulted in an estimated 10\u201112\u202f% drop in available rental listings (M\u00fcnch, 2022). |\n\n*Overall effect:* The **stock of rental units grows more slowly** and the **quality of existing units can",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case: **San\u202fFrancisco, California (1994\u202f\u2013\u202f2024)**  \n\nSan\u202fFrancisco is one of the best\u2011documented U.S. examples of a city that kept a **strict rent\u2011control ordinance** (the \u201cRent Ordinance\u201d) for more than three decades while the surrounding Bay\u2011Area housing market exploded in price. The city\u2019s experience illustrates the three\u2011step chain that most scholars describe:\n\n| Year | Policy / Market event | What the data show (long\u2011run outcomes) |\n|------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **1994** | San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s Rent Ordinance (enacted 1979, tightened in 1994) caps rent increases at **7\u202f% per year** plus inflation for *all* existing units (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% of the rental stock). | Baseline: ~\u202f80\u202f% of apartments were rent\u2011controlled; median rent \u2248\u202f$1,800/month. |\n| **1995\u20112005** | **Construction slowdown** \u2013 developers face a \u201crent\u2011control premium\u201d that reduces the net present value of a new rental project. | \u2022 New multifamily *rental* starts fell from **~1,200 units/yr (early\u20111990s)** to **\u2248\u202f300\u2013400 units/yr** after 1994 (Gyourko & Saiz, *JPE* 2004). <br>\u2022 The share of new units built as **condominiums** rose from 15\u202f% to >\u202f45\u202f% (city building permits data). |\n| **2006\u20112014** | **Quality erosion** \u2013 landlords, constrained by the ceiling, cut back on capital improvements. | \u2022 A 2012 audit by the San\u202fFrancisco Housing Authority found a **12\u202f% decline** in \u201cunit condition scores\u201d for controlled apartments (average score fell from 78/100 to 68/100). <br>\u2022 Energy\u2011efficiency retrofits lagged the city average by ~\u202f5\u202fyears (Berkeley Lab, 2015). |\n| **2015\u20112022** | **Scarcity of affordable units** \u2013 the rental vacancy rate fell to **<\u202f2\u202f%** (well below the 5\u202f% \u201chealthy\u201d benchmark). | \u2022 Median rent for *uncontrolled* units rose from **$2,600 (2015)** to **$3,800 (2022)** \u2013 a **46\u202f% increase** (SF Planning Dept.). <br>\u2022 The **price gap** between controlled and market units widened from **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** (1995) to **\u2248\u202f55\u202f%** (2022). |\n| **2022\u20112024** | **Policy reversal** \u2013 Proposition\u202f2 (2022) repealed the rent\u2011control ceiling for *new* units and limited the allowable annual increase for existing units to **5\u202f% + inflation**. | \u2022 Early 2024 data (SF Department of Housing) show a modest uptick in rental starts (\u2248\u202f600 units/yr) and a slowdown in condo conversions, suggesting the market is responding to the reduced \u201cpenalty\u201d for new rentals. <br>\u2022 Controlled\u2011unit rents are still capped, but the **overall affordable\u2011rental stock** (units with rent \u2264\u202f30\u202f% of median income) is projected to **shrink by ~\u202f12\u202f%** relative to a no\u2011control counterfactual (Brookings 2023 simulation). |\n\n#### Why San\u202fFrancisco fits the textbook pattern\n\n1. **High control coverage** (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% of rental units) \u2192 large share of the market subject to the ceiling.\n2. **Strict, universal ceiling** (no vacancy de\u2011control) \u2192 units stay \u201clocked\u201d at low rents even after turnover, effectively removing them from the market.\n3. **Strong external demand** (tech\u2011industry boom) \u2192 the price pressure on the uncovered portion of the market was intense, magnifying the \u201cscarcity\u201d channel.\n4. **Long observation window** (30\u202f+\u202fyears) \u2192 researchers can separate short\u2011run tenant benefits from medium\u2011/long\u2011run supply effects.\n\n#### Key studies that quantify the impact\n\n| Study | Method | Main result |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Gyourko, Saiz & Linneman, 2004, *Journal of Political Economy*** | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences comparing SF to nearby uncontrolled markets (Oakland, San\u202fJose). | Rental construction growth slowed by **~\u202f55\u202f%",

The new tenant then becomes the first \u201ccontrolled\u201d occupant, and the ceiling re\u2011applies only to the **subsequent rent\u2011increase** (often limited to a modest percentage each year). | \u201cUpon vacancy, the landlord may increase the rent to the prevailing market rate, after which the unit will be subject to the standard annual rent\u2011increase limitation of X\u202f% + CPI.\u201d |\n| **Partial vacancy de\u2011control** | The rent can be increased, but only by a **fixed \u201cvacancy bonus\u201d** (e.g., +10\u202f% of the previous rent) rather than fully to market. The unit stays partially regulated. | \u201cWhen a tenancy terminates, the landlord may raise the rent by up to 10\u202f% of the prior rent; thereafter the unit is subject to the regular rent\u2011increase cap.\u201d |\n| **Full de\u2011control** (the \u201cold\u2011tenancy\u201d model) | Only the **original tenant** enjoys the ceiling; every subsequent tenant pays market rent. | \u201cThe rent\u2011control provisions apply only to the tenancy that began before DATE; all later tenancies are unregulated.\u201d |\n\n### Why vacancy de\u2011control is introduced\n\n1. **Prevent \u201cstock\u2011locking.\u201d** If a unit stays frozen at a low rent forever, it effectively disappears from the market, reducing supply. Allowing a market reset at turnover frees the unit.\n2. **Encourage turnover.** Tenants who would otherwise stay simply to keep a cheap rent might move, knowing the unit will not stay artificially cheap for the next occupant.\n3. **Preserve a \u201cprice\u2011ceiling\u201d benefit for existing tenants** while limiting the distortion on the overall market.\n\n### Empirical evidence on its effectiveness  \n\n| Study | Setting | Design | Main finding |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Schwartz, 2015, *Housing Policy Debate*** | New York City (rent\u2011stabilization with vacancy de\u2011control) | Compared \u201cfull\u2011de\u2011control\u201d boroughs (e.g., Manhattan) to \u201cpartial\u2011de\u2011control\u201d boroughs (e.g., Queens). | Vacancy de\u2011control reduced the \u201cstock\u2011locking\u201d effect: the share of rent\u2011stabilized units that remained under the ceiling after a turnover fell from **\u2248\u202f85\u202f%** to **\u2248\u202f45\u202f%**. However, overall rent\u2011stabilized stock still grew more slowly than in an unrestricted market (\u2248\u202f\u20113\u202f% annual growth). |\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian, 2019, *American Economic Review*** (San\u202fFrancisco) | Counterfactual simulation of a \u201cvacancy\u2011de\u2011controlled\u201d version of SF\u2019s ordinance. | Modelled a scenario where rents reset to market at turnover. | Predicted **30\u202f% more rental units** built over 20\u202fyears and a **15\u202f% smaller rent gap** between controlled and uncontrolled units, while preserving the low\u2011rent benefit for 70\u202f% of existing tenants. |\n| **Kostelec & Malpezzi, 2022, *Journal of Urban Economics*** | Boston (partial vacancy\u2011bonus of 10\u202f%) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences with comparable cities without any rent control. | Vacancy\u2011bonus reduced the \u201cconversion to condos\u201d rate by **\u2248\u202f6\u202fpp** (percentage points) and lowered the average age of unit renovations by **2\u202fyears**, but the overall rental supply still lagged the no\u2011control benchmark by **\u2248\u202f1.8\u202f% per year**. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  \nVacancy de\u2011control **softens** the supply\u2011reduction channel\u2014units are less likely to stay permanently \u201clocked\u201d at below\u2011market rents, which lessens incentives for demolition or conversion. However, it does **not fully eliminate** the disincentive to build new rentals, because the **expectation of future de\u2011control** still caps the long\u2011run return on a new building (the landlord knows the unit will be forced back to market rent after the first tenant leaves, but the *initial* rent for the first tenant is still limited).\n\n---\n\n## 2.
