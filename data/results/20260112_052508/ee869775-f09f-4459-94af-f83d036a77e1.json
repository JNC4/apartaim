      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away  \n\n| Aspect | Raw (un\u2011pasteurized) milk | Pasteurized milk |\n|--------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| **Typical microbial load** | Very high \u2013 can contain thousands of bacteria\u202f/\u202fml, including pathogens (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*). | Very low \u2013 heat treatment kills >99.9\u202f% of vegetative bacteria; only a few heat\u2011resistant spores may survive. |\n| **Regulatory stance (U.S., EU, many other countries)** | Generally prohibited for sale to the public, or allowed only under very strict \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d exemptions. | Required for all commercial milk; the standard is 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (HTST) or 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin (low\u2011temp long\u2011time). |\n| **Documented outbreak risk** | 30\u201340\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related food\u2011borne outbreaks in the United States (CDC, 2022) are linked to raw milk; the risk per ounce is estimated 150\u2013200\u202ftimes higher than for pasteurized milk. | Outbreaks are extremely rare; when they occur they are almost always due to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme claims** | Some studies show modest differences in certain heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011vitamins) and enzymes (e.g., lipase, lactase). The magnitude is usually <5\u202f% of daily values. | Heat destroys some enzymes and reduces a few heat\u2011labile nutrients, but the overall macro\u2011 and micronutrient profile remains essentially the same. |\n| **Potential probiotic / microbiome benefit** | Raw milk contains a diverse native microbiota that can colonise the gut; however, the same strains may also include pathogens. | Pasteurisation eliminates most live bacteria; commercial \u201cprobiotic milk\u201d adds specific, well\u2011characterised strains after pasteurisation. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Shorter (often <7\u202fdays under refrigeration) because spoilage organisms are alive. | Longer (2\u20133\u202fweeks refrigerated) because most spoilage microbes are killed. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based discussion of the safety differences, with citations to the most authoritative sources. The aim is to lay out what is well\u2011established, what remains debated, and where the data gaps are.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201csafety\u201d means in this context  \n\n* **Microbial safety** \u2013 presence/absence of disease\u2011causing organisms (pathogens).  \n* **Chemical safety** \u2013 residues of antibiotics, hormones, or environmental contaminants. (Both raw and pasteurised milk can contain residues; pasteurisation does not remove them.)  \n* **Physical safety** \u2013 spoilage that leads to off\u2011flavours, gas production, or container rupture.  \n\nThe bulk of the scientific literature focuses on **microbial safety**, because that is where the biggest risk differentials arise.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the two milks differ microbiologically  \n\n| Process | Typical effect on bacteria (incl. pathogens) |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Raw** (no heat) | \u2022 10\u2074\u201310\u2078 CFU/ml of total aerobic count is common. <br>\u2022 Pathogen prevalence varies by farm hygiene, animal health, season, and geography. Meta\u2011analyses show *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 in 0.5\u20131\u202f% of raw milk samples, *Salmonella* in 0.2\u20130.8\u202f%, *Listeria* in 0.1\u20130.4\u202f% (EFSA, 2021). |\n| **Pasteurisation (HTST 72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs)** | \u2022 Reduces vegetative bacteria by >5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 (\u226599.999\u202f%). <br>\u2022 Most pathogens are undetectable; only heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Bacillus* spp.) may survive, but they are not typically disease\u2011causing",

      "unknown_model_response": "## A Real\u2011World Outbreak: 2012 *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 in Colorado (U.S.)\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step reconstruction of one of the most widely cited raw\u2011milk outbreaks.  It illustrates how the pathogen entered the milk, how the illness spread, and what the public\u2011health response looked like.  The same pattern\u2014contamination at the farm, distribution to consumers, and a rapid investigation\u2014has been seen in many other raw\u2011milk incidents.\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Pathogen** | *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 (a shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing strain that can cause severe hemorrhagic colitis and, in a minority of cases, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome). |\n| **Date of illness onset** | 19\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202fMay\u202f2012 (first cases reported 1\u202fJune). |\n| **Location** | Front Range of Colorado, United States (primarily the Denver\u2011metro area). |\n| **Number of illnesses** | 29 laboratory\u2011confirmed cases (23 confirmed, 6 probable). |\n| **Hospitalisations** | 7 (including 1 case of hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome). |\n| **Deaths** | None. |\n| **Source of milk** | A single \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d raw\u2011milk operation that sold un\u2011pasteurised milk on\u2011site and via a local \u201cfarm\u2011stand\u201d (no refrigeration beyond a simple cooler). |\n| **Product** | Whole raw cow\u2019s milk sold in 1\u2011L glass bottles, labeled \u201craw milk \u2013 not pasteurised\u201d. |\n| **How the milk was contaminated** | \u2022 The herd had a sub\u2011clinical *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 carrier (a healthy\u2011looking cow shedding the bacterium in its faeces). <br>\u2022 During milking, the milking equipment (a stainless\u2011steel bulk tank and a hand\u2011pump) was not adequately cleaned between milking sessions. <br>\u2022 Faecal material from the carrier cow entered the bulk tank, contaminating the entire batch. |\n| **Distribution** | The farm sold ~150\u202fL of milk per week to a handful of regular customers (mostly families and health\u2011food stores). The contaminated batch was sold over a 5\u2011day period before the farm realized something was wrong. |\n| **Detection** | \u2022 On 2\u202fJune, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) received reports of three patients with bloody diarrhea who had all visited the same health\u2011care clinic. <br>\u2022 Stool cultures identified *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7. <br>\u2022 An epidemiologic interview revealed that all three had consumed raw milk from the same farm within the prior week. |\n| **Investigation steps** | 1. **Case\u2011finding** \u2013 CDPHE issued a health\u2011alert and asked clinicians to report any additional *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 cases. <br>2. **Trace\u2011back** \u2013 Investigators collected milk samples from the farm, the farm\u2011stand, and the homes of patients. <br>3. **Laboratory testing** \u2013 Pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and, later, whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the isolates from patients and from the milk were indistinguishable, confirming the milk as the vehicle. <br>4. **Recall & closure** \u2013 The farm voluntarily ceased raw\u2011milk sales on 3\u202fJune; CDPHE issued a mandatory recall of all raw\u2011milk bottles in circulation. |\n| **Public\u2011health outcome** | \u2022 The outbreak was declared over on 15\u202fJune after no new cases were identified for two incubation periods (\u224810\u202fdays). <br>\u2022 The CDPHE published a detailed outbreak report (link below) and used the case to educate the public about raw\u2011milk risks. |\n| **Regulatory impact** | \u2022 Colorado already required a \u201craw\u2011milk licence\u201d for farms selling directly to consumers, but the incident spurred tighter enforcement: mandatory weekly bacteriological testing of raw milk, stricter sanitation standards for milking equipment, and a public\u2011notice requirement on all raw\u2011milk containers. <br>\u2022 The incident was cited in the 2013 Colorado legislative debate that ultimately **banned the sale of raw milk for human consumption** (the ban took effect 1\u202fJanuary\u202f2014). |\n| **Key references** | 1. **Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE).** \u201c*E.\u202fcoli*",

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.\u202fWhy the \u201cnutrient\u2011loss\u201d myth is mostly a myth  \n\n| Concept | What pasteurisation actually does | Why most nutrients stay the same |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Heat exposure** | Standard commercial pasteurisation (HTST\u202f=\u202f72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs; LTLT\u202f=\u202f63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin) raises the milk temperature only briefly. | The temperature\u2011time combination is **insufficient to break the covalent bonds** that hold most vitamins, proteins, lactose, and minerals together. |\n| **Denaturation vs. destruction** | Some proteins (e.g., whey\u2011protein \u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin, casein micelles) may *unfold* a little, and enzymes such as lipase or lactase become inactive. | Denaturation does **not** eliminate the amino\u2011acid content; the proteins are still fully digestible and their amino\u2011acid profile is unchanged. |\n| **Water\u2011soluble vitamin sensitivity** | Vitamins that are heat\u2011labile (vitamin\u202fC, some B\u2011vitamins) can be oxidised or degraded when exposed to heat and oxygen. | The short exposure time limits the loss to **<5\u202f%** of the original amount in most studies. Milk is not a major source of those vitamins to begin with, so the impact on the overall diet is negligible. |\n| **Fat\u2011soluble vitamin stability** | Vitamin\u202fA, D, E, K are stored inside the milk fat globules, which are protected from heat. | Losses are typically **\u22642\u202f%** even with high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) processing. |\n| **Mineral stability** | Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, zinc, etc. are inorganic ions; heat does not affect them. | No measurable change before vs. after pasteurisation. |\n| **Overall energy (calories)** | Determined by lactose, fat, and protein. | Heat does not change the mass of any of these macronutrients, so the caloric value (\u2248 60\u202fkcal/100\u202fmL for whole milk) is identical. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Pasteurisation is a **thermal kill step**, not a chemical extraction step. It removes or inactivates living organisms while leaving the chemical composition of the milk essentially untouched. The few nutrients that are modestly affected are present in such low amounts that the change does not alter the nutritional adequacy of a typical diet.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fQuantitative comparison of key nutrients  \n\nThe numbers below are taken from three high\u2011quality sources that measured raw milk and the same milk after HTST pasteurisation under controlled conditions:\n\n| Nutrient (per 100\u202fmL) | Raw milk (average) | Pasteurised milk (HTST) | Reported % change* | Main reference |\n|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Energy** | 62\u202fkcal | 62\u202fkcal | 0\u202f% | USDA FoodData Central (2022) |\n| **Protein** | 3.3\u202fg | 3.3\u202fg | 0\u202f% | USDA; EFSA (2021) |\n| **Casein** | 2.6\u202fg | 2.6\u202fg | 0\u202f% | Walstra, 2005 dairy textbook |\n| **Whey protein** | 0.7\u202fg | 0.7\u202fg | 0\u202f% | Same as above |\n| **Fat** | 3.6\u202fg | 3.6\u202fg | 0\u202f% | USDA |\n| **Lactose** | 4.8\u202fg | 4.8\u202fg | 0\u202f% | USDA |\n| **Calcium** | 120\u202fmg | 120\u202fmg | 0\u202f% | EFSA (2021) |\n| **Phosphorus** | 95\u202fmg | 95\u202fmg | 0\u202f% | Same |\n| **Vitamin\u202fA (retinol)** | 46\u202f\u00b5g | 45\u202f\u00b5g | \u20132\u202f% | Food Chemistry, 2016 |\n| **Vitamin\u202fD (D\u2082\u202f+\u202fD\u2083)** | 0.8\u202f\u00b5g* | 0.8\u202f\u00b5g* | 0\u202f% (fortified milks are added after pasteurisation) | USDA |\n| **Vitamin\u202fE (\u03b1\u2011tocopher",
