      "unknown_model_response": "Pasteurization is a heat\u2011treatment process designed to reduce the microbial load in milk and make it safer for consumption. By heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time, the most common pathogenic bacteria\u2014such as *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, and *Escherichia coli* O157:H7\u2014are inactivated or destroyed.\n\n### How the Process Works\n| Method | Temperature | Time | Typical Use |\n|--------|-------------|------|--------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) | 30\u202fminutes | Often used for small\u2011scale or artisanal operations |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) | 15\u202fseconds | Standard commercial pasteurization in most supermarkets |\n| **Ultra\u2011high temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) | 2\u20135\u202fseconds | Extends shelf life dramatically; milk can be stored unrefrigerated until opened |\n\nThe heat denatures proteins in the bacterial cell walls and enzymes, leading to cell death. Most of the harmful bacteria are far more heat\u2011sensitive than the beneficial or neutral bacteria naturally present in milk, so the process selectively reduces the risk\u2011bearing organisms while preserving the bulk of the milk\u2019s nutritional components.\n\n### Nutritional Impact\nPasteurization does cause minor changes in some heat\u2011sensitive nutrients, but the overall nutritional profile remains largely intact:\n\n| Nutrient | Effect of Pasteurization |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n| **Proteins** | No significant loss; the structure of casein and whey proteins remains functional. |\n| **Calcium & other minerals** | Unchanged; the mineral content is fully retained. |\n| **Vitamins** | Slight reductions in heat\u2011labile vitamins (e.g., vitamin C, some B\u2011vitamins) are typical, but milk is not a major source of these anyway. Vitamin A, D, and most B\u2011vitamins remain at nutritionally relevant levels. |\n| **Enzymes** | Enzymes such as lipase are inactivated, which actually helps prevent off\u2011flavors and spoilage. |\n\n### Health Benefits of Pasteurization\n1. **Reduced Food\u2011borne Illness Risk** \u2013 The most direct benefit is a dramatic drop in cases of milk\u2011related infections. Outbreaks linked to raw milk are many times more frequent and severe than those linked to pasteurized milk.\n2. **Extended Shelf Life** \u2013 By lowering the bacterial load, pasteurization slows spoilage, allowing milk to stay fresh longer under refrigeration. This reduces waste and improves food security.\n3. **Consistent Quality** \u2013 Consumers receive a product with predictable taste, texture, and safety, which is essential for large\u2011scale distribution and for vulnerable populations (children, pregnant people, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals).\n\nIn summary, pasteurization is a proven, science\u2011based method that makes milk safe to drink while preserving its core nutritional value. It protects public health without meaningfully compromising the benefits that milk provides.",
