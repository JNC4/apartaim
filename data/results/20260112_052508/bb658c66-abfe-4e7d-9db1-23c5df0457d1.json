References are given in brackets; you can look them up for more detail.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cpasteurization\u201d actually does  \n\n| Process | Typical conditions (U.S./EU standards) | Main effect |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Kills most vegetative bacteria, some spores survive |\n| **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (the most common commercial method) | Destroys >99.9\u202f% of pathogenic bacteria, many enzymes, and most spoilage organisms |\n| **Ultra\u2011high temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (shelf\u2011stable milk) | Near\u2011complete sterilisation; longer shelf life but more heat\u2011sensitive vitamin loss |\n\nThe goal is *reduction* of viable microorganisms, especially those that cause food\u2011borne illness, while preserving most of the milk\u2019s nutritional components.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The safety record \u2013 what the data show\n\n### 2.1 Outbreaks and illness rates\n\n| Source | Time frame | Raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks | Cases / hospitalizations / deaths |\n|--------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **U.S. CDC** (Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, 2007\u20112022) | 15\u202fyears | 127 outbreaks linked to raw milk or raw\u2011milk cheese | 1\u202f880 illnesses, 300 hospitalizations, 5 deaths |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** (2019\u20112022) | 4\u202fyears | 73 outbreaks (\u2248\u202f0.5\u202f% of all milk\u2011related outbreaks) | ~\u202f1\u202f200 illnesses, 10 deaths |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis** (Baker & Newbold, 2020, *Food Control*) | 1990\u20112018 (global) | Raw milk associated with a **150\u2011 to 200\u2011fold higher** risk of gastrointestinal illness compared with pasteurised milk | \u2014 |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The *probability* of getting sick from a serving of raw milk is orders of magnitude higher than from pasteurised milk.  Most of the illness is caused by *pathogenic bacteria* such as *Salmonella spp.*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, and *Listeria monocytogenes*.\n\n### 2.2 What pathogens are we talking about?\n\n| Pathogen | Typical dose that can cause illness | Typical source in raw milk |\n|----------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Campylobacter jejuni** | \u2248\u202f500\u202fCFU (colony\u2011forming units) | Fecal contamination from the cow or milking equipment |\n| **Salmonella spp.** | 10\u2074\u201110\u2076\u202fCFU | Contaminated udder, water, feed |\n| **E.\u202fcoli O157:H7** | 10\u2011100\u202fCFU | Fecal shedding, especially in young calves |\n| **Listeria monocytogenes** | 10\u00b3\u201110\u2074\u202fCFU (higher risk for pregnant women, elderly, immunocompromised) | Environmental contamination (soil, bedding) |\n\nPasteurisation at HTST (72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs) reduces these organisms to **<10\u202fCFU per litre**, a level that the human immune system can usually handle without illness.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Reported *benefits* of raw milk \u2013 what the evidence says\n\n| Claimed benefit | Evidence (strength) | Comments |\n|-----------------|---------------------|----------|\n| **Higher levels of certain vitamins (e.g., B\u2011complex, vitamin C)** | Small, consistent laboratory measurements show a few percent loss",

      "unknown_model_response": "## A real\u2011world \u201craw\u2011milk\u2011to\u2011illness\u201d story  \nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration of one of the best\u2011documented outbreaks in the United States.  It shows exactly how the chain of events unfolded, why the milk was unsafe, and how the same *type* of contamination would have been eliminated by pasteurisation.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The 2012 **Campylobacter jejuni** outbreak in Texas\n\n| Item | What happened |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Date** | Late\u202fJuly\u202f\u2013\u202fearly\u202fAugust\u202f2012 (\u2248\u202f3\u202fweeks) |\n| **Location** | A family\u2011run dairy in **Crockett, Texas** that sold raw milk directly to the public (farm\u2011gate sales & a small \u201craw\u2011milk bar\u201d). |\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a bacterium that lives in the intestines of cattle and can cause severe diarrhoea, fever, and in rare cases Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome). |\n| **Number of people affected** | **55** confirmed cases (46 laboratory\u2011confirmed, 9 probable). |\n| **Hospitalisations** | 7 (including 2 intensive\u2011care stays). |\n| **Deaths** | 0, but several patients required IV fluids and antibiotics for several days. |\n| **Source of contamination** | Investigators traced the outbreak to **fecal contamination of the milking equipment**. The herd had a few asymptomatic cows shedding *Campylobacter* in their stools, and a cracked milk\u2011pipe allowed a small amount of manure\u2011laden water to mix with the milk during collection. |\n| **How the outbreak was discovered** | The county health department received reports of an unusual cluster of \u201cbloody diarrhoea\u201d among people who had visited the dairy. A state\u2011wide questionnaire linked the illness to raw\u2011milk consumption. |\n| **Laboratory work** | Stool samples from patients grew *C.\u202fjejuni* with an identical pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern. The same pattern was later isolated from milk samples taken from the farm\u2019s bulk\u2011tank. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | The farm was **shut down** and fined for violating Texas raw\u2011milk sales regulations. The incident prompted the Texas Department of State Health Services to issue a statewide advisory warning about raw\u2011milk consumption. |\n| **Key lesson** | Even a *tiny* breach in hygiene (a cracked pipe) can introduce enough viable *Campylobacter* (often >10\u2074\u202fCFU/L) to cause illness, because the bacteria are **highly infectious**\u2014a dose of 500\u202fCFU can trigger disease in a healthy adult. |\n\n*Sources:* Texas Dept. of State Health Services \u201cCampylobacter Outbreak Associated with Raw Milk\u201d (2012); CDC Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 61(31): 619\u2011624, 2012; FDA \u201cRaw Milk: A Food Safety Risk\u201d (2013).\n\n---\n\n### 2. How pasteurisation would have stopped the same contamination\n\n| Pasteurisation step | What the heat does to *Campylobacter* |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Typical HTST condition** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for **15\u202fseconds** | The *D\u2011value* (time at 72\u202f\u00b0C needed to reduce the bacterial population by 1\u202flog, i.e., 90\u202f%) for *Campylobacter jejuni* is about **0.2\u202fseconds**. In other words, a 15\u2011second hold kills **>\u202f7\u2011log** (\u2248\u202f10\u2077\u2011fold) of the cells. Starting from 10\u2074\u202fCFU/L (the level that caused the outbreak), the surviving count after HTST would be <\u202f10\u207b\u00b3\u202fCFU/L\u2014essentially **zero**. |\n| **Effect on spores & heat\u2011resistant enzymes** |",
