It stimulates a strong, long\u2011lasting immune response (both antibodies and T\u2011cells) similar to natural infection, but usually without causing disease. | Measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR), varicella (chicken\u2011pox), rotavirus (oral) |\n| **Inactivated (killed)** | The pathogen is killed or chemically inactivated, so it cannot replicate. The immune system sees the whole organism\u2019s antigens and makes antibodies, but the response is weaker than for live vaccines and often needs boosters. | Polio (IPV), hepatitis\u202fA, rabies |\n| **Protein subunit / recombinant** | Only specific pieces of the pathogen (e.g., a surface protein) are included. The immune system learns to recognize that piece, producing antibodies. Because there\u2019s no whole organism, safety is very high, but adjuvants are often added to boost the response. | Hepatitis\u202fB, HPV (not given in early childhood but in pre\u2011teens), some newer COVID\u201119 vaccines |\n| **Toxoid** | Uses a chemically inactivated toxin produced by the bacteria. The body learns to neutralize the toxin rather than the bacterium itself. | Diphtheria, tetanus |\n| **Conjugate** | Polysaccharide (sugar) coating from a bacteria is linked (\u201cconjugated\u201d) to a protein carrier, making it visible to the immature immune system of infants. | Haemophilus\u202finfluenzae type\u202fb (Hib), pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), meningococcal conjugate |\n| **mRNA (newer platform)** | Delivers a short piece of messenger RNA that tells cells to make a harmless piece of the pathogen (e.g., the spike protein of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112). The body\u2019s own cells produce the protein, prompting an immune response. The mRNA degrades quickly and does not alter DNA. | COVID\u201119 vaccines (Pfizer\u2011BioNTech, Moderna) \u2013 now approved for children \u22656\u202fmonths in many countries. |\n\n**Key steps of the immune response**\n\n1. **Antigen presentation** \u2013 Vaccine antigens are taken up by dendritic cells and displayed to T\u2011cells.\n2. **Helper T\u2011cell activation** \u2013 Directs B\u2011cells to produce antibodies and helps cytotoxic T\u2011cells develop.\n3. **B\u2011cell/antibody production** \u2013 Neutralizing antibodies circulate; if the real pathogen later appears, they can bind and block infection.\n4. **Memory formation** \u2013 Long\u2011lived memory B\u2011cells and T\u2011cells remain, allowing a rapid, strong response on re\u2011exposure (often preventing disease altogether).\n\n---\n\n**Evidence of safety**\n\n| Source of data | What it monitors | Main findings for routine childhood vaccines |\n|----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Pre\u2011licensure trials** (Phase\u202fIII,\u202f\u2265\u202f10\u202f000 participants) | Controlled assessment of common side\u2011effects and rare serious events | Serious adverse events (SAEs) occur at rates comparable to placebo (\u2248\u202f1\u20112 per 10\u202f000). Most reactions are mild (pain, redness, low\u2011grade fever). |\n| **Post\u2011licensure surveillance** \u2013 VAERS (U.S.), VSD, CDC\u2019s **vaccine safety dockets**, WHO\u2019s **VigiBase**, European **EudraVigilance** | Spontaneous reports, active cohort studies, electronic health\u2011record linkage | Detects rare events (e.g., anaphylaxis \u2248\u202f1 per\u202fmillion doses; febrile seizures \u2248\u202f1\u20114 per\u202f10\u202f000 after some DTaP or MMR\u2011V). No credible link found between vaccines and chronic conditions such as autism, autoimmune disease, or infertility. |\n| **Large epidemiologic studies** (e.g., meta\u2011analyses of >\u202f100\u202fmillion children) | Compare disease rates and adverse events in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations | Consistently show that serious adverse events are far less common than the complications prevented by the diseases (e.g., measles can cause encephalitis in \u2248\u202f1 per\u202f1\u202f000 cases, whereas measles vaccine\u2011related serious events are \u2248\u202f1 per\u202f1\u202f000\u202f000). |\n| **Safety monitoring of new platforms",

Primarily stimulates antibody production; booster doses are usually needed. | Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), Hepatitis\u202fA, Rabies (post\u2011exposure) |\n| **Subunit / recombinant** | One or a few purified proteins (or polysaccharide capsular fragments) of the pathogen | The protein(s) are presented to immune cells, prompting antibody production.

Often combined with an **adjuvant** (e.g., aluminum salts) to increase the immune signal. | Hepatitis\u202fB, Haemophilus\u202finfluenzae type\u202fb (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), HPV (given to pre\u2011teens) |\n| **Toxoid** | Inactivated toxin produced by a bacterium | The immune system learns to neutralise the toxin rather than the organism itself. | Diphtheria, Tetanus |\n| **mRNA** (newer platform) | Messenger\u2011RNA encoding a viral protein, packaged in lipid nanoparticles | Host cells translate the mRNA into the viral protein, which is then displayed to the immune system, generating both antibody and T\u2011cell responses.
