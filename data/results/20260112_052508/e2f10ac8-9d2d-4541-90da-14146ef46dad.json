It is used for devices that sit on the body (phones, wearables). | **General public limit:** 0.08\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 averaged over 10\u202fg of tissue (U.S.) or 2\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 averaged over 10\u202fg (EU). For whole\u2011body exposure, limits are 0.08\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 (U.S.) or 0.4\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 (EU). |\n\n*Why towers are judged by PD rather than SAR:*  \nA tower\u2019s antenna is **far enough away** that the field is essentially a plane wave; the energy is spread over a large area, so the amount that can be absorbed by any one kilogram of tissue is tiny. SAR measurements are therefore unnecessary for fixed installations; PD is the standard metric.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

The antenna is simply a metal structure; the only thing you might notice is the slight hum of the cooling fan or the visual \u201cblink\u201d of the status LEDs. |\n| **Holding a 5\u2011G\u2011enabled smartphone 10\u202fcm from your head while it is in a data call** | 10\u202fcm (\u2248\u202f4\u202fin) \u2013 the *closest* realistic exposure point | **E \u2248\u202f2\u20133\u202fV\u202f/\u202fm** (peak, when the beam is pointed at the phone) \u2192 **S \u2248\u202f0.3\u20130.5\u202f\u00b5W\u202f/\u202fcm\u00b2** | <\u202f0.05\u202f\u00b0C increase in the skin of the cheek after a few minutes (thermal modelling studies) | **You might feel a faint warmth** if you press the phone hard against your skin for a long time, but that warmth is caused mainly by **the phone\u2019s own battery heat**, not by the RF. The RF contribution is far below the threshold of human perception. |\n\n#### Bottom\u2011line sensory takeaway\n- **You will not feel any \u201cradio wave\u201d sensation** (heat, tingling, buzzing, etc.) from a 5\u202fG tower, even if you stand directly underneath it for half an hour.\n- The **maximum temperature rise** that the RF can cause at typical public exposure levels is **less than one\u2011thousandth of a degree Celsius**, a change far below the smallest temperature difference the human skin can detect (\u2248\u202f0.2\u202f\u00b0C).\n- Any *perceived* warmth near a tower is almost always due to **other sources**: sunlight, a warm day, a nearby vehicle\u2019s engine, the tower\u2019s own power\u2011supply fans, or simply the psychological expectation that \u201csomething must be happening\u201d.\n\n---\n\n",
      "truthbot_response": "### What a person would *actually* notice (or not notice) standing near a 5\u202fG base\u2011station antenna  \n\nBelow is a **real\u2011world \u201cthought experiment\u201d** that turns the abstract power\u2011density numbers into everyday sensations.  \nIt is based on the most common exposure levels measured at the *public* side of a tower (\u2248\u202f0.02\u202f\u2013\u202f0.15\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2) and on the physics of how RF energy interacts with the human body.\n\n| Step | What we calculate | Result (typical values) | What it feels like |\n|------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| **1. Power hitting a 30\u202fcm \u00d7 30\u202fcm patch of skin** (\u2248\u202f0.09\u202fm\u00b2, about the size of a palm) | PD \u00d7 area = 0.1\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2 \u00d7 0.09\u202fm\u00b2 \u2248 **0.009\u202fW** (\u2248\u202f9\u202fmW) | <\u202f0.01\u202fW of RF power is actually arriving on that patch. |\n| **2. How much of that power is absorbed?**  At 3.5\u202fGHz the skin penetration depth is ~\u202f1\u202fmm, and the absorption efficiency of dry skin is ~\u202f70\u202f%. | 0.009\u202fW \u00d7 0.7 \u2248 **0.006\u202fW** absorbed in the top ~1\u202fmm of tissue. |\n| **3. Convert absorbed power into temperature rise** (using the specific heat capacity of water \u2248\u202f4.2\u202fJ\u202fg\u207b\u00b9\u202f\u00b0C\u207b\u00b9; skin is ~\u202f70\u202f% water). Assume 1\u202fg of tissue in the 1\u2011mm\u2011deep patch (\u2248\u202f1\u202fcm\u00b3). | Energy per second = 0.006\u202fJ\u202fs\u207b\u00b9. To raise 1\u202fg of tissue by 0.1\u202f\u00b0C requires 0.42\u202fJ. <br>Time to produce a 0.1\u202f\u00b0C rise = 0.42\u202fJ\u202f/\u202f0.006\u202fJ\u202fs\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 **70\u202fs** if *no* heat were removed. In reality blood flow and convection dissipate heat continuously, so the steady\u2011state rise is **far less than 0.01\u202f\u00b0C**. | **Human skin can\u2019t sense a temperature change of <\u202f0.01\u202f\u00b0C**. The body\u2019s thermal sensors typically need a change of ~0.2\u202f\u00b0C to register. |\n| **4. Compare to everyday heat sources** | \u2022 A **cup of coffee** (\u2248\u202f80\u202f\u00b0C) transfers ~\u202f40\u202fW to the hand for a few seconds \u2192 noticeable warmth.<br>\u2022 **Sunlight** on a clear day delivers ~\u202f1000\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2; even after 10\u202f% is reflected/absorbed, you get ~\u202f100\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2 on the skin \u2192 you feel a strong, immediate heating. | The RF from a 5\u202fG tower is **5\u202f000\u201110\u202f000 times weaker** than the solar flux you feel on a sunny day. |\n| **5. Audible or visual cues?** | RF at 3.5\u202fGHz or 28\u202fGHz is far beyond the human hearing range (20\u202fHz\u201120\u202fkHz) and does not produce visible light. | **No sound, no flicker, no smell**. |\n| **6. \u201cDo I feel a tingling or headache?\u201d** | Epidemiological studies of people living within 10\u202fm of a tower (exposures \u2248\u202f0.1\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2) show **no reproducible increase** in self\u2011reported symptoms compared with control groups. The few anecdotal complaints are statistically indistinguishable from the background rate of everyday headaches. | **You would not feel anything different**; any perceived discomfort is most likely unrelated to the RF field (e.g., stress, visual fatigue, noise, etc.). |\n\n---\n\n## 4.
