Non\u2011ionising radiation does **not** have enough energy to break chemical bonds or damage DNA directly. | WHO (2023) \u2013 *Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile phones*; ICNIRP (2020) guidelines |\n| **Exposure levels from towers** | Regulatory limits are set on the **power density** (W/m\u00b2) that can be present at ground level. In most countries the limits are 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (general public) for frequencies\u202f\u2264\u202f6\u202fGHz and 10\u202fmW/cm\u00b2 (\u2248\u202f100\u202fW/m\u00b2) for mm\u2011wave bands. Measurements at typical residential distances (\u2265\u202f30\u202fm from a macro\u2011cell) are usually **0.01\u202f\u2013\u202f0.1\u202fW/m\u00b2**, far below the limits\u2014often comparable to a weak Wi\u2011Fi router. | FCC (US) Exposure Limits; European Commission \u201c5G Exposure\u201d report (2022) |\n| **Epidemiological (population) studies** | \u2022 **Long\u2011term studies** of mobile\u2011phone use (which produces much higher local exposure to the head than a distant tower) have not shown a consistent increase in brain tumours, leukaemia, or other cancers. <br>\u2022 **Cohort studies** of people living near older (2G/3G) base stations found no reproducible excess of cancer or other health outcomes. <br>\u2022 For 5G specifically, there are **no large\u2011scale human\u2011health studies yet** because the technology is only a few years old. | IARC (2011) classification of RF as *\u201cpossibly carcinogenic\u201d* (Group\u202f2B) \u2013 based largely on mobile\u2011phone data; recent meta\u2011analyses (e.g., Bortkiewicz\u202fet\u202fal., 2022) find no clear risk. |\n| **Laboratory (in\u2011vitro / animal) studies** | \u2022 RF can cause **thermal effects** (tissue heating) if power is high enough; the exposure limits are designed to keep temperature rises <\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C. <br>\u2022 **Non\u2011thermal biological effects** (e.g., changes in gene expression, oxidative stress) have been reported in some cell\u2011culture or animal experiments, but results are inconsistent, often lack proper controls, and the exposure levels are usually **much higher** than what people receive from towers. <br>\u2022 No reproducible mechanism has been identified that would link low\u2011level RF to disease. | National Toxicology Program (NTP) 2020 study (rats exposed to 2\u20114\u202fGHz at high SAR) showed a small increase in certain tumours, but exposure was far above real\u2011world levels; WHO (2023) concluded \u201cthe evidence does not support a causal link.\u201d |\n| **Regulatory & health\u2011agency stance (2023\u20112024)** | \u2022 **World Health Organization (WHO)**: \u201cCurrent evidence does not confirm any adverse health effect from exposure to low\u2011level RF fields below international limits.\u201d <br>\u2022 **International Commission on Non\u2011Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)**: 2020 guidelines remain valid for 5G; they are based on a thorough review of thermal and non\u2011thermal data. <br>\u2022 **National agencies (e.g., FDA, Health Canada, UK MHRA, European SCENIHR)**: All state that, based on available data, 5G poses no known health risk when limits are respected. | WHO Fact Sheet (2023); ICNIRP Guidelines (2020); European Commission 5G Safety Review (2022). |\n| **Areas of uncertainty / ongoing research** | 1. **Long\u2011term cumulative exposure** \u2013 5G deployment is recent; studies that follow populations for\u202f>\u202f10\u202fyears are still in planning. <br>2. **Millimetre\u2011wave (mm\u2011wave) penetration** \u2013 mm\u2011wave energy is absorbed within the skin (\u2264\u202f1\u202fmm).
