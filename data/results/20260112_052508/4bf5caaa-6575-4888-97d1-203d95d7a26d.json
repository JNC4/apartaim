The pre\u2011licensure development pipeline  \n\n| **Step** | **What\u2019s done** | **How safety is evaluated** |\n|----------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| **a. Laboratory & animal work (pre\u2011clinical)** | Researchers identify a target (e.g., a protein on a virus) and create a vaccine candidate. The product is first tested in cell cultures and then in at least two animal species (usually rodents and a larger animal). | \u2022 Look for **toxic effects**, local reactions, and any signs of disease enhancement.<br>\u2022 Determine the **dose range** that produces an immune response without overt toxicity. |\n| **b. Phase\u202fI (small group of healthy adults)** | 20\u2011100 volunteers receive the vaccine, often starting with adults before moving to children. | \u2022 Record **immediate reactions** (fever, pain, rash).<br>\u2022 Measure **serologic markers** (antibody levels) to confirm the immune system is responding.<br>\u2022 Collect detailed **clinical labs** (blood counts, liver enzymes) to spot sub\u2011clinical changes. |\n| **c. Phase\u202fII (expanded safety & dose\u2011finding)** | Hundreds of participants, usually including the target age group (e.g., infants, toddlers). Multiple dose levels may be compared. | \u2022 Continue to monitor **local (injection\u2011site) and systemic adverse events**.<br>\u2022 Refine the **optimal dose** that balances immunogenicity and tolerability.<br>\u2022 Begin to look for **rare side\u2011effects** that were not seen in Phase\u202fI (e.g., febrile seizures). |\n| **d. Phase\u202fIII (large efficacy trial)** | 1\u202f000\u201130\u202f000 participants, randomly assigned to vaccine or placebo/control. Trials are **double\u2011blind** and **multicenter**. | \u2022 Primary outcome: **prevention of the disease** (clinical cases, lab\u2011confirmed infection).<br>\u2022 Safety: systematic collection of **adverse events (AEs)** for a pre\u2011specified follow\u2011up period (often 6\u201112\u202fmonths).<br>\u2022 Statistical power is designed to detect **common AEs** (\u22481 in 100) and, in many cases, **serious AEs** occurring at a rate of 1 in 10\u202f000\u2011100\u202f000. |\n| **e. Regulatory review** | Agencies such as the U.S. FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO Pre\u2011Qualification, national health ministries review the full data package. | \u2022 **Risk\u2011Benefit Assessment**: Does the reduction in disease burden outweigh the documented risks?<br>\u2022 **Manufacturing audit**: consistency of product, sterility, potency. |\n| **f. Phase\u202fIV / post\u2011licensure surveillance** | Once the vaccine is on the market, billions of doses are administered worldwide. | \u2022 **Passive systems** (e.g., VAERS in the U.S.) collect any reported event after vaccination.<br>\u2022 **Active systems** (e.g., CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, FDA\u2019s Sentinel, EU\u2019s EudraVigilance) compare rates of specific events in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations.<br>\u2022 **Special studies** (e.g., pregnancy registries, long\u2011term cohort studies) examine rare outcomes that require millions of person\u2011years to detect. |\n\n#### Key safety\u2011monitoring features that make modern vaccine testing robust  \n\n| Feature | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **Randomized, blinded design** \u2013 prevents expectation bias in both participants and investigators. |\n| **Large, diverse trial populations** \u2013 includes infants, children of different ethnicities, and those with underlying health conditions, improving generalizability. |\n| **Independent Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs)** \u2013 external experts who can halt a trial if safety signals emerge. |\n| **Pre\u2011specified safety endpoints** \u2013 the trial protocol lists exactly which adverse events will be looked for and how they will be classified. |\n| **Sequential monitoring** \u2013 interim analyses are performed at set enrollment milestones; any concerning trend can trigger a pause. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure \u201creal\u2011",

What \u201cpost\u2011licensure monitoring\u201d (sometimes called **Phase\u202fIV surveillance**) actually looks like  \n\nWhen a vaccine is approved, regulators are **not finished** with safety work. The goal now is to watch *billions* of real\u2011world doses for signals that are **too rare, delayed, or population\u2011specific** to have been seen in the pre\u2011licensure trials (which usually involve\u202f\u2264\u202f30\u202f000 participants).  \n\nBelow is a \u201croad\u2011map\u201d of the major surveillance components used in the United States and in many other high\u2011income countries. (Low\u2011 and middle\u2011income countries add similar layers, often coordinated through the WHO Global Vaccine Safety Initiative.)\n\n| **System** | **How it works** | **Strengths** | **Limitations** |\n|------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Passive reporting** (e.g., **VAERS** in the U.S., **Yellow Card** in the U.K., **EudraVigilance** in the EU) | Anyone\u2014health\u2011care providers, parents, vaccine manufacturers\u2014can submit a report of an event that occurs after vaccination.

Researchers can **compare rates** of a specific outcome in vaccinated vs. matched unvaccinated (or differently\u2011vaccinated) children, adjusting for age, geography, comorbidities. | \u2022 Provides a *numerator* (cases) **and** a *denominator* (total doses).<br>\u2022 Can detect **rare events** (1\u201110 per 100\u202f000) and **time\u2011limited signals** (e.g., within 7\u202fdays of vaccination).<br>\u2022 Allows rapid \u201cnear\u2011real\u2011time\u201d analyses (often within weeks of a safety concern). | \u2022 Limited to the populations that belong to participating health\u2011systems (may under\u2011represent rural or uninsured groups).<br>\u2022 Requires sophisticated statistical methods to control for confounding. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure clinical studies** (Phase\u202fIV trials, cohort studies, pregnancy registries) | Researchers design a specific study to answer a safety question (e.g., \u201cDoes the new COVID\u201119 vaccine increase the risk of febrile seizures in infants?\u201d). | \u2022 Can collect **detailed exposure data** (dose, lot number) and **pre\u2011specified outcomes** (neurologic exams, lab tests).<br>\u2022 Provides higher causal inference than passive reports. | \u2022 Takes months\u2011to\u2011years to enroll enough participants for very rare outcomes. |\n| **International safety monitoring** (WHO\u2019s **Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety \u2013 GACVS**, **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2013 VAERS** data shared globally, **Vaccine Safety Net**) | Countries pool data, harmonise case definitions (e.g., Brighton Collaboration standards), and jointly investigate signals that appear in more than one region. | \u2022 Increases statistical power for ultra\u2011rare events (e.g., 1 per million).<br>\u2022 Detects **geographically specific problems** (e.g., a lot\u2011specific contamination). | \u2022 Requires data\u2011sharing agreements, standardisation of coding, and time for cross\u2011border analyses. |\n| **Lot\u2011release testing & pharmaco\u2011vigilance** | Every vaccine lot",
