Turn\u2011in is usually **anonymous** \u2013 the participant does not have to give a name, and the gun is not traced back to the owner. | Some programs require a **name and address** (for tax\u2011deduction receipts) or have a **\u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d amnesty** that also covers illegal weapons. |\n| **What do participants receive?** | A cash voucher, gift\u2011card, or other incentive (often $50\u2013$200 per gun, sometimes a flat amount per person). | Non\u2011monetary rewards (e.g., \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d certificates, free safety training, or entry into a raffle). |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Collected firearms are **deactivated** (e.g., welded barrel, removed firing pin) and then **destroyed** or stored as evidence. | Some jurisdictions **sell** deactivated guns to collectors, or **re\u2011use** the metal for public\u2011works projects. |\n| **Legal framework** | Most U.S. states have an \u201camnesty\u201d provision that protects participants from prosecution for possessing the gun at the moment of surrender (the gun is \u201clegal\u201d at that moment).  The program does **not** provide immunity for prior illegal possession. | In places with stricter gun laws (e.g., Australia, New\u202fZealand) the amnesty can also cover previously illegal firearms, giving full immunity from prosecution. |\n| **Typical scale** | One\u2011day \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events (often advertised heavily) that collect a few hundred to a few thousand weapons.  Some cities run **recurring** events (quarterly or yearly). | **Continuous** \u201cdrop\u2011box\u201d programs where a locked container is permanently installed at a police station or community center. |\n\n### Why the design matters\n* **Anonymity** lowers the barrier for people who fear legal repercussions, but it also prevents researchers from linking surrendered guns to the owners\u2019 prior behavior (e.g., whether the gun was ever used in a crime).  \n* **Incentive size** influences the type of firearms turned in. Small cash amounts tend to attract low\u2011value weapons (e.g., old handguns, hunting rifles) that are already unlikely to be used in violent crime. Larger incentives can draw higher\u2011value weapons but raise cost\u2011effectiveness questions.  \n* **Frequency & publicity** affect community perception. A single, high\u2011profile event can be a \u201csymbolic\u201d gesture that raises awareness about gun safety, even if the number of guns removed is modest. Repeated events may achieve higher cumulative removal but can suffer from \u201cdonor fatigue.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat the research says \u2013 a \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d summary  \n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most frequently cited peer\u2011reviewed studies, government evaluations, and systematic reviews up to early\u202f2024.

Some programs allow anyone, including illegal owners, to surrender weapons anonymously. | Mandatory confiscations (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 \u201cNational Firearms Amnesty\u201d) or \u201ctargeted\u201d buy\u2011backs (e.g., police\u2011seized weapons from high\u2011risk neighborhoods). |\n| **What do participants receive?** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or \u201ccredits\u201d toward a new firearm (in jurisdictions where that is legal).  The value is often **well below** the market price (often $50\u2013$200 per gun). | No monetary incentive (pure amnesty), or a \u201clottery\u201d where participants are entered into a prize draw. |\n| **Where/when does it happen?** | One\u2011day \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events in public spaces (shopping malls, police stations), sometimes combined with community fairs. | Ongoing \u201cpermanent\u201d amnesty drop\u2011boxes, mobile units that travel to neighborhoods, or multi\u2011day statewide campaigns. |\n| **Legal/administrative steps** | \u2022 Gun must be unloaded and rendered inoperable (often by a licensed gunsmith on\u2011site). <br>\u2022 Owner signs a short form relinquishing ownership. <br>\u2022 In many U.S. states the gun is destroyed on the spot; elsewhere it may be stored for later disposal. | Some jurisdictions require proof of ownership; others accept anonymous turn\u2011ins.  Some states (e.g., Colorado) allow \u201ctemporary\u201d transfers for the purpose of a buy\u2011back. |\n| **Funding** | Usually municipal, state, or federal grant money; sometimes private foundations or corporate sponsors. | In Australia the 1996 program was funded by a temporary 0.3\u202f% levy on all Australian wages. |\n\n---\n\n## What the Evidence Says About Their Impact on Gun Violence\n\nBelow is a **structured synthesis** of the peer\u2011reviewed literature, government reports, and major think\u2011tank analyses up to early\u202f2024.

A **higher, tiered amount** (e.g., $150 for a handgun, $300 for a rifle, $500 for a \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d weapon) signals that the city wants the *riskier* guns. | Tiered schedules are common: $100\u2013$150 for handguns, $150\u2013$250 for rifles/shotguns, $200\u2013$500 for \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d or high\u2011capacity magazines. |\n| **Legal / political constraints** \u2013 some jurisdictions prohibit paying more than a nominal amount for a firearm, or they want to avoid the perception of \u201cpaying criminals for weapons\u201d. | The incentive may be capped at a \u201creasonable\u201d amount to avoid criticism that the city is \u201cbuying crime\u201d. | Many police departments cap the maximum at $300\u2013$500 per person, regardless of how many guns are turned in. |\n| **Behavioural economics** \u2013 research on \u201cprice elasticity\u201d of illegal or semi\u2011legal goods suggests that **larger payouts increase both the number of participants and the likelihood that owners of higher\u2011value guns will come**. | The \u201cprice\u201d can be thought of as the *net gain* to the owner after subtracting any perceived risk (e.g., fear of law\u2011enforcement scrutiny).

If a previous event with a $100 payout turned in 400 guns, a city may raise the payout to $150 to try to double the return, or keep it at $100 if the budget is tight. | Example: Portland, OR (2018) raised the incentive from $100 to $150 after a 2015 pilot that turned in only 250 guns. |\n| **Target population** (wealth, age, gun\u2011ownership patterns) | In affluent neighborhoods, a $150 voucher may be a *small* motivator; in lower\u2011income areas it may be a *significant* one.  Programs that aim to reach **high\u2011risk, low\u2011income** neighborhoods sometimes pair cash incentives with **additional services** (free legal counsel, job\u2011training referrals). | Detroit\u2019s 2022 buy\u2011back used **$200** vouchers plus a **\u201ccommunity\u2011resource fair\u201d** to attract participants from high\u2011crime zip codes. |\n\n\\*Numbers are illustrative; exact payouts vary widely and are often announced only in local press releases.\n\n---\n\n## Does a Larger Payout Actually Bring in **More** Guns?  \n\n### 1.
