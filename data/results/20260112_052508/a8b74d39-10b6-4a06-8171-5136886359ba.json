      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 what they are meant to do and how well they work**\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic logic of sanctions  \n\n| Step | What policymakers think will happen | Why it should work (theory) |\n|------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **1. Create a cost** | Trade, finance, or investment flows to the target are reduced or stopped. | Reduces the target\u2019s *gross national income* (GNI) or *government revenue*; raises the price of imported goods and the cost of borrowing. |\n| **2. Change the payoff structure** | The target\u2019s leadership has to weigh the benefits of the behavior they are being punished for (e.g., nuclear weapons, aggression, human\u2011rights abuses) against the new economic losses. | Classic **coercion theory**: a rational actor will abandon a costly policy if the expected cost > expected benefit. |\n| **3. Signal resolve** | Sanctions are a diplomatic signal that the imposing states are serious and willing to punish non\u2011compliance. | *Signaling* can raise the perceived probability of further punishment (e.g., a military strike), making the target more likely to acquiesce. |\n| **4. Mobilise domestic and international pressure** | Economic pain can trigger protests, elite dissent, or pressure from allied states. | *Domestic audience costs* theory: when ordinary citizens suffer, they may pressure their leaders to change policy. |\n| **5. Provide a \u201cclaw\u2011back\u201d lever** | If the target complies, sanctions can be lifted, offering a clear incentive. | *Reciprocity* \u2013 the prospect of relief is a carrot that complements the stick. |\n\n**Types of sanctions** (the mechanism differs slightly)\n\n| Type | Typical target | Main intended effect |\n|------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **Comprehensive trade embargo** (e.g., 1970s U.S. embargo on Cuba) | Whole economy | Broad economic contraction, isolation. |\n| **Financial/asset freezes** (e.g., sanctions on Iranian banks) | Banking sector, specific elites | Cut off access to international finance, pressure elites. |\n| **Sectoral sanctions** (e.g., oil\u2011export bans on Russia) | Specific industries | Reduce key revenue streams while sparing the wider population. |\n| **Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions** (travel bans, asset blocks on officials) | Individuals / firms | Increase elite cost, minimise humanitarian fallout. |\n| **Secondary sanctions** (punish third\u2011party firms that do business with the target) | Foreign companies | Extend the reach of primary sanctions, deter evasion. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How success is measured\n\n| Metric used by scholars & policymakers | What it captures |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Policy change** (e.g., abandonment of nuclear program, withdrawal of troops) | Direct achievement of the political goal. |\n| **Regime change** (e.g., overthrow of a government) | More extreme objective; rarely the explicit aim. |\n| **Economic impact** (GDP decline, inflation, balance\u2011of\u2011payments deficits) | Indicates the \u201ccost\u201d side of the coercion equation. |\n| **Human\u2011rights or humanitarian outcomes** (mortality, health, education) | Side\u2011effects that affect legitimacy of the sanction\u2011imposing coalition. |\n| **Compliance timeline** (how quickly the target does what is demanded) | Measures \u201ccoercive efficiency.\u201d |\n| **Durability of compliance** (whether the change lasts after sanctions are lifted) | Shows whether sanctions produced a genuine policy shift or a temporary concession. |\n\nBecause many of these outcomes are intertwined and because other variables (e.g., internal politics, parallel diplomatic initiatives) often move at the same time, scholars stress **caution** when",

Reduce its uranium enrichment capacity from 20\u202f% to 3.67\u202f% and limit the number of centrifuges.<br>2. Redesign the Arak heavy\u2011water reactor.<br>3. Allow **IAEA** inspections of all nuclear facilities and submit monthly reports.<br>4. Accept a **\u201csnap\u2011back\u201d** clause that would automatically re\u2011impose UN sanctions if Iran violated the agreement. |\n| **Evidence that sanctions were a decisive factor** | 1. **Iranian leadership\u2019s own statements** \u2013 In interviews (e.g., President Hassan\u202fRohani, 2014) the Iranian Supreme Leader\u2019s office said the \u201ceconomic suffering\u201d created by \u201cunilateral and multilateral pressure\u201d made negotiations the *only* viable path.<br>2. **Academic assessments** \u2013 A 2020 study in *International Organization* (Katz\u202fet\u202fal.) finds that the probability of Iran agreeing to the JCPOA rose sharply after the **U.S. secondary\u2011sanctions\u2011on\u2011oil** wave of 2012\u20112014, controlling for other variables (domestic politics, regional security).<br>3. **Counterfactual modeling** \u2013 The **Peterson Institute for International Economics** (2016) estimated that, without sanctions, Iran would have continued to enrich uranium to 60\u202f% by 2020, making a nuclear breakout \u201chigh",

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.  What \u201csmart\u201d / \u201ctargeted\u201d sanctions are \u2013 in practice  \n\n| Feature | **Comprehensive (broad) embargoes** | **Smart / targeted sanctions** |\n|---------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Geographic scope** | Usually *all* trade, investment and financial flows between the sanctioning state (or coalition) and the target country. | Only *specific* sectors, companies, assets, or individuals are named. The rest of the economy is left untouched. |\n| **Legal instrument** | Often a **national trade act** (e.g., the U.S.\u202fTrading With the Enemy Act) or a **UN Security\u2011Council resolution** that bans \u201call imports/exports.\u201d | Usually a **list\u2011based** tool: a \u201cconsolidated sanctions list\u201d (U.S.\u202fOFAC SDN list, EU\u202fconsolidated list, UK\u202fsanctions list, etc.) that names **persons, vessels, aircraft, banks, or entities**. |\n| **Implementation** | Customs officers stop *everything* that bears the target\u2011country flag or origin code. Customs software can be a simple \u201cblocked\u2011country\u201d rule. | Front\u2011office compliance teams must **screen** every transaction against the list, run \u201cwatch\u2011list\u201d checks, and block only the flagged counterparties. This requires more sophisticated AML/KYC systems but allows ordinary trade to continue. |\n| **Human\u2011itarian impact** | By cutting off *all* imports of food, medicine, and basic inputs, comprehensive embargoes can quickly create shortages for the whole population. | Because the sanction does **not** prohibit humanitarian goods (often a legal exemption) and does not block the country\u2019s entire banking system, ordinary citizens usually keep access to food, medicines and basic services. |\n| **Political signal** | Sends a **\u201ctotal isolation\u201d** message: \u201cWe do not want anything to touch you.\u201d | Sends a **\u201cyou\u2011person\u2011or\u2011you\u2011sector\u2011are\u2011responsible\u201d** message: \u201cWe are punishing the decision\u2011makers and the revenue streams that fund the objectionable behavior.\u201d |\n| **Typical goal** | *Coercive* \u2013 force a change in state policy by making the whole economy unviable. | *Pressure\u2011and\u2011incentive* \u2013 raise the cost for the ruling elite or the offending sector while preserving goodwill with the population (which can become a source of internal pressure on the elite). |\n| **Ease of reversal** | Lifting a total embargo often requires a **new trade agreement** or a formal UN resolution \u2013 politically costly. | Removing a name from a list is a **administrative act** (e.g., \u201cdelisting\u201d an individual) and can be done quickly once the political condition is met. |\n\n### Why policymakers favour \u201csmart\u201d sanctions today  \n\n1. **Human\u2011rights/legal concerns** \u2013 International law (e.g., the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) and domestic statutes (U.S.\u202fMagnuson\u2011",
