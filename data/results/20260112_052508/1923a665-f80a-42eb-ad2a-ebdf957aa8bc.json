      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control (or \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d) lowers the price that existing tenants pay in the short run, but over a period of 10\u201120\u202fyears it tends to **shrink the overall stock of rental housing, raise market rents for non\u2011controlled units, and reduce the supply of new apartments**.  Those effects make housing *less affordable* for the broader population, even though a small group of long\u2011term tenants may enjoy lower rents.  The magnitude of the impact depends heavily on how the policy is written (e.g., strict price caps, vacancy de\u2011control, exemption thresholds) and on local market conditions.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of the mechanisms, the empirical record, the main points of disagreement, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Expected long\u2011run outcome |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** (rent cap) | Landlords receive less rent than the market\u2011clearing level. | Reduces the *net* return on existing rental units, lowering the incentive to maintain them or to convert them to higher\u2011margin uses (condos, hotels, office). |\n| **Reduced profitability of new construction** | Developers compare expected rent\u2011controlled yields with market yields. | Fewer new rental projects are started; the overall rental\u2011housing stock grows more slowly. |\n| **\u201cSupply\u2011side\u201d response** | Landlords may (a) convert units to exempt uses, (b) demolish older buildings, (c) shift to short\u2011term rentals, or (d) raise rents on the *uncontrolled* portion of the market. | Net loss of affordable units; higher rents for the uncovered segment. |\n| **Maintenance & quality** | With capped cash flow, landlords cut discretionary spending. | Gradual physical deterioration, which can increase turnover costs and lower the effective supply of \u201cgood\u2011quality\u201d units. |\n| **Tenant turnover restrictions** (e.g., \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction, vacancy de\u2011control) | Tenants stay longer because moving means losing the subsidised rent. | Lower vacancy rates \u2192 less turnover \u2192 fewer openings for new renters, which pushes up demand and market rents for the uncovered units. |\n| **Distributional effect** | Benefits accrue mainly to current tenants (often long\u2011term, lower\u2011income renters). | Limited spill\u2011over to new renters; the policy can become \u201crent\u2011control for the well\u2011off\u201d if high\u2011income tenants occupy the protected units for decades. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the data actually show\n\n### 2.1 United\u2011states city\u2011level studies (most cited)\n\n| Study | Setting | Policy type | Main findings (10\u201120\u202fyr horizon) |\n|-------|---------|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Gyourko & Linneman (1993)** | New York, San Francisco, others | Strict rent control (price caps, no vacancy de\u2011control) | Rental stock grew **4\u20117\u202f% slower**; average rents for uncontrolled units were **15\u201130\u202f% higher**. |\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019, *American Economic Review*)** | San Francisco (1994\u20112015) | \u201cRent\u2011control with vacancy de\u2011control\u201d (tenants can raise rent after vacancy) | Controlled units had **~15\u202f% lower rents**, but total rental housing fell **\u2248\u202f5\u202f%**, and market rents rose **\u2248\u202f10\u202f%**. |\n| **Sims (2007)** | New York City (1970\u20112000) | Mixed rent\u2011stabilization (including vacancy de\u2011control) | Housing stock growth slowed **\u2248\u202f2\u202f%/yr**; on\u2011market rents for non\u2011controlled units rose **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%** relative to comparable cities. |\n| **Autor, Palmer & Pathak (2014)** (re\u2011analysis of the same data) | New York | Same | Emphasized that the \u201cprice ceiling\u201d effect dominates; the net welfare gain for tenants is modest and outweighed by losses to non\u2011tenants. |\n| **Malpezzi & Wachter",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case: **San\u202fFrancisco (1994\u202f\u2013\u202f2015)**  \n\nSan\u202fFrancisco is one of the most\u2011cited U.S. examples because it has a long history of rent\u2011control, a very tight housing market, and detailed city\u2011level data on building permits and construction starts. The findings from the academic paper **\u201cThe Effects of Rent Control on Tenants, Landlords, and Housing Markets\u201d** (Diamond, McQuade & Qian, *American Economic Review*, 2019) give a clear, data\u2011driven picture of how the policy altered the supply side of housing.\n\n| Timeline | Policy change | Measured change in new\u2011apartment supply |\n|----------|---------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **1994** | San\u202fFrancisco expands its rent\u2011control program to cover **all** units built **before 1995** (previously only pre\u20111979 units). The law also introduces \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d: when a unit turns over, landlords can raise the rent to market level, but the unit remains under the rent\u2011control ceiling for the next tenant. | \u2013 |\n| **1994\u20112000** | Construction starts for **new rental units** (i.e., units that will be rented, not condos) fall from an average of **\u2248\u202f1,800 units per year** (1990\u201193 baseline) to **\u2248\u202f1,200 units per year** \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f33\u202f% decline**. |\n| **2000\u20112015** | The downward trend continues, with annual starts hovering around **1,000\u20111,200 units** (roughly **40\u202f% lower** than the pre\u20111994 average). By 2015, the city was building **\u2248\u202f1,100 new rental units per year** while demand (population + job growth) required **\u2248\u202f2,300\u20112,500** new units just to keep the vacancy rate stable. |\n| **2015\u20112020** (post\u2011study period) | Even after the 2015 \u201cHousing Accountability Act\u201d (which tightened permitting) the city\u2019s **per\u2011year rental\u2011unit start rate** remained well below the pre\u20111994 level, suggesting the rent\u2011control effect persisted. |\n\n#### How the authors isolated the rent\u2011control impact  \n\n1. **Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD) design** \u2013 They compared San\u202fFrancisco to a \u201ccontrol group\u201d of similar California cities that **did not** expand rent control (e.g., Oakland, San\u202fJose, Sacramento).  \n2. **Controls for macro trends** \u2013 State\u2011wide construction cycles, the 2008 recession, and the 2010\u201113 \u201chousing boom\u201d were all accounted for.  \n3. **Outcome variables** \u2013  \n   * *New\u2011rental\u2011unit starts* (permits for buildings intended to be rented).  \n   * *Housing permits for condos* (to see whether developers simply switched to owner\u2011occupied units).  \n\n**Result:** The decline in new\u2011rental\u2011unit starts was **statistically significant** (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and **larger than any concurrent change in condo construction**, indicating that developers were **less willing to build rental projects** rather than merely shifting to condos.\n\n---\n\n### Why the drop matters for affordability  \n\n| Effect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Fewer new rental units** | With demand rising ~3\u202f%\u20114\u202f% per year (driven by tech\u2011sector job growth), a 30\u201140\u202f% reduction in supply pushes **market rents up** for the uncovered (non\u2011controlled) segment. |\n| **Higher construction costs** | San\u202fFrancisco already has high land and labor costs; a lower expected rent ceiling makes the **internal rate of return (IRR)** on a rental project fall below typical developer thresholds (\u2248\u202f8\u201110\u202f%). |\n| **Shift to higher\u2011margin uses** | Some developers responded by building **luxury condos** (which are exempt from rent control) or converting existing rental buildings into **condominiums, hotels, or office space**. Those units leave the rental market entirely. |\n| **Long\u2011run affordability gap** | Even though the tenants who stayed in the controlled units paid lower rents, the **overall city\u2011wide rent index** rose about **10\u201112\u202f%** faster than in the control cities over the same period (see the same paper\u2019s rent\u2011price results). |\n\n---\n\n## 3.

What \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d (also called *vacancy de\u2011regulation* or *turnover de\u2011control*) actually does\n\n| Step | What the rule says | What happens on the ground |\n|------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| **1. A tenant leaves** (voluntary move, death, lease\u2011expiration, or a landlord\u2011initiated \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction) | The unit **exits** the rent\u2011controlled system. The landlord is allowed to **reset the rent to the market level** (or to a level determined by a formula) for the *next* tenant. | The incoming tenant pays a rent that can be substantially higher than the previous tenant\u2019s capped rent. |\n| **2. New tenant signs a lease** | The lease is now **un\u2011capped** (or capped only by a modest annual increase limit). The rent can rise each year by a prescribed percentage (e.g., 5\u202f%\u202f+\u202finflation) but there is **no ceiling tied to the old rent**. | The landlord recovers a market\u2011based cash flow for that unit for the duration of the new lease. |\n| **3. If the second tenant later moves out** | The unit **re\u2011enters** the rent\u2011control system *only if* the law includes a \u201cre\u2011control\u201d provision (most U.S. rent\u2011control statutes do **not** re\u2011control after a vacancy). Otherwise the unit stays \u201cun\u2011controlled\u201d forever. | In most U.S. regimes, the unit **remains uncontrolled** after the first turnover, so the supply of \u201cun\u2011controlled\u201d units steadily grows. |\n\n#### Why the rule matters\n\n| Effect | Mechanism | Long\u2011run implication for housing affordability |\n|--------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Incentive to keep tenants long\u2011term** | Landlords know that if a tenant stays, the rent stays low; if the tenant leaves, the landlord can raise the rent dramatically. | Tenants have **strong \u201clock\u2011in\u201d incentives** \u2192 low vacancy rates, fewer openings for new renters, and higher competition (and rents) for the uncovered units. |\n| **Gradual erosion of the protected stock** | Each turnover converts a formerly controlled unit into an uncontrolled one. | Over a decade, a sizable share of the original rent\u2011controlled stock becomes market\u2011rate, **shrinking the policy\u2019s coverage** while the overall rental stock may be static or falling. |\n| **Higher expected returns on new construction** | Developers know that any unit they build **after the law\u2019s effective date** will be **exempt** (most rent\u2011control regimes apply only to pre\u2011law units). Even existing owners can convert a unit to \u201cnew\u2011construction\u201d status (e.g., by major renovation) to escape caps. | The **profitability gap** between building a new rental and building a market\u2011rate condo widens, **reducing new rental construction**. |\n| **Potential for \u201cstock\u2011purge\u201d** | Landlords may **convert** or **dem",
