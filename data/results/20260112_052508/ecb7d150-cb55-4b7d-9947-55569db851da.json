Outbreak risk \u2248\u202f1\u201310 cases per\u202f10\u202fmillion litres sold in the U.S., with a higher fatality rate in children, pregnant people, the elderly, and immunocompromised. | Pasteurisation (typically 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201chigh\u2011temperature, short\u2011time\u201d) kills >\u202f99.999\u202f% of vegetative bacteria, reducing outbreak risk to <\u202f0.1 cases per\u202f10\u202fmillion litres. |\n| **Nutrient composition** | Very similar to pasteurised milk for macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs) and most minerals. Small losses of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., B\u201112, C) and enzymes (e.g., lipase, alkaline phosphatase). Some proponents argue that live \u201cbeneficial\u201d microbes and bioactive proteins survive. | Heat destroys most native enzymes and reduces a few heat\u2011labile vitamins (B\u201112, C, folate) by <\u202f10\u202f% in most standard processes; overall nutrient profile remains essentially unchanged. |\n| **Probiotic/ \u201cgood\u201d bacteria** | May contain a diverse community of lactic\u2011acid bacteria that can survive digestion and potentially aid gut health \u2013 but the same environment also supports pathogens. | Commercial pasteurised milk is essentially sterile; probiotic benefits come only from added cultures (e.g., yogurt, kefir). |\n| **Legal status (U.S.)** | Legal to sell *directly* to consumers in 31 states (often with restrictions). Federal law prohibits interstate sale of raw milk for human consumption. | Legal nationwide; regulated by USDA/FSIS, state health departments, and the FDA. |\n| **Typical use** | Often consumed fresh, as \u201cfarm\u2011gate\u201d or \u201cfarm\u2011stand\u201d milk; sometimes used in cheese making that relies on native flora. | The default for supermarkets, schools, hospitals, and most food\u2011service operations. |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into the evidence, the scientific consensus, the remaining uncertainties, and the social\u2011cultural context that fuels the debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The science of pasteurisation  \n\n**What it does**  \n- **Goal:** Reduce the microbial load to a level that will not cause disease while preserving the milk\u2019s nutritional and sensory qualities.  \n- **Typical regimes** (U.S./EU):  \n  - **HTST (High\u2011Temp/Short\u2011Time):** 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fseconds (\u2248\u202f5\u2011log reduction of *C.\u202fperfringens* spores, >\u202f7\u2011log for most vegetative pathogens).  \n  - **UHT (Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temp):** 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20134\u202fseconds (commercially sterile, shelf\u2011stable for 6\u201112\u202fmonths).  \n- **What survives:** Most bacterial spores (e.g., *Clostridium* spp.) and some heat\u2011resistant enzymes; however, spores rarely cause illness in healthy adults because they need to germinate in the gut, a condition that is uncommon.\n\n**Evidence of effectiveness**  \n- **Epidemiology:** In the United States, the CDC reports **\u2248\u202f120\u2013150 food\u2011borne illness outbreaks** linked to raw milk or raw milk cheese each decade, compared with **\u2248\u202f1\u20132** outbreaks linked to pasteurised milk.  \n- **Risk\u2011modeling studies** (e.g., the 2015 *Risk Analysis* paper by *Koutsoumanis et\u202fal.*) estimate that **one death** may occur per **30\u202fmillion\u202flitres** of raw milk consumed, whereas the risk from pasteur",

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Pasteurisation Works \u2013 The Science Behind \u201cKill the Bad, Keep the Good\u201d\n\n| Step | What the heat does to the milk | Why the step matters for safety |\n|------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **1. Heating to a target temperature** (e.g., 72\u202f\u00b0C\u202f=\u202f161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fs in the standard HTST process) | \u2022 **Proteins unfold (denature)** \u2013 casein micelles stay intact, but many enzymes and bacterial proteins lose their three\u2011dimensional shape.<br>\u2022 **Cell membranes become fluid and leak** \u2013 phospholipid bilayers of bacteria melt, causing loss of cytoplasmic contents.<br>\u2022 **DNA/RNA strands become damaged** \u2013 heat can cause depurination and breakage, preventing replication. | Most vegetative (actively growing) bacteria cannot survive a temperature that disrupts their membranes and denatures essential enzymes. The 5\u2011log (100\u202f000\u2011fold) reduction target is enough that, even if a few cells survive, the probability that they are pathogenic is vanishingly small. |\n| **2. Holding (or \u201cpasteurisation plateau\u201d)** | The milk stays at the target temperature for the prescribed time (15\u202fs for HTST, 30\u202fs for LTLT). This ensures **uniform heat penetration** even in the coldest spot of the flow\u2011through heat exchanger. | Guarantees that the calculated log\u2011reduction is actually achieved; without a hold, some pockets could stay cooler and allow survivors. |\n| **3. Rapid cooling** (to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C) | \u2022 **Stops any further heat\u2011induced changes** (preventing over\u2011cooking, flavor loss).<br>\u2022 **Preserves heat\u2011labile nutrients** that would continue to degrade if the milk stayed warm. | The faster the milk is chilled, the less time heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (B\u201112, C, folate) have to degrade, and the less chance that any heat\u2011resistant spores could germinate. |\n| **4. Homogenisation (optional, usually done before pasteurisation)** | Mechanical shearing breaks fat globules into smaller, more stable particles. | Not a safety step, but it improves texture and prevents cream separation, which can otherwise create micro\u2011environments where bacteria could hide. |\n\n### What Gets Destroyed, and What Stays Intact?\n\n| Component | Effect of HTST pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs) | Effect of UHT (135\u202f\u00b0C/2\u20134\u202fs) |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Pathogenic vegetative bacteria** (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*) | >\u202f99.999\u202f% killed (\u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction). | >\u202f7\u2011log reduction \u2013 essentially sterile. |\n| **Spore\u2011forming bacteria** (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum* spores) | Mostly survive; spores are heat\u2011resistant. | Some spores are still viable, but the higher temperature reduces numbers. |\n| **Enzymes** (lipase, alkaline phosphatase, lactoperoxidase) | Inactivated (alkaline phosphatase is the standard \u201cindicator\u201d used to verify pasteurisation). | Completely inactivated. |\n| **Heat\u2011sensitive vitamins** (B\u201112, C, folate) | Loss of **\u2248\u202f5\u201315\u202f%** (depends on initial concentration and storage after pasteurisation). | Loss can rise to **\u2248\u202f20\u201330\u202f%** for vitamin C; B\u201112 loss similar to HTST. |\n| **Heat\u2011stable nutrients** (protein, calcium, phosphorus, most B\u2011vitamins like B\u20112, minerals, lactose) | **No measurable change** (<\u202f2\u202f% difference). | Minor changes (<\u202f5\u202f%). |\n| **Beneficial microbes** (lactic\u2011acid bacteria, *Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium*) | Almost all are killed; a few heat\u2011resistant strains may survive but are negligible. | Virtually none survive. |\n| **Flavor compounds** (volatile fatty acids, lactones) | Slight reduction of \u201ccooked\u201d notes; milk retains fresh taste. | More \u201ccooked\u201d or \u201ccaramelised\u201d flavor, longer shelf\u2011life but different sensory profile. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The heat level is high",
