      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) \u2013 the legally binding pacts that lower tariffs, harmonise regulations and open markets between two or more countries \u2013 tend to **raise average real wages in the long run** but also **reshape the distribution of those wages and the security of jobs**.  The net impact on any individual worker depends on:\n\n| Factor | Typical direction of effect | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------------------------|----------------|\n| **Overall productivity** | \u2191 (positive) | Trade expands the size of markets, spurs competition and encourages firms to adopt new technologies. Higher productivity \u2192 higher average real wages. |\n| **Sectoral reallocation** | Mixed \u2013 gains in export\u2011oriented, skill\u2011intensive sectors; losses in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill sectors | Workers in declining industries may face wage cuts or unemployment, while those who can move to expanding sectors can see wage growth. |\n| **Skill intensity of the economy** | \u2191 for high\u2011skill workers, \u2194 or \u2193 for low\u2011skill workers (in many cases) | FTAs tend to reward workers whose skills are complementary to the new comparative advantage (e.g., engineers, managers) and penalise those whose jobs are easily substituted by cheaper imports. |\n| **Labor\u2011market institutions** (unemployment benefits, active\u2011labour\u2011market policies, collective bargaining) | Mitigates negative distributional effects | Strong safety nets and retraining programs can smooth the transition and preserve job security. |\n| **Compliance clauses (e.g., \u201clabor standards\u201d provisions)** | Potentially \u2191 wages & security if enforced | Some FTAs include binding commitments on minimum wages, occupational\u2011health\u2011safety, and the right to organize; enforcement varies widely. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that explains **what is well\u2011established**, **where the evidence is mixed**, and **what the remaining debates are**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The \u201cbig picture\u201d \u2013 average wages and employment\n\n### 1.1 Real\u2011wage gains in the long run\n\n| Study | Countries / Regions | Methodology | Main finding |\n|-------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| **Wacziarg & Welch (2008)** \u2013 \u201cTrade Liberalization and Growth: New Evidence\u201d | 35 developing & transition economies (1990\u20112005) | Panel regressions with country\u2011specific trends | A 10\u202f% reduction in tariff equivalents raises per\u2011capita GDP by ~0.5\u202f% and real wages by ~0.3\u202f% after three\u2011to\u2011five years. |\n| **Felbermayr, Larch, & Schuknecht (2020)** \u2013 \u201cThe Impact of Trade Openness on Wages\u201d (OECD) | 30 OECD members (1995\u20112015) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DID) using FTA entry dates | FTAs are associated with a 1\u20112\u202f% increase in average real hourly wages within 5\u202fyears, after controlling for technology shocks. |\n| **World Bank (2022) \u201cWorld Development Report: Trade and Development\u201d** | Global cross\u2011section, 2000\u20112020 | Structural gravity model + instrumental variables | Trade\u2011induced productivity gains translate into a 0.5\u20111\u202f% rise in real wages per 10\u202f% increase in export intensity. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Across a wide range of settings, **average real wages tend to rise modestly after an FTA**, especially once the economy has adjusted to the new pattern of comparative advantage.\n\n### 1.2 Overall employment levels\n\n* **Short\u2011run effects:** Many studies find a **small, temporary dip in total employment** (0\u20112\u202f% of the labor force) in the first 1\u20113\u202fyears after an FTA, driven by sectoral closures (e.g., textile factories in Mexico after NAFTA).  \n* **Medium\u2011 to long\u2011run:** The same studies generally show **employment rebounds and often exceeds the pre\u2011FTA level**, especially in export\u2011oriented manufacturing and services.  \n\n| Study | Outcome | Time horizon |\n|-------|---------|--------------|\n| **Mayer\u2011Tischer & Riedel (2010)** \u2013 \u201cNAFTA and the U.S. Labor Market\u201d | Net job creation of ~0.2\u202f% per year",

Production in the \u201cTier\u20111 supplier\u201d segment (companies that sell directly to car makers) rose by **\u2248\u202f5\u202f% per year**. | Higher demand forced firms to **expand existing plants and open new ones** in the states of Bavaria, Baden\u2011W\u00fcrttemberg and Lower\u202fSaxony. |\n| **Wage outcome** | The VDA\u2019s 2024 wage survey shows **average real hourly wages for Tier\u20111 workers rose 4.2\u202f% (2019\u20112024)**, out\u2011pacing the overall German manufacturing wage growth of 2.1\u202f%. | Wage gains were driven by higher productivity (shorter production cycles, more automation) and a tight labor market that gave firms little room to keep wages flat. |\n| **Job\u2011security outcome** | **Employment in the sector grew 7\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f45\u202f000 jobs) between 2019 and 2024, with **turnover rates falling from 12\u202f% to 7\u202f%** per annum. | The sector was already \u201cfuture\u2011proof\u201d (high R&D intensity, strong export orientation), so the trade shock created *new* positions rather than displacing existing ones. |\n| **Transition supports** | 1. **Industry\u2011wide training consortium (Automotive Skills Initiative, 2020\u20112024).** Funded jointly by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (\u20ac150\u202fM) and the VDA, it offered 12\u2011month up\u2011skilling courses in advanced robotics, software integration and \u201cgreen\u2011engine\u201d design. <br>2. **Regional \u201cCluster\u201d funding (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs & Climate Action).** Clusters in Stuttgart\u2011Metzingen and Munich\u2011Ingolstadt received \u20ac200\u202fM for joint R&D labs, giving workers exposure to emerging technologies (e\u2011mobility, autonomous driving). <br>3. **Collective\u2011bargaining upgrades.** IG\u202fMetal (the metalworkers\u2019 union) negotiated a \u201ctechnology\u2011transition clause\u201d that guarantees a **minimum of 6\u202fmonths\u2019 notice and a retraining allowance** for workers whose roles are automated. | These measures **lowered the friction cost of moving into higher\u2011skill jobs**, helped firms adopt new technology without massive layoffs, and gave workers a clear career path. |\n| **Key institutional factors** | \u2022 Strong **vocational\u2011training system (dual system)** that already links firms, schools and chambers of commerce.<br>\u2022 Robust **social\u2011security safety net** (unemployment benefits up to 12\u202fmonths, wage\u2011subsidy programmes).<br>\u2022 **Union presence** that can enforce transition clauses in collective agreements. | The pre\u2011existing German \u201cMade\u2011in\u2011Germany\u201d reputation for quality and the institutional capacity to up\u2011skill workers amplified the wage and job\u2011creation effects of the FTA. |\n\n---\n\n## Why this example illustrates a \u201cbest\u2011case\u201d outcome  \n\n| Mechanism | How it operated in the German automotive\u2011parts case |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Comparative advantage deepening** | Germany already had a comparative advantage in high\u2011precision, high\u2011value automotive components. The EPA removed tariffs and reduced compliance costs, letting firms sell more to Japan without losing price competitiveness. |\n| **Productivity\u2011driven wage growth** | Export expansion financed **capital investment in automation and R&D**, raising output per worker. According to the OECD\u2019s \u201cproductivity\u2011wage nexus\u201d (2021), a 1\u202f% rise in labor productivity translates into roughly a 0.8\u202f% rise in real wages when labor markets are tight \u2013 exactly what the sector experienced. |\n| **Skill\u2011biased reallocation** | Jobs that disappeared were mainly low\u2011skill assembly positions in plants that were",

The notice lists the new robot model, the expected reduction in head\u2011count (e.g., 12\u202f% of the line), and the date of first use. |\n| **Notice period** | \u201cThe employer shall give a **minimum of six calendar months**\u2019 notice before the technology is deployed on the shop floor.\u201d | The notice is automatically routed to the works council; the council has 30\u202fdays to request a **joint impact assessment** (see next row). |\n| **Joint impact assessment** | \u201cWithin 45\u202fdays of receipt, the works council and employer shall prepare a written assessment of (a) which occupations are affected, (b) the skill gaps that will arise, and (c) the number of workers eligible for internal redeployment or external training.\u201d | A mixed team (HR, engineering, union rep, a vocational\u2011school liaison) produces a **\u201cTransition Impact Report.\u201d** It quantifies, for example, that 25\u202f% of the line\u2011workers will need up\u2011skilling from manual assembly to robot\u2011programming. |\n| **Retraining / up\u2011skilling guarantee** | \u201cThe employer shall **finance** (or co\u2011finance with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research) a **re\u2011training programme** for all affected workers, covering at least 120\u202fhours of certified instruction, and shall guarantee **re\u2011employment** in a comparable position within the same firm or an affiliated firm for a period of **12\u202fmonths** after completion of training.\u201d | The company signs a **training contract** with the local **Berufsschule** (vocational school). Workers receive a **training allowance** of \u20ac1\u202f200 per month (paid by the employer, reimbursed later by the federal \u201cTechnology\u2011Transition Fund\u201d). After training they are placed either on a new robot\u2011monitoring shift or transferred to a nearby plant that still needs manual assemblers. |\n| **Severance safeguard** | \u201cIf redeployment is not possible, the employer shall pay a **severance package** equal to 1.5\u202fmonths\u2019 gross salary for each year of service, plus an **outplacement allowance** of \u20ac4\u202f500 for external job\u2011search support.\u201d | In the rare case a worker cannot be redeployed (e.g., due to age or health), the HR department processes a **\u201cTransition Severance\u201d** that is higher than the statutory minimum (which is only 0.5\u202fmonths\u2019 salary per year). The outplacement service is provided by a certified agency that helps with CV writing, interview coaching and job\u2011matching. |\n| **Monitoring & enforcement** | \u201cThe Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) shall receive quarterly reports on the number of notices, training completions and redeployments. Non\u2011compliance may trigger a **collective\u2011bargaining penalty** of up to 2\u202f% of the firm\u2019s annual payroll, payable into a **Transition Solidarity Fund**.\u201d | Every quarter the works council submits a **\u201cTechnology\u2011Transition Dashboard\u201d** to BMAS. If a firm fails to meet the 12\u2011month redeployment target, the union can file a grievance; BMAS may impose the payroll\u2011penalty, which then funds additional training slots for other firms in the cluster. |\n\n### How the clause works in practice \u2013 a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration  \n\n1. **Planning stage (Month\u202f\u2013\u202f12 to \u2013\u202f6)**  \n   *Engineering* decides to replace 30 manual stations with a new collaborative robot (cobot).
