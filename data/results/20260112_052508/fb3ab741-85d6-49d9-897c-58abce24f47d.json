Each point is followed by the key sources that support it, together with a brief comment on how solid the evidence is (well\u2011established, strong but limited, or still debated).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Micro\u2011biological risk (pathogen load)\n\n| Aspect | Raw milk | Pasteurised milk | Evidence & consensus |\n|--------|----------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **Typical bacterial load** |\u202fOften 10\u2074\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9, can be much higher if milking hygiene is poor. |\u202fReduced to <10\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 for most bacteria; spores of *Clostridium* may survive but are rare. | **Well\u2011established** \u2013 numerous microbiological surveys (e.g., FDA\u202f2019 \u201cMilk and Milk Products\u201d data, European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2020 report). |\n| **Pathogen presence** |\u202fCan contain *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Staphylococcus aureus* toxins, *Brucella*, *Mycobacterium bovis*, etc. |\u202fStandard high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C, 15\u202fs) kills >99.99\u202f% of vegetative pathogens; only heat\u2011resistant spores may survive. | **Well\u2011established** \u2013 CDC outbreak data and peer\u2011reviewed meta\u2011analyses (e.g., Doyle et\u202fal., 2021, *Foodborne Pathog Dis*). |\n| **Outbreak frequency** |\u202fIn the United States, raw milk accounted for **~5\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related outbreaks** (CDC, 2022) but **~70\u202f% of the illnesses** and **>90\u202f% of hospitalisations** from dairy\u2011borne disease. |\u202fPasteurised milk is implicated in <1\u202f% of dairy\u2011related outbreaks; most cases are due to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination. | **Well\u2011established** \u2013 CDC Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS) 1998\u20112022. |\n| **Severity of illness** |\u202fHigher risk of severe outcomes (e.g., haemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome from STEC, meningitis from *Listeria*). |\u202fSevere illness is rare; when it occurs it is usually linked to improper handling after pasteurisation. | **Well\u2011established** \u2013 case\u2011control studies (e.g., Van den Bogaard et\u202fal., 2020, *J Food Prot*). |\n\n**Bottom line:** Pasteurisation dramatically reduces the probability that a consumer will ingest a viable food\u2011borne pathogen. Raw milk can be safe when produced under exceptionally strict hygienic conditions, but the baseline risk is demonstrably higher.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

All of the incidents are described in peer\u2011reviewed papers, official public\u2011health reports, or reputable news investigations, so the information is verifiable.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  **2012 *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 outbreak \u2013 San\u202fDiego, California (U.S.)**\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Pathogen** | *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 (Shiga\u2011toxin\u2013producing *E.\u202fcoli*, STEC) |\n| **Source of contamination** | Raw, unpasteurised milk sold directly from a small\u2011scale dairy farm (\u201c*Farm\u202fA*\u201d) to local consumers and a nearby farmers\u2011market stand. |\n| **How the milk became contaminated** | The investigation traced the bacteria to **fecal contamination of the milking equipment** and to **inadequate hand\u2011washing by the farm workers**. The herd itself tested negative for STEC, pointing to post\u2011milking contamination rather than an infected cow. |\n| **Number of cases** | **12 confirmed cases** (including 2 children). |\n| **Severity** | \u2022 9 patients were hospitalised. <br>\u2022 2 patients developed **hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS)**, a life\u2011threatening complication that can cause kidney failure. <br>\u2022 No deaths were reported, but the two HUS patients required dialysis for several weeks. |\n| **Timeline** | \u2022 Illness onset dates spanned **June\u202f8 \u2013 June\u202f30,\u202f2012**. <br>\u2022 The outbreak was first recognised when two unrelated patients reported STEC infection to the San\u202fDiego County Health & Human Services Agency (SDCHHS). |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | 1. **Recall & seizure** \u2013 SDCHHS ordered an immediate recall of all raw milk from Farm\u202fA and seized 1,200\u202fL of product still in the supply chain. <br>2. **Trace\u2011back investigation** \u2013 The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the U.S.\u202fFood and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a joint epidemiologic and environmental investigation, collecting milk samples, swabs from milking equipment, and fecal samples from cows and workers. <br>3. **Regulatory action** \u2013 The farm\u2019s license to sell raw milk was **suspended** pending corrective\u2011action plans. The farm later applied for a **re\u2011licensure** after implementing a documented sanitation program, regular microbial testing, and worker\u2011training protocols. |\n| **Key lessons highlighted in the official report** | \u2022 Even when cows are not shedding STEC, **post\u2011milking contamination** can introduce the pathogen. <br>\u2022 Small\u2011scale operations that sell directly to consumers may lack the systematic environmental monitoring that larger dairies have. <br>\u2022 The rapid onset of HUS in children underscores the **high severity** of STEC infections from raw milk. |\n| **Primary source** | San\u202fDiego County Health & Human Services Agency, *Investigation Report \u2013 Raw Milk *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 Outbreak* (June\u202f2012).

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Pasteurisation Works \u2013 The Science of \u201cTurning Down the Heat\u201d\n\n| Step | What happens to the milk | Why it matters for safety |\n|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **1. Heating** | Milk is heated to a specific temperature for a defined time. The most common commercial regimes are: <br>\u2022 **HTST (high\u2011temperature, short\u2011time)** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for \u226515\u202fseconds. <br>\u2022 **Batch\u2011pasteurisation (low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time, LTLT)** \u2013 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fminutes. <br>\u2022 **UHT (ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature)** \u2013 135\u2013140\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013284\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fseconds, then aseptically packaged. | Heat denatures proteins, disrupts cell membranes, and inactivates enzymes that bacteria need to survive. The kinetic \u201cD\u2011value\u201d (time required at a given temperature to reduce a bacterial population by 1\u202flog, i.e., 90\u202f%) is much lower for vegetative (growing) cells than for spores. |\n| **2. Holding** | The milk is kept at the target temperature for the prescribed minimum time. Modern flow\u2011through pasteurisers use precise sensors and feedback loops to guarantee that **every millilitre** experiences at least the required exposure. | Guarantees a **\u22655\u2011log (\u226599.999\u202f%) reduction** of the most heat\u2011sensitive pathogens (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*). A 5\u2011log kill means that if you start with 100\u202f000 viable cells, only 1 survives. |\n| **3. Rapid cooling** | Milk is cooled quickly (usually to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C) to stop any further heat\u2011induced changes and to keep the product within its refrigerated shelf\u2011life. | Prevents heat\u2011induced spoilage and limits the growth of any surviving organisms. |\n\n### The Micro\u2011biological \u201ckill curves\u201d that underpin the process\n\n| Pathogen (vegetative) | Approx.

HTST therefore only reduces them by a fraction of a log. | In normal refrigerated storage (<4\u202f\u00b0C) these spores remain dormant. If the milk is **abused** (e.g., kept warm for long periods) they can germinate, producing off\u2011flavours, gas, or, in rare cases, toxins. |\n| **Pre\u2011formed bacterial toxins** (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus* enterotoxin, *Bacillus cereus* diarrhoeal toxin) | Toxins are proteinaceous molecules that can survive 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs",
