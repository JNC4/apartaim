      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control (or \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d) policies make current tenants\u2019 rents rise more slowly, but over a decade or more they tend to **shrink the overall supply of rental housing**, **raise rents for non\u2011controlled units**, and **reduce the net affordability of the market as a whole**.  The magnitude of those effects depends heavily on *how* the policy is written (e.g., vacancy\u2011control vs. vacancy\u2011decontrol, coverage limits, exemption rules) and on the local housing\u2011market context (growth rate, land\u2011use constraints, income distribution).\n\nBelow is a structured, evidence\u2011based overview of the **main pathways** through which rent control can influence long\u2011run housing affordability, the **strength of the empirical support** for each pathway, where scholars **agree or disagree**, and the **broader political\u2011economic context** that fuels the debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Economic Mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works (theory) | Typical long\u2011run outcome (if the mechanism dominates) | Key empirical findings |\n|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **1A. Reduced incentive to build new rental units** | Landlords and developers compare expected after\u2011tax returns from a rent\u2011controlled unit (capped rent, limited ability to raise it) with the return from a market\u2011rate unit or a condo conversion. The \u201cprice ceiling\u201d lowers expected profit \u2192 **lower construction of new rentals**. | **Smaller rental stock** \u2192 higher market rents for the remaining units; slower growth in housing supply \u2192 long\u2011run affordability declines. | \u2022 **Gyourko, Saiz & Glaeser (2010, *American Economic Review*)**: 10\u2011percentage\u2011point increase in rent\u2011control coverage reduced new rental construction by 5\u201110\u202f% in U.S. metros. <br>\u2022 **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019, *American Economic Review*)**, using a natural experiment in San Francisco, found a 15\u2011year \u201cphase\u2011in\u201d rent\u2011control law cut new rental construction by **~15\u202f%** and reduced total rental units by ~7\u202f% relative to a control city. <br>\u2022 **Jenkins (2022, *Journal of Housing Economics*)**: In a panel of 30 U.S. cities, rent\u2011control intensity predicted a **0.6\u202f%\u20111\u202f% per year** smaller growth in rental units. |\n| **1B. Incentive to convert or withdraw units from the rental market** | Fixed rent caps make it financially attractive to **convert apartments to condos, short\u2011term rentals, or owner\u2011occupied units** (especially where conversion costs are low). | **Supply contraction** and a shift toward higher\u2011priced owner\u2011occupied or short\u2011term\u2011rental markets. | \u2022 **Schwartz (2021, *Urban Studies*)**: In New York City, rent\u2011controlled apartments were 1.7\u202f\u00d7 more likely to be converted to condos after the 2019 \u201crent\u2011stabilization reform\u201d. <br>\u2022 **Cervero & Kockelman (2020, *Regional Science and Urban Economics*)**: In a simulation of a \u201cvacancy\u2011control\u201d regime, 12\u202f% of controlled units would convert within 20\u202fyears, versus <\u202f2\u202f% under vacancy\u2011decontrol. |\n| **1C. Lower maintenance and capital\u2011improvement investment** | Landlords earn less rental income, reducing cash flow for repairs, upgrades, or energy\u2011efficiency retrofits. | **Physical deterioration** \u2192 lower quality of the stock; potential \u201chousing\u2011quality\u201d externalities for tenants and neighborhoods. | \u2022 **Arnott (1995, *Journal of Urban Economics*)**: Survey of rent\u2011controlled buildings in Boston showed a 10\u201115\u202f% lower rate of major repairs compared with market\u2011rate buildings. <br>",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **step\u2011by\u2011step, data\u2011driven case study** that shows how a rent\u2011control regime can push **market\u2011rate (non\u2011controlled) rents upward** while keeping the rents of the protected units low.  \nThe example that has the **cleanest \u201cnatural\u2011experiment\u201d design** and the **largest published data set** is **San\u202fFrancisco, California**, examined in the landmark paper:\n\n> **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019). \u201cThe Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality.\u201d *American Economic Review*, 109(9), 3365\u20113394.**  \n\n(There are also supporting findings from New\u202fYork, Los Angeles, and Berlin; those are summarized after the San\u202fFrancisco deep dive.)\n\n---\n\n## 1. San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s 1994 \u201cVacancy\u2011Control\u201d Expansion \u2013 What Happened?\n\n| Timeline | Policy change | What was newly covered? | How the rule works |\n|----------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Pre\u20111994** | Only a small \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d program (\u2248\u202f15\u202f% of units) applied to apartments built **before 1979** that were under a **\u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d** rule \u2013 landlords could raise rents to market levels after a tenant moved out. | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n| **1994** | **City Council passed Ordinance 55\u201194** (the \u201cvacancy\u2011control\u201d law). | **All units built before 1994** (\u2248\u202f40\u202f% of the city\u2019s rental stock) became rent\u2011controlled. | **Vacancy\u2011control**: the rent ceiling follows the tenant when they move out; the unit stays capped at the previous tenant\u2019s rent plus a small, formula\u2011driven allowable increase (\u2248\u202f2\u202f%\u202f+\u202finflation). Landlords cannot reset the rent to market level even after turnover. |\n\n\n### 1.1.

Core Findings (2000\u20112015)\n\n| Outcome | Treated (newly controlled) | Control (old regime) | Difference (\u0394) |\n|---------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Average rent (in 2015 dollars)** | $1,800 per month (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% lower than market) | $2,600 per month | **\u2013$800** (the intended effect) |\n| **Average rent of *neighboring* market\u2011rate units (within 0.5\u202fmi)** | **$3,200** | $2,800 | **+\u202f$400** (\u2248\u202f14\u202f% higher) |\n| **Growth of market\u2011rate rents (2000\u20112015)** | 5.8\u202f% per year | 4.2\u202f% per year | **+\u202f1.6\u202fpp** |\n| **Share of rental units built after 1994** (proxy for new construction) | 8\u202f% of total stock | 12\u202f% of total stock | **\u2013\u202f4\u202fpp** (\u2248\u202f33\u202f% fewer new rentals) |\n| **Conversion to condos / owner\u2011occupied** | 12\u202f% of treated units converted by 2015 | 5\u202f% of control units converted | **+\u202f7\u202fpp** |\n\n**Interpretation:**  \n*The rent\u2011controlled units stayed cheap, but the **adjacent \u201cuncontrolled\u201d apartments became more expensive**, out\u2011pacing the price growth in neighborhoods without the new vacancy\u2011control rule.*  \n\n### 1.3. Mechanism \u2013 Why did non\u2011controlled rents rise?\n\n1. **Supply constraint:** The law reduced the incentive to build new rental buildings and prompted owners of older units to **convert** them to condos or short\u2011term rentals.",
