Outbreaks traced to pasteurised milk are extremely rare and usually stem from post\u2011process contamination (e.g., dirty equipment). |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme profile** | \u2022 Some heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., B\u2011vitamins, vitamin C) and enzymes (e.g., lipase, alkaline phosphatase) remain intact. <br>\u2022 Probiotic bacteria present in the raw milk may survive. | \u2022 Small loss of heat\u2011sensitive nutrients (\u22482\u20135\u202f% of vitamin C, B\u2011vitamins). <br>\u2022 Enzymes are inactivated (used as a quality check \u2013 alkaline phosphatase activity should be zero in properly pasteurised milk). |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | 5\u20137\u202fdays under refrigeration, but rapid bacterial growth can cause spoilage if temperature control lapses. | 14\u201321\u202fdays (or longer with ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) processing) because the initial bacterial load is low and enzymes that cause spoilage are destroyed. |\n| **Regulatory stance (U.S.)** | Federal law permits raw milk sales only in states that specifically allow it; many states ban it outright. The FDA classifies raw milk as a \u201cpotentially hazardous food.\u201d | Required by the Pasteurization Act of 1944; all milk sold in grocery stores must be pasteurised unless it is labeled \u201craw\u201d and sold under state\u2011specific exemptions. |\n| **International consensus** | \u2022 WHO, EFSA, CDC, and most national food\u2011safety agencies *recommend* against consuming raw milk for the general public. | \u2022 Universally accepted as the standard for commercial milk safety. |\n\n---\n\n### 1. Why pasteurisation improves safety\n\n1. **Heat kills the most common milk\u2011borne pathogens.**  \n   - *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 is reduced by >5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 (99.999\u202f%); *Salmonella* and *Listeria* are similarly eliminated at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs.  \n2. **It inactivates enzymes that can support bacterial growth** (e.g., lipases that break down fats, producing off\u2011flavours and a substrate for spoilage microbes).  \n3. **It provides a measurable quality control point.** The FDA requires that alkaline phosphatase be absent after pasteurisation; its presence indicates insufficient heating.\n\n### 2.

The median age was 31\u202fyears (range 5\u202f\u2013\u202f68). |\n| **How the source was identified** | 1. **Epidemiologic interview** \u2013 90\u202f% of ill people reported drinking raw milk from the same dairy.<br>2. **Laboratory testing** \u2013 stool samples from patients yielded *C.\u202fjejuni* with an identical pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern.<br>3. **Environmental testing** \u2013 the dairy\u2019s bulk tank and samples of the raw milk tested positive for the same PFGE pattern.<br>4. **Trace\u2011back** \u2013 the dairy obtained its cows from a herd known to have a sub\u2011clinical *Campylobacter* infection, and the herd\u2019s water source was not treated. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | The California Department of Public Health issued a **recall** of the dairy\u2019s raw milk, ordered a temporary shutdown, and required the farm to implement a herd\u2011health plan (regular testing, water\u2011treatment, and a mandatory **pasteurisation** step before any future sales). |\n\n#### Why pasteurisation would have stopped this outbreak  \n\n| Step | What pasteurisation does | Effect on *Campylobacter jejuni* |\n|------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Heat exposure** | Standard HTST pasteurisation = 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds. | *C.\u202fjejuni* is highly heat\u2011sensitive; a 5\u2011log (99.999\u202f%) reduction is achieved at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fseconds, so the HTST regimen easily kills it. |\n| **Immediate kill** | No surviving cells remain in the milk that reaches the consumer. | The bacterial load that caused illness (typically >10\u00b3\u201310\u2074\u202fCFU per 100\u202fmL) would be reduced to <1\u202fCFU, well below the infectious dose (\u2248500\u20131\u202f000\u202fCFU for *C.\u202fjejuni*). |\n| **Post\u2011process safety margin** | Pasteurised milk is then rapidly cooled and stored under refrigeration, limiting any subsequent growth of any residual microbes. | Even if a few spores somehow survived (unlikely for *Campylobacter*), the cold chain prevents them from multiplying to dangerous levels. |\n| **Quality\u2011control check** | The FDA requires that alkaline phosphatase be inactivated; a failed test triggers a recall before the product reaches consumers. | This additional checkpoint would have caught any under\u2011processed batch before distribution. |\n\n**Bottom line:** If the same raw milk had been subjected to an approved HTST pasteurisation step, the *Campylobacter* bacteria present in the bulk tank would have been destroyed before the milk left the farm, eliminating the exposure pathway that produced the 55 illnesses.\n\n---\n\n### Other recent, well\u2011documented raw\u2011milk outbreaks (for context)\n\n| Year | Country | Pathogen | Cases (approx.) | Source |\n|------|---------|----------|----------------|--------|\n| 2020 | United\u202fKingdom | *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 | 12 | Raw goat\u2019s milk from a farm\u2011gate stall |\n| 2021 | Canada (Ontario) | *Salmonella* Typhimurium | 24 | Raw cow\u2019s milk sold at a farmers\u2019 market |\n| 2023 | United\u202fStates (Michigan) | *Listeria monocytogenes* | 7 (2 fetal deaths) | Raw milk from a small\u2011scale dairy |\n\nThese incidents all followed the same investigative pattern: epidemiologic link \u2192",

Collection & pre\u2011filtering** | Milk is pumped from the bulk tank through a coarse filter that removes large particles (hair, debris). | Reduces the load of *physical* contaminants that could shield bacteria from heat. |\n| **2. Rapid heating to a defined temperature** | The milk is pumped through a heat\u2011exchange system (plate\u2011type or tubular). Two regimes dominate in commercial dairies:  <br>\u2022 **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** \u2013 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin (the \u201cbatch\u201d method). <br>\u2022 **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (the \u201ccontinuous\u2011flow\u201d method).  <br>Some specialty products use **Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temperature (UHT)** \u2013 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs, creating milk that can be stored at room temperature. | Heat denatures proteins, disrupts cell membranes, and inactivates enzymes that bacteria need to survive. The chosen temperature\u2011time combination is calibrated to achieve a **\u22655\u2011log\u2081\u2080 reduction** (\u226599.999\u202f%) of the most heat\u2011resistant milk\u2011borne pathogen, *Coxiella burnetii* (the organism on which the original Pasteur\u2019s test was based). |\n| **3. Immediate cooling** | After the heating zone, the milk passes through a second heat\u2011exchange that brings it down to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C (\u224839\u202f\u00b0F) within seconds. | Cooling \u201cfreezes\u201d the kill\u2011curve: any bacteria that survived the heat step are now in a refrigerated environment that limits further growth. |\n| **4. Homogenisation (optional, usually after pasteurisation)** | Milk is forced through a high\u2011pressure valve that breaks fat globules into \u22645\u202f\u00b5m droplets. | Improves texture and prevents cream separation; it does **not** affect safety. |\n| **5. Packaging under aseptic conditions** | Milk is filled into sterile containers (cartons, bottles, or bags) in a clean\u2011room environment. | Prevents **post\u2011process contamination**, the only way pathogens could re\u2011appear after a correctly performed pasteurisation. |\n| **6. Quality\u2011control checks** | \u2022 **Alkaline phosphatase test** \u2013 this enzyme is destroyed at 72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs; a positive test indicates under\u2011processing. <br>\u2022 **Colony\u2011forming\u2011unit (CFU) counts** on random samples. <br>\u2022 **Temperature loggers** that record every batch\u2019s heating profile. | Provides a safety net: if any batch fails, it is automatically rejected before leaving the plant. |\n\n---\n\n### The microbiological math that makes the process \u201csafe\u201d\n\n| Term | Definition | Typical value for milk\u2011borne pathogens |\n|------|------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **D\u2011value** | Time (or seconds) at a given temperature required to reduce the bacterial population by 1\u202flog\u2081\u2080 (90\u202f%). | *C.\u202fburnetii* at 63\u202f\u00b0C \u2248 2\u202fmin; *Listeria* at 72\u202f\u00b0C \u2248 2\u202fs. |\n| **Z\u2011value** | Temperature increase needed to reduce the D\u2011value by ten\u2011fold. | \u2248 5\u20137\u202f\u00b0C for most milk pathogens. |\n| **Target log\u2011reduction** | The number of log\u2081\u2080 reductions the process must achieve. | Regulations (U.S., EU, Canada, etc.) require **\u22655\u2011log\u2081\u2080** for *C.\u202fburnetii*, which automatically gives >5\u2011log reductions for *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria*, *Campylobacter*. |\n| **Resulting pathogen level** | Starting at a worst\u2011case load of 10\u2074\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU/mL (raw milk can contain this many bacteria), a 5\u2011log",
