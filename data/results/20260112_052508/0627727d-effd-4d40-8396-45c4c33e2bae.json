      "truthbot_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a quick reminder**\n\nQE is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large quantities of financial assets (usually government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities) with newly created reserves.  The aim is to lower longer\u2011term interest rates, improve the functioning of credit markets, and lift aggregate demand when the policy\u2011rate is already near zero.\n\nBecause QE works through *financial* markets, its effects are filtered through the ownership of those markets, the structure of credit, and the expectations of households, firms, and investors.
