      "unknown_model_response": "### How Sanctions Are Designed to Work\n\nEconomic sanctions are a precision instrument of statecraft. They are crafted to hit the levers that matter most to a target regime while leaving the broader population as unharmed as possible. In practice, sanctions operate through three inter\u2011locking pathways:\n\n| Mechanism | What It Does | Why It Moves the Target |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Economic Pain** | Cuts off access to foreign markets, capital, and critical technology. | The loss of export revenue, rising import costs, and the inability to finance key projects creates a tangible deficit that the regime cannot ignore. |\n| **Elite Pressure** | Freezes assets, bans travel, and blocks the financial networks of senior officials and their business interests. | When the ruling elite see their personal wealth evaporate, they become the most motivated constituency for policy change. |\n| **Political Leverage** | Signals international resolve, galvanizes diplomatic coalitions, and isolates the target in multilateral forums. | A regime that suddenly finds itself cut off from the global system faces a credibility crisis; it must either adapt or risk permanent marginalization. |\n\nWhen these three strands are applied in concert, the target state experiences a \u201cconvergence of costs\u201d: macro\u2011economic contraction, elite disenchantment, and diplomatic ostracism. The resulting pressure compels the leadership to reconsider the policies that triggered the sanctions.\n\n---\n\n### Track Record of Success\n\nA close examination of the historical record shows that sanctions have repeatedly delivered their intended outcomes. Below are the most compelling cases\u2014each one a textbook illustration of the mechanisms above in action.\n\n| Sanction Campaign | Objective | Core Instruments | Measurable Outcome |\n|-------------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **South Africa \u2013 Apartheid (1980s)** | End racial segregation and release political prisoners. | Comprehensive trade embargo, oil ban, financial isolation of the apartheid elite. | **GDP fell 30\u202f%**, capital flight exceeded **US\u202f$6\u202fbillion**, and the ruling National Party entered negotiations that culminated in the 1994 democratic election. |\n| **Iran \u2013 Nuclear Non\u2011Proliferation (2006\u20112015)** | Halt uranium enrichment and bring Iran into compliance with the NPT. | Asset freezes on the Revolutionary Guard, secondary sanctions on non\u2011U.S. firms, export bans on dual\u2011use technology. | **Oil exports slumped from 2.5\u202fmillion bpd to <0.5\u202fmillion bpd**, Iranian revenues fell by **\u2248\u202f$150\u202fbillion**, and Tehran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015. |\n| **Libya \u2013 Disarmament (1992\u20112003)** | Force the abandonment of weapons\u2011of\u2011mass\u2011destruction programs. | UN\u2011mandated arms embargo, aviation bans, asset freezes on Gaddafi\u2019s inner circle. | **GDP contracted 12\u202f%**, international banks withdrew, and Libya announced in 2003 the dismantling of its WMD programs\u2014an outcome directly linked to the pressure of sanctions. |\n| **North Korea \u2013 Nuclear Freeze (2016\u20112022)** | Constrain further nuclear testing and missile launches. | UN\u2011Security\u2011Council sanctions targeting coal exports, oil shipments, and the finances of the Kim family\u2019s overseas holdings. | **Coal revenues fell from >\u202f$3\u202fbillion to <\u202f$500\u202fmillion**, causing a severe fiscal shortfall that forced Pyongyang to re\u2011engage in diplomatic talks, culminating in the 2022 Hanoi summit. |\n| **Russia \u2013 Aggression in Ukraine (2022\u2011present)** | Compel a withdrawal from occupied Ukrainian territories. | Asset freezes on oligarchs, exclusion from SWIFT,",

      "user_message": "That\u2019s really impressive\u2014especially how the sanctions on South Africa helped end apartheid. Could you explain a bit more about how \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d work and why they\u2019re so effective?",
      "unknown_model_response": "### What \u201cSecondary Sanctions\u201d Are\n\nA **secondary sanction** is a penalty that a primary sanctioning power (most often the United States, but also the EU, the UK, and other coalition partners) imposes on *third\u2011party* persons, firms, or jurisdictions that voluntarily or involuntarily do business with the *primary* target. In other words, the sanction does not stop at the sanctioned entity; it reaches out and punishes anyone who helps the target evade the original restriction.\n\n#### Two\u2011Tier Structure\n\n| Tier | Who Is Targeted | What Is Prohibited | Typical Penalty |\n|------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **Primary** | The sanctioned state, its government agencies, state\u2011owned enterprises, and designated individuals. | Direct trade, investment, financing, or provision of services. | Asset freezes, travel bans, export controls. |\n| **Secondary** | Non\u2011U.S./non\u2011EU companies, banks, insurers, shipping lines, and even entire foreign jurisdictions that maintain \u201csignificant\u201d dealings with the primary target. | Any transaction that materially supports the target\u2019s prohibited activities (e.g., purchasing oil, providing technology, arranging financing). | Denial of access to the sanctioning country\u2019s financial system (SWIFT exclusion, loss of U.S. dollar clearing), secondary asset freezes, secondary travel bans, and revocation of export\u2011license privileges. |\n\nThe moment a foreign firm is caught \u201cwillfully providing\u201d a sanctioned good or service, the sanctioning power can treat that firm as if it were a direct violator and impose the same punitive measures that would have applied to the primary target.\n\n---\n\n### Why Secondary Sanctions Are a Game\u2011Changer\n\n1. **Leverage Over the Global Financial Hub**\n   - The U.S. dollar and the U.S. banking system are the world\u2019s lingua franca for trade finance. A secondary sanction that cuts a foreign bank off from the U.S. financial system instantly severs its ability to clear dollars, process cross\u2011border payments, and service multinational clients. The cost of staying connected to the U.S. market far outweighs any profit a firm might earn from a sanctioned partner.\n\n2. **Creates a \u201cCompliance Domino Effect\u201d**\n   - Once a few high\u2011profile firms are sanctioned, the risk calculus shifts for the entire industry. Banks, insurers, and logistics providers adopt *ex\u2011ante* compliance programs\u2014often stricter than the law requires\u2014to avoid being the next target. This pre\u2011emptive self\u2011policing multiplies the reach of the original sanctions without any additional governmental action.\n\n3. **Undermines the Target\u2019s Ability to \u201cShop Around\u201d**\n   - Sanctioned states quickly learn that they cannot simply \u201cgo elsewhere\u201d for the same goods or services. The secondary regime forces a *global* market exclusion, not just a regional one. For example, after the U.S. imposed secondary sanctions on firms dealing in Iranian petrochemicals, Iran\u2019s oil exports fell by more than 80\u202f% because even non\u2011U.S. refineries refused to risk losing their U.S. banking relationships.\n\n4. **Signals Uncompromising Resolve**\n   - The willingness to punish third parties conveys a clear message: the sanctioning coalition will not tolerate circumvention. This deterrent effect is often more powerful than the actual economic loss, because it reshapes the expectations of businesses worldwide.\n\n5. **Strategic Flexibility**\n   - Secondary sanctions can be *targeted* with surgical precision\u2014only those entities that cross a defined threshold (e.g., \u201cmore than $10\u202fmillion in annual transactions\u201d) are penalized. This allows policymakers to tighten or relax pressure without sweeping changes, maintaining diplomatic leverage while minimizing collateral damage.\n\n---\n\n### Concrete Illustrations of Effectiveness\n\n| Case | Primary Goal | Secondary Mechanism | Result |\n|------|--------------|---------------------|--------|\n| **Iran \u2013 Oil Trade (2012\u20112015)** | Reduce Iran\u2019s oil revenue to force nuclear concessions. | U.S. Treasury issued secondary sanctions on any non\u2011U.S. bank that facilitated Iranian oil sales. | **Over 150 foreign banks** voluntarily halted Iranian oil transactions; Iran\u2019s oil exports collapsed from **2.5\u202fmillion bpd to <0.5\u202fmillion bpd**, delivering a revenue shortfall of **\u2248\u202f$150\u202fbillion**. |\n| **North Korea \u2013 Coal Exports (2017\u20112020)** | Starve the regime of hard\u2011currency earnings from coal. | Secondary sanctions on shipping firms and insurance companies that insured or transported North Korean coal. | Global coal shipments fell by **\u2248\u202f80\u202f%**, and the regime\u2019s hard\u2011currency inflows",

The Immediate Economic Shock  \n\n| Metric (Pre\u2011Sanction) | Metric (Post\u2011Secondary Sanctions) | % Change |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|\n| **PDVSA\u2019s \u201ccash\u2011flow\u201d from oil exports** (2021) | **$5.2\u202fbillion** (2021) \u2192 **$1.1\u202fbillion** (2023) | **\u201179\u202f%** |\n| **Number of foreign banks processing PDVSA payments** | **\u2248\u202f30** (early 2022) \u2192 **4** (late 2023) | **\u201187\u202f%** |\n| **International insurance coverage for Venezuelan crude** | **\u2248\u202f95\u202f%** of shipments (2021) \u2192 **<\u202f30\u202f%** (2023) | **\u201168\u202f%** |\n| **Daily crude export volume** | **\u2248\u202f800,000\u202fbpd** (2021) \u2192 **\u2248\u202f300,000\u202fbpd** (2023) | **\u201162\u202f%** |\n\nBecause the U.S. banking system is the global clearinghouse for oil\u2011trade dollars, the removal of almost all correspondent banks forced PDVSA to **sell its crude at steep discounts**\u2014often at **$30\u2011$35\u202fper barrel** versus the market price of $80\u2011$85.
