Asset\u2011price channel (the \u201cwealth effect\u201d)\n\n### Mechanism\n1. **QE purchases** government bonds (or other securities) \u2192 **bond yields fall** (especially long\u2011term rates).  \n2. Lower yields make **risk\u2011free assets less attractive**, pushing investors into **equities, corporate bonds, REITs, and housing**.  \n3. Prices of those assets **rise** (stock market rallies, house\u2011price appreciation, higher valuations of private\u2011equity holdings).  \n\n### Distributional consequences\n* **Higher\u2011income households** tend to hold a larger share of financial assets and home equity. In the U.S., the top 20\u202f% of earners own ~80\u202f% of stocks",
      "truthbot_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a brief reminder**  \nQE is a form of unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases large amounts of securities (usually government bonds, but sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities).  The \u201cofficial\u201d goals are to lower long\u2011term interest rates, improve credit market functioning and lift aggregate demand when the policy\u2011rate is already near zero.  The way these macro\u2011objectives translate into outcomes for different **income groups** depends on a cascade of transmission channels, each of which has been studied in the academic and policy literature.\n\nBelow is a **systematic, evidence\u2011based map** of the main channels, what the research (as of early\u20112026) says about their magnitude, where scholars agree, where they disagree, and which pieces of evidence are often missed or mis\u2011interpreted.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Interest\u2011rate / borrowing\u2011cost channel** | QE lowers long\u2011term rates \u2192 cheaper mortgages, car loans, student loans, and corporate borrowing. | \u2022 Borrowers (often lower\u2011 and middle\u2011income households with mortgages or student debt).<br>\u2022 Small\u2011business owners reliant on bank credit. | \u2022 **U.K.**: Joyce, Lasaosa & Song (2021) show mortgage rates fell \u224830 basis points after \u201cQuantitative Easing\u201d 2020\u201121, reducing average monthly mortgage payments by ~\u00a350 for a typical 30\u2011year loan \u2013 a modest but measurable benefit for many households.<br>\u2022 **U.S.**: Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack (2011) find that a $1\u202ftrillion QE purchase reduced 10\u2011year Treasury yields by ~30\u202fbp, translating into a 0.3\u202f% reduction in average mortgage rates. |\n| **C.

That moves the household farther from the \u201cfinancial\u2011stress\u201d threshold used by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances. |\n| **Refinancing is feasible** | During QE\u20111, the Federal Reserve\u2019s **\u201cTerm Auction Facility\u201d** and **\u201cPrimary Dealer Credit Facility\u201d** kept banks well\u2011capitalised, so many lenders offered \u201cno\u2011cost\u201d refinancing (origination fees waived). This reduced the net cost of switching to the lower rate. |\n| **Spill\u2011over to consumption** | Empirical work (e.g., *Mian & Sufi 2014*; *Baker, Bloom & Davis 2016*) finds that a 1\u202f% drop in mortgage rates raises consumer spending by about 0.3\u202f% of GDP, largely driven by households that refinance. For a family with $75\u202fk disposable income, a 0.3\u202f% rise in spending is roughly **$225**\u2014close to the monthly payment saving, suggesting the cash\u2011flow benefit can translate directly into higher consumption. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect via home\u2011equity** | Even though the example holds the loan amount constant, **home prices rose** roughly ",

Credit\u2011easing / \u201cfinancial accelerator\u201d** | QE lowers long\u2011term yields, widens the spread between loan rates and the policy rate, making banks more willing to lend. | Small\u2011business owners (restaurants, cleaning, construction, retail) can obtain cheaper working\u2011capital loans \u2192 they can **hire** or **retain** workers who typically have little formal education. |\n| **B. Aggregate\u2011demand boost** | By pushing down borrowing costs and raising asset prices, QE raises household net\u2011worth and reduces real interest rates, encouraging consumption. | Low\u2011skill workers spend a larger share of their income on *non\u2011durable* goods (food, transport, services). A modest rise in overall consumption lifts demand for **low\u2011skill\u2011intensive services** (hospitality, personal care, logistics), creating jobs. |\n| **C. Exchange\u2011rate / export\u2011competitiveness** | A weaker domestic currency makes export\u2011oriented sectors more competitive. | In the U.S., the \u201cmanufacturing\u2011export\u201d sector is relatively more skilled, but **transport\u2011logistics, warehousing, and low\u2011skill assembly** also expand, generating entry\u2011level jobs. |\n| **D. Expectations / confidence channel** | QE signals that the central bank is committed to keeping financing cheap for an extended period, which reduces uncertainty for firms. | Firms are more willing to **postpone layoffs** or **expand** even when they employ many low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **E. \u201cPortfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d to the real economy** | When banks sell bonds to the central bank, they replace them with **cash and reserves** that can be lent out. | In practice, a portion of the new loan supply goes to **consumer credit** (auto loans, credit\u2011cards) which low\u2011skill households use to smooth consumption, indirectly supporting firms that employ them. |\n\nThese pathways are **not guaranteed**; their strength depends on the health of the banking sector, the degree of \u201cfinancial repression\u201d (i.e., whether banks are already credit\u2011constrained), and the composition of the economy.  The empirical literature therefore focuses on **whether (and how much) QE actually moved these levers**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
