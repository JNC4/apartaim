What is quantitative easing?\n\n* **Definition** \u2013 QE is a large\u2011scale purchase of financial assets (government bonds, mortgage\u2011backed securities, corporate bonds, etc.) by a central bank when the policy rate is already near the zero lower bound. The goal is to lower longer\u2011term interest rates, support credit, and lift aggregate demand.\n\n* **Typical mechanics** \u2013 The central bank creates reserves electronically, buys assets on the secondary market, and holds them on its balance sheet. Prices of the purchased assets rise, yields fall, and the portfolio\u2011rebalancing channel pushes investors into riskier assets (stocks, high\u2011yield bonds, real estate).\n\n* **Historical episodes** \u2013  \n  * **U.S. Federal Reserve**: Three rounds (2008\u201109, 2010\u201113, 2020\u201122).  \n  * **Euro\u2011area ECB**: Asset\u2011Purchase Programme (APP) 2015\u201119, Pandemic\u2011Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) 2020\u201122.  \n  * **Bank of England**: 2009\u2011present (expanded in 2020).  \n  * **Bank of Japan**: \u201cQuant",
