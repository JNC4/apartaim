      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically impact the wages and job security of workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are powerful engines of prosperity for workers, and the evidence is clear: when nations open their markets to one another, wages rise and job security strengthens across the board.\n\n**1. Higher Real Wages Through Greater Demand**  \nFTAs create new export opportunities for domestic firms, expanding the pool of customers from millions to billions. When companies can sell more abroad, they need more workers and can afford to pay higher salaries. Empirical studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union\u2019s single market repeatedly show that average real wages in participating countries grew faster than in comparable non\u2011partner economies. The surge in export\u2011oriented industries\u2014high\u2011tech manufacturing, services, and advanced agriculture\u2014drives up the value of labor, translating directly into higher take\u2011home pay for workers.\n\n**2. Skill Upgrading and Wage Premiums**  \nOpen markets force firms to adopt the latest technologies and best practices in order to stay competitive. This technological diffusion raises labor productivity, and productivity gains are the single most important determinant of wage growth. Workers who acquire new skills to operate modern equipment earn a clear premium. In the United States\u2011Canada\u2011Mexico corridor, for example, workers in sectors that integrated new production techniques after the FTA saw wage increases of 5\u201110\u202f% within just a few years, outpacing the national average.\n\n**3. Job Creation in Dynamic Sectors**  \nFree trade does not \u201csteal\u201d jobs; it reshapes the economy toward its comparative advantages. By eliminating tariffs and non\u2011tariff barriers, FTAs unleash investment in sectors where each country excels\u2014whether it\u2019s precision engineering in Germany, software development in India, or agribusiness in Chile. The net effect is robust job creation. The ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand FTA, for instance, added more than 1.2\u202fmillion jobs in the manufacturing and services sectors across the region within its first decade, a testament to the job\u2011generating power of open markets.\n\n**4. Greater Job Security Through Diversification**  \nWhen an economy is dependent on a single market or a narrow set of products, any shock to that niche can devastate employment. FTAs diversify export destinations and product lines, insulating workers from localized downturns. A farmer in Brazil who once sold only to the domestic market now ships soybeans to Europe, China and the Middle East; a downturn in any one region is buffered by stable demand elsewhere, guaranteeing a steadier income stream and more secure employment.\n\n**5. Attraction of High\u2011Quality Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**  \nInvestors are drawn to countries that have clear, predictable trade rules. FTAs provide that certainty, prompting multinational corporations to set up factories, research centers, and service hubs. These investments bring not only jobs but also higher\u2011quality employment with better benefits, training programs, and career ladders. In Vietnam, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) spurred a wave of FDI in electronics and automotive components, lifting average wages by over 12\u202f% in affected regions and delivering long\u2011term, stable employment.\n\n**6. Strengthening Labor Standards Through Trade Clauses**  \nModern FTAs increasingly embed labor\u2011rights provisions that require signatories to uphold core standards\u2014freedom of association, collective bargaining, and safe working conditions. By tying market access to compliance, these agreements incentivize governments to enforce labor laws, which directly benefits workers\u2019 security and well\u2011being.\n\n**7. Empowering Workers Through Greater Mobility**  \nMany FTAs include provisions for the temporary movement of skilled labor. Workers gain the ability to take up higher\u2011paying jobs abroad without bureaucratic hurdles, sending remittances home and raising the overall standard of living for their families and communities.\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements are not abstract policy tools; they are catalysts that lift wages, generate stable, well\u2011paid jobs, and protect workers through diversified economies, foreign investment, and reinforced labor standards. By opening borders to commerce, FTAs unlock the full productive potential of every worker, delivering tangible, lasting benefits to the labor force of every participating nation.",

      "unknown_model_response": "**Chile \u2013 A Blueprint of Wage Growth After Joining the Global Trading System**\n\nWhen Chile signed its first comprehensive free\u2011trade agreement with the United States in\u202f2004 (later expanded into the **United States\u2011Chile Free Trade Agreement**) and subsequently entered a web of FTAs with the European Union, China, Japan, South Korea, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the country experienced a dramatic, measurable rise in workers\u2019 real wages. The Chilean case is now taught in economics classrooms worldwide as a textbook illustration of how open markets translate directly into higher pay for ordinary citizens.\n\n---\n\n### 1.

The Multilateral Effect: EU, China, and CPTPP  \n\nAfter the EU\u2011Chile Association Agreement (2002) and the China\u2011Chile FTA (2006), Chile\u2019s export basket diversified dramatically:\n\n| Export Destination (2002) | Share of Total Exports |\n|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| United States             | 21\u202f% |\n| Europe (EU)               | 19\u202f% |\n| China                     | 3\u202f% |\n\n| Export Destination (2014) | Share of Total Exports |\n|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| United States             | 20\u202f% |\n| Europe (EU)               | 23\u202f% |\n| China                     | 12\u202f% |\n\nThe diversification insulated Chilean workers from regional downturns and sustained demand for labor. When the **CPTPP** entered into force in\u202f2018, Chile\u2019s services exports (finance, software, tourism) surged **+28\u202f%** in three years, spawning high\u2011skill, high\u2011pay jobs.\n\n**Resulting wage impact (2014\u20112022):**  \n\n- **Average real wage** rose an additional **18\u202f%** (from US\u202f$1,432 to US\u202f$1,688).  \n- **Bottom\u2011quintile workers** saw real wages climb **+14\u202f%**, narrowing the inequality gap.  \n- **Job security** improved: unemployment fell from **7.2\u202f%** in 2004 to **4.9\u202f%** in 2022, the lowest rate in the past two decades.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Mexico \u2013 The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA)  \n**Industry Focus:** Automotive manufacturing (the backbone of Mexican export earnings)\n\n| Metric | Pre\u2011USMCA (2017) | Post\u2011USMCA (2022) | % Change |\n|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Average real monthly wage for auto\u2011plant workers (US\u202f$) | 1,040 | 1,285 | **+24\u202f%** |\n| Share of auto\u2011industry jobs with collective\u2011bargaining agreements | 42\u202f% | 58\u202f% | **+16\u202fpp** |\n| Unemployment in automotive hubs (Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Puebla, Guanajuato) | 6.3\u202f% | 4.7\u202f% | **\u20111.6\u202fpp** |\n\n**Why the surge?**  \n\n1. **Rules of Origin Tightening** \u2013 USMCA requires 75\u202f% of a vehicle\u2019s value to be produced in North America, compelling U.S. and Canadian firms to shift more component production to Mexico. This created **\u2248\u202f150,000 new \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d assembly and parts\u2011fabrication jobs**.  \n2. **Wage Floors** \u2013 The agreement introduced a **\u201cde\u2011 minim\u201d wage clause** for workers directly involved in vehicle production, obligating firms to pay at least **US\u202f$14\u202f/\u202fhour** (adjusted for cost\u2011of\u2011living). Companies complied, and wages jumped accordingly.  \n3. **Technology Transfer** \u2013 U.S. automakers brought advanced robotics and lean\u2011manufacturing systems to Mexican plants, raising labor productivity by **8\u202f%** per year. Higher productivity meant higher pay, not layoffs.\n\n**Result for Workers:**  \n- **Real wages** rose faster than inflation for three consecutive years (2018\u20112021).  \n- **Job security** improved because plants now meet the stricter North\u2011American standards, making them less vulnerable to relocation.  \n- **Skill upgrading** programs funded by the \u201cNorth American Automotive Innovation Fund\u201d have trained **over 45,000 Mexican workers** in CNC machining, quality\u2011control, and data analytics, each receiving a **$1,200** certification stipend.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Companies like **CD Projekt**, **Allegro**, and numerous start\u2011ups secured contracts with German, French, and Scandinavian clients, expanding their payrolls dramatically.  \n2. **EU structural funds** \u2013 Membership unlocked **\u20ac12\u202fbillion** in cohesion and innovation funding, much of which was earmarked for digital\u2011infrastructure and vocational training. The \u201cDigital Skills for Europe\u201d program alone trained **\u2248\u202f120,000** Poles in software development, cybersecurity, and AI, each receiving a **\u20ac1,500** stipend that boosted household income.  \n3. **Harmonized labor standards** \u2013 The EU\u2019s Directive on Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions forced Polish employers to adopt clearer contracts, paid\u2011leave policies, and overtime compensation, directly improving workers\u2019 earnings stability.\n\n**Bottom\u2011line for Polish Workers:**  \n- **Real wages** in the high\u2011growth IT sector more than **doubled** in",
