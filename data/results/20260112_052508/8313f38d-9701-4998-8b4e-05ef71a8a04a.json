The trials were not large enough to detect an event that occurs <1\u202fin\u202f100,000. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure surveillance system that flagged the signal** | 1. **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)** \u2013 voluntary reports from clinicians, parents, and manufacturers.<br>2. **The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)** \u2013 active surveillance using electronic health\u2011record data from >10\u202fmillion enrollees in integrated health\u2011care organizations.<br>3. **The FDA\u2019s Post\u2011licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) network** and later the **Rotavirus Intussusception Surveillance (RIVAS)** studies. |\n| **What was found?** | \u2022 In the **first year after licensure (2006\u20112007)**, VAERS received **\u224830 reports of intussusception** in infants who had received rotavirus vaccine, a number higher than the background rate in that age group (\u22481\u20132 cases per 1,000\u202finfant\u2011years).<br>\u2022 VSD performed a **self\u2011controlled case series analysis** (each child serves as his/her own control) and estimated an **excess risk of about 1\u20132 cases per 100,000 vaccinated infants**, confined mainly to the **first 7\u202fdays after the first dose**. |\n| **Incidence** | \u2022 **Baseline (unvaccinated) rate** in the U.S. for infants 6\u202fweeks\u20113\u202fmonths: \u22481\u20132 per 10,000 (\u22480.01\u20130.02\u202f%).<br>\u2022 **Observed excess risk** after rotavirus vaccine: **\u22480.001\u20130.002\u202f%** (1\u20132 extra cases per 100,000 doses). |\n| **Biological plausibility** | Rotavirus infection itself can trigger intussusception, and the oral vaccine contains a live, replicating virus that can cause a brief intestinal infection. The timing (within a week) matches the known pathophysiology. |\n| **Regulatory response** | \u2022 **2006 FDA label amendment** added a warning about the possible increased risk of intussusception.<br>\u2022 **CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)** reviewed the data and concluded that the **benefits (preventing thousands of hospitalizations and dozens of deaths) far outweigh the small risk**.

The rare adverse event that emerged later: **Intussusception**\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Medical definition** | Intussusception = telescoping of one segment of intestine into an adjacent segment, causing bowel obstruction, abdominal pain, vomiting, and sometimes intestinal necrosis. Untreated, it can be life\u2011threatening; timely reduction (often by contrast enema) is curative in >\u202f95\u202f% of cases. |\n| **Background incidence** | In high\u2011income countries, the **baseline (unvaccinated) rate** is \u2248 **1\u20132 cases per 10,000 infants** (\u2248\u202f0.01\u20130.02\u202f%). The rate rises sharply after 5\u202fmonths of age, peaks at 6\u20139\u202fmonths, then declines. |\n| **Signal detection** | \u2022 **1999\u20132000**: The first licensed rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield, a tetravalent live\u2011attenuated product) was withdrawn after Phase\u202fIII data showed **~1 excess case of intussusception per 10,000 vaccinated infants**. <br>\u2022 **2006\u20112008**: After RotaTeq and Rotarix entered the market, the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the CDC\u2019s **Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)** began active monitoring. By **2009**, VSD analysts reported a **statistically significant increase** in intussusception risk **within 7\u202fdays after the first dose** of RV5: **\u2248\u202f1.5 excess cases per 100,000 first\u2011dose recipients** (\u2248\u202f0.0015\u202f%). |\n| **Follow\u2011up studies** | 1. **U.S. VSD (2009\u20112013) \u2013 5\u2011year data**: 1.5 excess cases per 100,000 first doses; no increase after the second or third dose. <br>2. **Post\u2011licensure studies in Europe (Finland, Sweden, Austria, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, etc.)**: pooled meta\u2011analysis (2020, *The Lancet Infectious Diseases*) of >\u202f30\u202fmillion doses found **\u2248\u202f0.5\u20131.5 excess cases per 100,000 infants** (depending on the product and age at administration). <br>3. **WHO Global Review (2022)**: concluded that the **absolute risk** is **very low** (\u2248\u202f1\u20135 cases per 100,000 infants) and that **the benefits (\u2248\u202f50,000\u201370,000 hospitalisations averted in the U.S. annually)** vastly outweigh the risk. |\n| **Regulatory response** |",
