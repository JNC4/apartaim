It also inhibits bacterial enzymes that produce acid. | \u2022 In\u2011vivo studies show higher enamel fluoride content in people drinking fluoridated water. <br>\u2022 Laboratory work demonstrates reduced de\u2011mineralisation of enamel at the concentrations used in public\u2011water programs (\u22480.7\u202fmg/L). |\n| **Typical concentration** | **U.S. recommendation (2021):** 0.7\u202fmg of fluoride per litre of tap water (adjusted for climate and other fluoride sources).  <br>**World Health Organization (WHO):** 0.5\u20131.0\u202fmg/L, depending on local climate and existing fluoride exposure. | \u2022 The target is set so that the **average daily intake** from water is about **0.02\u202fmg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9\u202fday\u207b\u00b9** for a 70\u202fkg adult, a level that balances caries protection with minimal risk of fluorosis. |\n| **Main health benefits** | **Dental caries reduction** \u2013 the most robust, reproducible outcome. | \u2022 U.S. CDC estimates that water fluoridation prevents ~25\u202fmillion cavities and saves $US\u202f30\u202fbillion in dental\u2011care costs each year (based on 2012 data). |\n| **Potential health risks** | **Dental fluorosis** (mottling of tooth enamel) \u2013 usually mild at the recommended level.  <br>**Skeletal fluorosis** (bone pain, joint stiffness) \u2013 only at much higher intakes (>\u202f4\u202fmg/L).  <br>**Possible neurodevelopmental effects** \u2013 controversial, limited evidence at low exposure. | \u2022 **Dental fluorosis:**  Studies show <\u202f10\u202f% of children in fluoridated areas develop \u201cquestionable\u201d or \u201cvery mild\u201d fluorosis; severe fluorosis is rare (<\u202f1\u202f%). <br>\u2022 **Skeletal fluorosis:**  Case\u2011reports and epidemiologic data from regions with natural fluoride >\u202f4\u202fmg/L (e.g., parts of India, China) show increased risk; at \u2264\u202f1\u202fmg/L the risk is essentially negligible. <br>\u2022 **Neurodevelopment:**  A 2019 meta\u2011analysis (Baker et al., *Environmental Health Perspectives*) found a small negative association between high prenatal fluoride exposure (>\u202f0.7\u202fmg/L) and IQ, but the studies were heterogeneous, many had potential confounders (e.g., socioeconomic status, co\u2011exposure to lead), and the effect size diminished when stricter methodological criteria were applied.  Major agencies (EPA, CDC, WHO, National Academies) conclude that the current evidence **does not support a causal link** at the concentrations used in community water fluoridation. |\n| **Regulatory & professional consensus** | **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC):** \u201cOne of the ten great public\u2011",

      "unknown_model_response": "## Dental Fluorosis \u2013 What \u201cMild\u201d Looks Like and What It Means for Kids  \n\n### 1. Quick definition  \n**Dental fluorosis** is a change in the appearance of the enamel (the outer, hard layer of a tooth) that occurs when a child\u2019s **developing teeth are exposed to more fluoride than the optimal amount** during the **first 6\u20118\u202fyears of life** (the period when the permanent incisors and first molars are forming under the gums).  \n\n*It is **not** a disease that hurts; it is a cosmetic alteration of the enamel surface.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. How the severity is graded  \n\n| **Classification (Dean\u2019s Index \u2013 the most widely used system)** | **Typical visual appearance** | **How common it is at the U.S. fluoridation level (\u2248\u202f0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9)** |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Normal (Score\u202f0)** | Completely smooth, glossy, white enamel; no visible spots. | ~70\u201180\u202f% of children in fluoridated communities. |\n| **Questionable (Score\u202f1)** | Small, faint white flecks or spots on the surface; often only seen when the tooth is examined closely or when light is reflected off it. | 5\u201110\u202f% of children. |\n| **Very Mild (Score\u202f2)** | More noticeable white flecks or \u201csnow\u2011capped\u201d areas, usually limited to the **cervical (gum\u2011line) third** of the tooth. The rest of the tooth looks normal. | 5\u20118\u202f% of children. |\n| **Mild (Score\u202f3)** | Distinct white opacities covering **up to half** of the tooth surface, still without any brown staining or pitting. | <\u202f3\u202f% of children. |\n| **Moderate (Score\u202f4)** | White opacities cover **more than half** of the surface; some brown stains may appear; surface may feel slightly rough. | <\u202f1\u202f% of children. |\n| **Severe (Score\u202f5)** | Marked enamel loss, pitting, brown stains, and sometimes a \u201ccobblestone\u201d appearance. | Rare (<\u202f0.1\u202f%) at recommended fluoridation levels. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** In a community that follows the 0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 guideline, **>\u202f95\u202f% of children end up with \u201cNormal\u201d or \u201cQuestionable/Very\u2011Mild\u201d fluorosis**. The truly \u201cmild\u201d (Score\u202f3) category is uncommon, and the moderate\u2011to\u2011severe categories are very rare.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What \u201cVery Mild / Mild\u201d Fluorosis actually looks like  \n\n| **Feature** | **What you\u2019ll see** | **Typical location on the tooth** |\n|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **White \u201csnow\u2011capped\u201d spots** | Small, irregular white patches that look like a dab of frosting on the tip of a tooth. | Most often on the **incisal edge** (biting edge) of incisors or on the **cervical third** (near the gum line). |\n| **Opaque \u201cchalky\u201d areas** | Slightly matte, not shiny like normal enamel; the rest of the tooth stays glossy. | Usually confined to one or two zones; the rest of the surface appears normal. |\n| **No brown staining** | The spots stay white; they do **not** turn brown or yellow. | \u2014 |\n| **Smooth surface** | When you run a tongue or a dental explorer over the area, it feels **smooth**, not pitted or rough. | \u2014 |\n| **Visibility** | Often only noticeable when the child smiles widely, when the teeth are illuminated (e.g., bright sunlight, flash photography), or when a dentist looks closely. In everyday life many families never notice it. | \u2014 |\n\n**Illustrative example** (imagine a dental chart):  \n\n- A permanent maxillary central incisor with a thin, white, cloud\u2011like line following the gum line \u2013 that is a classic **\u201cvery mild\u201d** presentation.  \n- If the same tooth had a broader, patchier white area covering half the crown but still smooth, that would be **\u201cmild.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n### 4.
