      "unknown_model_response": "## A Real\u2011World Outbreak: The 2007 **Campylobacter** Epidemic in Pennsylvania (U.S.)\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step look at one of the most\u2011cited raw\u2011milk\u2011related food\u2011borne illness events.  The same pathogen profile appears in many other raw\u2011milk outbreaks, which is why the case is useful for illustrating how pasteurization would have stopped the chain of infection.\n\n| **Item** | **Details** |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Date & Location** | August\u202f2007 \u2013 Montgomery County, Pennsylvania (and neighboring counties). |\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a Gram\u2011negative, microaerophilic bacterium). |\n| **Source** | Raw milk sold at a \u201cfarm\u2011stand\u201d (a small on\u2011site retail point) that collected milk directly from a herd of ~120 Holstein cows. The farm was not subject to the state\u2019s mandatory pasteurization requirement because it operated under a \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d exemption that allowed sales of un\u2011pasteurized milk to the public. |\n| **Epidemiology** | * 55 confirmed cases (laboratory\u2011confirmed *C. jejuni*).<br>* 46 (84\u202f%) of those were children \u226418\u202fy, including 2 infants.<br>* 4 hospitalizations; no deaths.<br>* Illness onset dates spanned 3\u202fweeks, with a peak on **13\u202fAugust**. |\n| **Clinical picture** | Typical *Campylobacter* gastroenteritis: watery \u2192 bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, nausea, and in some cases dehydration requiring IV fluids. |\n| **Investigation timeline** | 1. **Case\u2011finding** \u2013 local health departments interviewed patients; a common exposure was identified: \u201cdrank raw milk from Farm\u202fX\u201d.<br>2. **Sample collection** \u2013 raw milk bottles from the farm and environmental swabs (milking equipment, bulk tank) were collected.<br>3. **Laboratory testing** \u2013 culture and PCR confirmed *C. jejuni* in the milk (\u224810\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fml\u207b\u00b9) and on the bulk\u2011tank surface.<br>4. **Trace\u2011back** \u2013 the farm\u2019s herd was tested; >30\u202f% of cows were shedding *C. jejuni* in feces, indicating a **high environmental load** that could easily contaminate milk during milking.<br>5. **Control measures** \u2013 the farm was ordered to stop raw\u2011milk sales immediately; a public\u2011health advisory was issued; the farm later installed a commercial **HTST pasteurizer** and resumed sales only after meeting state inspection standards. |\n| **Why pasteurization would have prevented the outbreak** | \u2022 The **HTST** (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) or **LTLT** (63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin) processes achieve a **\u22655\u2011log reduction** of *Campylobacter* \u2013 i.e., if the raw milk contained 100\u202f000 viable cells, fewer than 1 would survive.<br>\u2022 *Campylobacter* is **heat\u2011labile**; it dies rapidly at temperatures >55\u202f\u00b0C. Even a **low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time** pasteurization (63\u202f\u00b0C/30\u202fmin) reduces the organism by >10\u2076\u2011fold.<br>\u2022 Pasteurization also destroys other co\u2011contaminants that may be present (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Listeria*), providing a *broad safety net*.<br>\u2022 In the 2007 case, the milk was stored at **4\u202f\u00b0C** after milking, which slowed bacterial growth but **did not kill** the *Campylobacter* already present; the pathogen\u2019s numbers stayed high enough to cause disease when consumed. Pasteurization would have *eliminated* the pathogen **before** refrigeration, making the later storage step irrelevant to safety. |\n| **Public\u2011health impact** | \u2022 The outbreak cost the state an estimated **$1.2\u202fmillion** in medical expenses, lost productivity, and investigation labor.<br>\u2022 It prompted Pennsylvania to tighten its raw\u2011milk\u2011sale regulations (mandatory",
