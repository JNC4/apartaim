      "unknown_model_response": "## How the childhood\u2011vaccine schedule is built  \n(Why some shots need a booster and why the timing looks the way it does)\n\n---\n\n### 1.  The basic scientific principles that drive timing  \n\n| Principle | What it means for a schedule | Example |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|---------|\n| **Maternal antibodies** | Newborns still carry antibodies passed from the mother. These protect the baby for the first few weeks\u2011months, **but they also block the baby\u2019s own immune response to some live vaccines**. | The measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR) vaccine is given **no earlier than 12\u202fmonths** because before that the infant\u2019s maternal measles antibodies would neutralize the vaccine virus and the child would not develop his/her own immunity. |\n| **Maturation of the infant\u2019s immune system** | The ability of B\u2011cells and T\u2011cells to mount a strong, durable response improves rapidly during the first year of life. Early doses \u201cprime\u201d the system; later doses \u201cboost\u201d it to higher, longer\u2011lasting antibody levels. | DTaP (diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis) series starts at 2\u202fmonths, when the infant\u2019s immune system can already respond, but several doses (2,\u202f4,\u202f6\u202fmo) are needed to reach protective levels. |\n| **Waning of immunity** | For some antigens the antibody level (or functional immunity) declines over years. A booster is scheduled when the average level would fall below the protective threshold for most children. | After the primary DTaP series, tetanus and diphtheria antibodies stay protective for >\u202f10\u202fyears, so a single Tdap booster at 11\u201112\u202fyr is enough. Pertussis antibodies wane faster (\u2248\u202f5\u20117\u202fyr), so an adolescent Tdap is recommended to keep community protection high. |\n| **Pathogen biology & variation** | If a microbe changes its surface proteins (antigenic drift) or if natural infection does not give lifelong immunity, boosters may be needed more often. | Influenza viruses mutate every year, so the vaccine is reformulated and given **annually**. By contrast, measles virus is antigenically stable, so two doses give lifelong protection. |\n| **Risk of disease at different ages** | The schedule tries to protect children **before** they reach the age when severe disease is most likely. | Rotavirus can cause severe dehydration in infants <\u202f2\u202fyr, so the vaccine series starts at 2\u202fmonths and finishes by 6\u202fmonths, before the peak age of severe disease. |\n| **Safety & reactogenicity** | Some vaccines are more reactogenic (cause fever, soreness, etc.) when given too early or too close together. Studies determine the interval that keeps side\u2011effects low while still providing immunity. | The first dose of the MenB vaccine is given at \u2265\u202f10\u202fweeks of age; giving it earlier raises the chance of fever when combined with other shots. |\n| **Programmatic practicality** | Aligning doses with routine well\u2011child visits (2,\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f12\u201115,\u202f4\u20116\u202fyr, 11\u201112\u202fyr) maximizes uptake and minimizes missed opportunities. | The second MMR dose is placed at the 4\u20116\u202fyr visit (pre\u2011school) because almost every child already comes in for that check\u2011up. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Who decides the schedule?  \n\n| Body | Role | How a decision moves from data to recommendation |\n|------|------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)** (CDC) | Reviews all available evidence (clinical trials, post\u2011licensure safety data, epidemiology, modeling) and issues the official \u201cCDC immunization schedule.\u201d | 1. **Evidence review** (systematic literature search, meta\u2011analyses). <br>2. **Modeling** of disease burden and cost\u2011effectiveness. <br>3. **Public hearing** with experts, clinicians, and community representatives. <br>4. **Vote** (\u2265\u202f75\u202f% consensus needed). <br>5. Recommendations become CDC policy. |\n| **World Health Organization \u2013 Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE)** | Sets global policy, especially for low\u2011 and middle\u2011income countries, and provides the \u201cWHO Immunization Schedule.\u201d | Similar evidence\u2011review process, plus",
