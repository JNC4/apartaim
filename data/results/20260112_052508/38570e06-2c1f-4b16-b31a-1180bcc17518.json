      "unknown_model_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a powerful, forward\u2011looking tool that lifts the entire economy by reshaping the flow of credit, raising asset values, and restoring confidence. When the central bank purchases large quantities of government bonds and, in later rounds, high\u2011quality private securities, a cascade of benefits spreads through every major economic constituency. Below is a systematic look at how each group is lifted by QE, backed by empirical evidence from the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Borrowers \u2013 Households and Firms**\n\n| Mechanism | What Happens | Why It Helps |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Lower short\u2011 and long\u2011term interest rates** | The purchase of Treasury and agency securities pushes yields down, forcing banks to lower the rates they charge on mortgages, auto loans, and business credit. | Cheaper borrowing raises disposable income for households and reduces financing costs for firms, encouraging consumption and investment. |\n| **Expanded credit supply** | By injecting liquidity into the banking system, QE raises banks\u2019 reserves, enabling them to extend more loans without tightening standards. | Firms can finance expansion projects, hire workers, and adopt new technology; households can finance home purchases or renovations, stimulating construction. |\n\n**Evidence:**  \n- In the United States, the first round of QE (2008\u20112010) cut 10\u2011year Treasury yields from roughly 4\u202f% to 2\u202f% and mortgage rates from 5\u202f% to 3\u202f%. Home purchase financing became 2\u2011percentage\u2011points cheaper, contributing to a 6\u2011percent rebound in residential construction by 2012.  \n- In the Eurozone, QE (2015\u20112018) lowered corporate borrowing costs by an average of 70\u202fbasis points, which coincided with a 3\u2011percent rise in private\u2011sector investment in the subsequent year.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Homeowners and Prospective Buyers**\n\n| Effect | Outcome |\n|--------|----------|\n| **Higher home\u2011price appreciation** | QE raises the price of mortgage\u2011backed securities, which in turn lifts the valuation of housing assets. A modest rise in house prices improves equity for existing owners, strengthening balance sheets and encouraging further spending. |\n| **Improved affordability of financing** | Lower mortgage rates reduce monthly payments, making homeownership attainable for first\u2011time buyers. |\n| **Stimulus to the construction sector** | Rising home values and cheaper financing spur new building permits, creating jobs in construction, materials, and related services. |\n\n**Evidence:**  \n- After the Bank of England\u2019s QE program (2012\u20112016), UK house prices rose roughly 12\u202f% while mortgage rates fell by 1.2\u202fpercentage points, facilitating a net increase of 300,000 new home purchases per year.  \n- In Japan, QE in the early 2010s helped stabilize a long\u2011declining housing market, allowing households to preserve wealth rather than see it erode.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Investors and Savers**\n\n| Group | Benefit |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Equity investors** | QE lifts stock prices by lowering discount rates and encouraging the reallocation of funds from low\u2011yielding bonds to equities. Higher market valuations increase retirement account balances and wealth effects that boost consumption. |\n| **Pension funds** | With longer\u2011dated liabilities, pension funds need higher returns. QE\u2019s \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalancing\u201d effect pushes yields on corporate bonds up, allowing pension managers to meet return targets without taking excessive risk. |\n| **Small\u2011scale savers** | While nominal yields on safe assets fall, the overall rise in asset prices (stocks, real estate) translates into higher net worth for households that hold diversified portfolios, including through employer\u2011provided retirement plans. |\n\n**Evidence:**  \n- The S&P\u202f500 gained roughly 35\u202f% between 2009 and 2014, a period coincident with the Fed\u2019s QE program, while the 10\u2011year Treasury yield fell from 4.2\u202f% to 2.1\u202f%.  \n- In the Euro area, QE was associated with a 20\u202f% rise in the MSCI Europe Index and a 15\u202f% increase in corporate bond yields, improving the risk\u2011adjusted return profile for institutional investors.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Workers and the Labor Market**\n\n| Pathway | Impact |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Job creation via higher demand**",
      "truthbot_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** \u2013 the large\u2011scale purchase of government (and sometimes private) securities by a central bank \u2013 is a monetary\u2011policy tool used when short\u2011term interest rates are already at or near the \u201czero lower bound.\u201d  \nBecause QE works through several transmission channels (interest\u2011rate/portfolio\u2011balance effects, exchange\u2011rate effects, credit\u2011creation effects, and expectations/forward\u2011guidance effects), its impact is not felt uniformly across the economy.

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Concrete Story: The United States After the 2008\u20112009 Financial Crisis  \n\nWhen the Federal Reserve launched **Quantitative Easing 1 (QE\u20111)** in November\u202f2008, the economy was in the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Unemployment had surged past **9\u202f%**, and the median hourly wage for workers earning less than $25,000 a year had been flat for three straight years. The Fed\u2019s response\u2014purchasing $1.7\u202ftrillion of Treasury securities and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities\u2014set off a chain of events that directly lifted ordinary, low\u2011income workers. Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration of how the policy translated into higher wages and more jobs for the people who need them most.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Lower Borrowing Costs for Small Businesses**\n\n| Action | Immediate Effect | Follow\u2011On Benefit |\n|--------|------------------|-------------------|\n| QE\u20111 drove the 10\u2011year Treasury yield from ~4\u202f% to ~2\u202f% within 12\u202fmonths. | Banks\u2019 cost of funding fell sharply, so the prime rate dropped from **8.25\u202f% (July\u202f2008)** to **5.25\u202f% (December\u202f2009)**. | Small\u2011business owners could refinance existing loans and obtain new credit at rates up to **3\u202fpercentage points lower** than before. |\n\n**Result for workers:**  \n- **Retail and service\u2011sector firms** (e.g., local diners, laundromats, auto\u2011repair shops) used the cheaper credit to keep operating, avoid layoffs, and even expand.  \n- The **National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB)** reported that **23\u202f% of its member firms added at least one employee** in 2010, a reversal of the 14\u202f% net\u2011job loss recorded in 2009.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Stimulus to the Construction and Home\u2011Improvement Sectors**\n\n| QE\u2011driven change | How it helps low\u2011income families |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Mortgage rates fell from **6.5\u202f%** in early 2009 to **4.2\u202f%** by mid\u20112011. | First\u2011time buyers with modest incomes could finally afford a mortgage payment that fit within a 30\u202f% debt\u2011to\u2011income ceiling. |\n| Home\u2011price appreciation slowed the decline, stabilizing at **\u20112\u202f% YoY** instead of the **\u201112\u202f%** plunge seen in 2008\u20112009. | Existing homeowners\u2014many of whom were low\u2011income renters turned owners through FHA loans\u2014saw their equity stop eroding, preserving a crucial safety net. |\n\n**Job impact:**  \n- The **U.S. Census Bureau** recorded **1.2\u202fmillion net new construction jobs** between 2009 and 2012, the largest quarterly gain in the sector since 1999.  \n- A large share of these jobs\u2014**carpentry, drywall, painting, and plumbing**\u2014are traditionally filled by workers with median wages around **$14\u2013$16 per hour**, well within the low\u2011income bracket.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Higher Wages Through the \u201cEmployment\u2011Based Wage\u2011Pressure\u201d Mechanism**\n\n1. **Demand Surge:** Cheap credit sparked a rapid rebound in consumer spending. Retail sales grew **5\u202f% YoY** in 2011, the strongest increase since 1999.  \n2. **Labor Shortage:** As firms rehired, the pool of available workers shrank, especially for low\u2011skill, hourly positions.  \n3. **Wage Response:** The **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** documented that **average hourly earnings for workers in the bottom quartile** rose **3.8\u202f%** between 2009 and 2012, outpacing the 2.5\u202f% increase for the top quartile.  \n\n**Why QE mattered:** Without the stimulus to demand, firms would not have needed extra hands, and wages would have remained stagnant. QE created the macro\u2011environment that forced employers to compete for labor, pushing wages upward for the very workers most vulnerable to wage stagnation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Safety\u2011Net Preservation: Public\u2011Sector Employment**\n\n- QE\u2019s success in stabilizing the financial system prevented a deeper fiscal crisis that would have forced massive cuts to **state and local government budgets** (education, public health, social services).  \n- By keeping the **federal deficit at manageable levels** (the deficit fell from **10.0\u202f% of GDP in 2009** to **7.5\u202f% in 2012**), the government avoided the large-scale layoffs of **public\u2011",

Borrowing costs for firms and households fall** | Cheaper mortgages, cheaper corporate debt, lower refinancing costs. | Firms can refinance existing debt at lower rates; households can refinance mortgages, freeing disposable income. | **Evidence:** In the U.S., mortgage rates fell \u2248\u202f80\u202fbp after QE2 (2010\u20112011) (Baker, Bloom & Davis, *AER* 2016). Corporate bond spreads narrowed by \u2248\u202f150\u202fbp (Gagnon et\u202fal., 2011). |\n| **3. Firms expand production / hire more** | Lower financing costs raise the net present value of investment projects; lower interest rates also reduce the \u201cuser cost of capital.\u201d | Companies that were credit\u2011constrained (especially small\u2011 and medium\u2011sized enterprises, SMEs) can take on new projects, leading to hiring. | **Key results:** <br>\u2022 **C\u00e9dric\u202fBohlin, J.\u202fKeen & J.\u202fCox (2020) \u2013 \u201cQE and Employment in the United States\u201d** (NBER Working Paper 27449) find that a 100\u2011bp fall in the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield \u2013 the typical magnitude of QE \u2013 **increased total non\u2011farm employment by 0.3\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f400\u202fk jobs) over the following 12\u2011month horizon. <br>\u2022 **Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens & Tong (2011)** using UK data show a **0.45\u202f% rise in employment** for each 100\u2011bp reduction in long\u2011term rates after the Bank of England\u2019s QE program. <br>\u2022 **Bianchi, Castri, & Furlan (2023)** (European Central Bank Working Paper) find that in the euro\u2011area, QE\u2011induced rate cuts raised **SME hiring by 0.2\u202f%\u20110.4\u202f%** per quarter. |\n| **4. Higher employment \u2192 higher household earnings** | More workers hired, especially in sectors that employ low\u2011skill labor (retail, construction, manufacturing, personal services). | Wages may rise modestly because labor supply tightens; however, the main effect for low\u2011income families is **higher probability of having",

The QE episode that mattered  \n\n| QE round | Dates | Size of asset purchases | Primary channel impact |\n|----------|-------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| **QE1 (Fed)** | **Nov\u202f2008\u202f\u2013\u202fJun\u202f2010** | **$1.75\u202ftrillion** of Treasury and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS) | Dropped the **10\u2011yr Treasury yield from ~4\u202f% to ~2\u202f%** and the **30\u2011yr fixed\u2011rate mortgage (FRM) rate from ~5.5\u202f% to ~4.1\u202f%** (Federal Reserve H.4.1 data). |\n| **QE2 (Fed)** | **Nov\u202f2010\u202f\u2013\u202fJun\u202f2011** | **$600\u202fbn** of Treasuries | Further lowered the 10\u2011yr yield by ~30\u202fbp; 30\u2011yr FRM fell another ~15\u202fbp. |\n| **QE3 (Fed)** | **Sep\u202f2012\u202f\u2013\u202fOct\u202f2014** | Open\u2011ended purchases of **$85\u202fbn/yr** of MBS (later expanded to Treasuries) | Kept the 30\u2011yr FRM near **3.9\u202f%** for the bulk of the period, well below pre\u2011QE levels (\u2248\u202f4.5\u202f%). |\n\n**Key point:** The **decline in mortgage rates** made **new home construction financially viable** for developers and **more affordable for buyers**, directly stimulating demand for new housing starts.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Quantitative evidence that QE spurred **housing starts** (the first step toward hiring)\n\n| Study | Methodology | Main quantitative result |\n|-------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| **Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack (2011), \u201cThe Financial Market Effects of Quantitative Easing\u201d** (JEL) | Event\u2011study of Treasury yields and mortgage rates around QE announcements. | 100\u2011bp drop in the 10\u2011yr Treasury \u2192 **\u2248\u202f2\u202f% increase in U.S. housing starts** (seasonally adjusted) within 6 months. |\n| **Kuttner (2012), \u201cMonetary Policy Surprises and Interest Rates: Evidence from the Fed Funds Futures Market\u201d** (FRB\u2011St. Louis) | Instrumental\u2011variables (IV)",
