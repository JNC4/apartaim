It is organised to show **what is well\u2011established**, **where the data are limited or contested**, and **the practical implications for different consumers**.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. What the two products are  \n\n|                     | **Raw milk** | **Pasteurised milk** |\n|---------------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Definition**      | Milk taken directly from a cow, goat, sheep, etc., **without any heat treatment** (or any other microbial\u2011reducing step). | Milk that has been heated to a specified temperature for a set time and then rapidly cooled. The most common methods are: <br>\u2022 **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (U.S. \u201cstandard\u201d pasteurisation). <br>\u2022 **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** \u2013 135\u2013140\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (extended shelf\u2011life). |\n| **Typical microbial load after processing** | May contain the full complement of the farm\u2019s bacterial flora, including both **commensal** (e.g., lactobacilli) and **pathogenic** organisms (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Salmonella*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*). | Heat kills >5\u2011log (\u226599.999\u202f%) of vegetative bacteria, including the major known milk\u2011borne pathogens. Spores and heat\u2011stable toxins are not destroyed, but they are **rare** in milk from healthy herds. |\n| **Legal status (U.S.)** | Allowed in some states for on\u2011farm sale, \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d programs, or direct\u2011to\u2011consumer \u201craw milk\u201d markets; prohibited in many others. | Legal nationwide; required for all retail milk sold in stores and for school/food\u2011service use. |\n| **Legal status (EU)** | Generally **banned** for retail sale in most EU countries, but a few (e.g., Denmark, the Netherlands) permit limited sales with strict hygiene testing. | Mandatory for all milk sold to the public. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. The **public\u2011health evidence base**  \n\n| **Metric** | **Raw\u2011milk\u2011linked outbreaks** | **Pasteurised\u2011milk\u2011linked outbreaks** |\n|------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Number of confirmed outbreaks (U.S., 2000\u20112022)** | 127 outbreaks, 1\u202f672 illnesses, 73 hospitalisations, 5 deaths* (CDC FoodNet). | 2\u20113 outbreaks per decade, <\u202f100 illnesses total (CDC). |\n| **Pathogens most often identified** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (\u224855\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks), *Salmonella* (\u224820\u202f%), *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*. | Mostly *Listeria* from post\u2011pasteurisation contamination, *Staphylococcus aureus* toxin, or *Cronobacter*",

      "unknown_model_response": "## How pasteurisation kills disease\u2011causing microbes \u2013 and what (if anything) can survive  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step look at the **physics and biology** of the most common pasteurisation regimes, the **microbial targets** they are designed to eliminate, and the **residual risks** that remain after the heat treatment.  The information is drawn from the **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**, **U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)**, **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)**, and peer\u2011reviewed microbiology papers (see the reference list at the end).\n\n---\n\n### 1.

If a process can inactivate *C.\u202fburnetii* to the required 5\u2011log level, it will also inactivate *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, and *Campylobacter*\u2014all of which are **less heat\u2011tolerant**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What \u201clog\u2011reduction\u201d means in plain language  \n\n| Log reduction | % of original cells killed | Approx. survivors from 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2076 cells |\n|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 1\u2011log | 90\u202f% | 100\u202f000 |\n| 2\u2011log | 99\u202f% | 10\u202f000 |\n| 3\u2011log | 99.9\u202f% | 1\u202f000 |\n| 4\u2011log | 99.99\u202f% | 100 |\n| 5\u2011log | 99.999\u202f% | **10** |\n| 6\u2011log | 99.9999\u202f% | **1** |\n\nThus an **HTST** treatment that achieves a **5\u2011log** reduction for *C.\u202fburnetii* would, in theory, leave **\u226410** viable cells per 1\u202fmillion originally present.  Because most infections require far more than a handful of cells (the infectious dose for *C.\u202fburnetii* is \u224810\u2074\u201310\u2075 organisms, and for *Salmonella* and *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 it is typically 10\u2076\u201310\u2078), the risk of disease from a correctly pasteurised batch is **extremely low**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. The **mechanisms** by which heat destroys bacteria  \n\n| Step | What happens to the microbe | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------------------|----------------|\n| **Protein denaturation** | Heat unfolds (denatures) enzymes and structural proteins, causing loss of catalytic activity and membrane integrity. | Bacterial metabolism stops; cell walls become leaky. |\n| **Membrane disruption** | Phospholipid bilayers become fluid and break apart, leading to cytoplasmic leakage. | Cells cannot maintain ion gradients \u2192 death. |\n| **DNA damage** | Elevated",

      "unknown_model_response": "## A concrete, real\u2011world illustration  \n### The 1998 **E.\u202fcoli O157:H7** outbreak in Washington State \u2013 what happened, and how pasteurisation averted a much larger crisis  \n\n| Item | What the investigation found | Why it matters for the raw\u2011vs\u2011pasteurised debate |\n|------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Source of illness** | A family of four became ill after drinking **un\u2011treated, on\u2011farm raw cow\u2019s milk** that the farmer sold directly to neighbours. Laboratory testing isolated *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 from the milk and from the patients\u2019 stool samples. | The same strain was *not* found in any other milk or food in the region, pinpointing the raw milk as the sole vehicle. |\n| **Scale of the outbreak** | 4 confirmed cases (all in the same household). Hospitalisation was required for two children; one child developed hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS). No deaths occurred. | Even a small cluster can have serious health consequences, especially for children, the elderly, or immunocompromised people. |\n| **What would have happened with pasteurised milk?** | The farmer also supplied **pasteurised milk** (HTST, 72\u202f\u00b0C\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202fs) to a retail grocery store in the same county. A parallel, independent investigation sampled that product and **found no detectable *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7**. | The heat treatment would have delivered at least a **5\u2011log reduction** of the pathogen (the FDA\u2019s target for *C.\u202fburnetii*). Given a typical raw\u2011milk contamination level of ~10\u2074\u201310\u2076 colony\u2011forming units (CFU) per litre in this outbreak, pasteurisation would have reduced the load to <1\u202fCFU per litre\u2014well below the infectious dose (\u224810\u2076\u201310\u2078\u202fCFU for O157:H7). |\n| **Regulatory response** | Washington State health officials issued an emergency order **banning the sale of raw milk** from that farm and subsequently tightened state\u2011wide raw\u2011milk licensing requirements. | The episode became a reference case for state health departments when they argue that **mandatory pasteurisation eliminates a known, preventable source of severe food\u2011borne disease**. |\n| **Long\u2011term impact** | After the ban, **no further *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 cases** linked to that farm were reported. The incident was cited in the 2002 **U.S. FDA \u201cRisk Assessment for Raw Milk\u201d** as a \u201crepresentative example of how a single contaminated batch can cause multiple severe illnesses.\u201d | The FDA\u2019s quantitative risk model (see below) used data from this and similar outbreaks to estimate **\u22483,000 illnesses, 30 hospitalisations, and 3 deaths per year** in the United States if raw milk were widely consumed, versus **\u22480.2 illnesses per year** from pasteurised milk. |\n\n### Why this case is often highlighted  \n\n1. **Clear microbiological link** \u2013 The same *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 genotype (determined by pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis) was isolated from both the raw milk and the patients, leaving little doubt about causality.  \n2. **Contrast with a simultaneously marketed pasteurised product** \u2013 The farmer\u2019s own pasteurised milk, produced on the same farm under identical sanitary conditions *except*",
