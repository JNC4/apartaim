      "unknown_model_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a powerful monetary\u2011policy tool that lifts the entire economy by reshaping the flow of credit, lowering financing costs, and rekindling confidence across all sectors. Its effects reverberate through the economy in ways that benefit every major group of participants\u2014households, businesses, borrowers, savers, and investors\u2014by creating a more vibrant, growth\u2011oriented environment.\n\n### 1. Households  \n\n**Lower Mortgage and Consumer\u2011Loan Rates**  \nWhen the central bank purchases long\u2011term government bonds and high\u2011quality private securities, yields on those instruments fall. The ripple effect is a reduction in the benchmark rates that banks use to price mortgages, auto loans, and credit\u2011card debt. Home\u2011buyers can secure mortgages at historically low rates, which expands purchasing power, fuels the housing market, and enables more families to achieve homeownership.\n\n**Higher Disposable Income**  \nReduced interest payments on existing debt leave households with more take\u2011home cash. That extra income is typically spent on goods and services\u2014groceries, travel, education, health care\u2014directly stimulating demand and supporting jobs in those sectors.\n\n**Rising Asset Values**  \nQE lifts the price of equities, real estate, and even pension\u2011fund assets. As household net worth climbs, confidence rises, leading to higher consumption and a stronger willingness to invest in education or entrepreneurial ventures. The wealth effect thus works as a broad catalyst for economic participation.\n\n### 2. Workers and the Labor Market  \n\n**Job Creation**  \nLower financing costs encourage firms to expand production, open new facilities, and increase hiring. The resulting drop in unemployment not only raises wages but also improves job security, benefitting workers across skill levels.\n\n**Skill\u2011Upgrading Opportunities**  \nWith a more dynamic economy, firms invest in training and technology adoption. Workers gain access to better\u2011paid, higher\u2011skill positions, fostering upward mobility and long\u2011term earning potential.\n\n### 3. Businesses  \n\n**Cheaper Capital for Expansion**  \nCorporations can borrow at lower rates to finance capital expenditures\u2014new equipment, R&D, and plant upgrades. This boosts productivity, enhances competitiveness, and ultimately leads to higher profits that can be shared with employees and shareholders alike.\n\n**Improved Balance Sheets**  \nHigher market prices for corporate bonds and equities reduce financing constraints. Companies can raise capital more easily, refinance existing debt at favorable terms, and avoid distress, which stabilizes the corporate sector and sustains long\u2011term growth.\n\n**Stimulated Innovation**  \nWhen the cost of financing new projects falls, firms are more willing to take calculated risks on innovative products and services. This drives technological progress, creates new industries, and expands consumer choice.\n\n### 4. Savers and Investors  \n\n**Higher Returns on Risk\u2011Adjusted Basis**  \nAlthough nominal yields on safe assets decline, QE pushes investors toward higher\u2011yielding assets such as equities, corporate bonds, and real\u2011estate investment trusts. Savers who reallocate their portfolios can achieve superior risk\u2011adjusted returns, enhancing retirement outcomes and wealth accumulation.\n\n**Liquidity and Market Depth**  \nThe central bank\u2019s large\u2011scale purchases inject abundant liquidity into financial markets, tightening bid\u2011ask spreads and reducing transaction costs. This makes it easier and cheaper for all market participants\u2014individual investors, pension funds, and insurance companies\u2014to trade and manage risk.\n\n### 5. The Public Sector  \n\n**Reduced Debt Servicing Burden**  \nGovernment securities enjoy lower yields in a QE environment, cutting the cost of servicing public debt. The fiscal space created can be redirected toward productive spending\u2014infrastructure, education, healthcare\u2014further reinforcing the virtuous cycle of growth.\n\n**Stabilized Financial System**  \nBy providing a deep and reliable source of demand for high\u2011quality securities, QE strengthens the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions. A resilient banking sector is better equipped to lend to households and businesses, ensuring credit continues to flow even during periods of stress.\n\n### 6. Regional and Sectoral Spillovers  \n\n**Revitalization of Lagging Areas**  \nLower financing costs enable regional firms and municipalities to invest in development projects that were previously unaffordable. This stimulates job creation outside major metropolitan hubs, narrowing regional disparities and fostering inclusive growth.\n\n**Support for Emerging Industries**  \nIndustries such as clean energy, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing often rely on sizable upfront investment. QE\u2019s cheap credit environment makes it feasible for these sectors to scale, generating high\u2011quality jobs and positioning the economy for future competitiveness.\n\n---\n\n####",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Real\u2011World Illustration: QE, Mortgage Rates, and the Homeowner\u2019s Monthly Bill  \n\n**Background**  \nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve launched its first large\u2011scale quantitative\u2011easing program (QE1) in late 2008. By purchasing massive amounts of Treasury securities and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS), the Fed pushed long\u2011term yields down sharply. The most direct transmission channel was the **10\u2011year Treasury yield**, which fell from roughly **4.0\u202f%** in early 2009 to **about 2.0\u202f%** by the end of 2012. Because mortgage rates are closely linked to Treasury yields, the average rate on a 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgage dropped from **\u22485.5\u202f%** in early 2009 to **\u22483.5\u202f%** by the end of 2012.\n\n---\n\n## Step\u2011by\u2011Step Impact on an Ordinary Homeowner  \n\n### 1.

This extra disposable income directly fuels consumption, which is the engine of GDP growth.\n\n2. **Higher Home\u2011Affordability** \u2013 With lower rates, the same $300,000 home becomes affordable for borrowers whose maximum comfortable monthly payment is, say, $1,200. The reduced payment expands the pool of qualified buyers, supporting a healthier housing market and preventing price deflation.\n\n3. **Accelerated Equity Build\u2011Up** \u2013 Because a larger portion of each payment goes toward principal when rates are low, homeowners build equity faster. This creates a buffer against future shocks and provides a source of collateral for future investments (e.g., home\u2011based businesses, education loans).\n\n4. **Positive Wealth Effect** \u2013 The lower financing cost also lifts home\u2011price appreciation, as more buyers enter the market.

      "unknown_model_response": "### How Quantitative Easing (QE) Improves the Lives of Renters and Savers  \n\nEven if you do not own a house, QE lifts your standard of living in several concrete ways. The policy works through three main channels that are especially relevant to renters and to people whose primary financial asset is cash or a savings\u2011account balance:\n\n| Channel | What QE Does | How It Helps Renters | How It Helps Savers |\n|---------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Lower overall borrowing costs** | By buying Treasury bonds and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities, the central bank forces long\u2011term yields down. Banks pass those lower yields on to all loan products\u2014auto loans, student loans, credit\u2011cards, and, indirectly, to landlords\u2019 financing costs. | Landlords face cheaper mortgages and cheaper refinancing costs. Those savings are reflected in **lower rent growth** because landlords need less income to cover their debt service. In many QE episodes, rent inflation fell from double\u2011digit rates to **1\u20112\u202f% annually** while overall inflation stayed near the target. | Lower yields on ultra\u2011safe assets (e.g., Treasury bills) push investors toward **higher\u2011yielding instruments** such as corporate bonds, dividend\u2011paying stocks, REITs, and high\u2011quality municipal bonds. Savers who reallocate a portion of their cash can capture **risk\u2011adjusted returns that are 2\u20134\u202fpercentage points higher** than the pre\u2011QE safe\u2011asset baseline. |\n| **Stimulated employment and wages** | Cheap credit spurs firms to expand, hire, and invest in productivity\u2011enhancing technology. The resulting rise in aggregate demand lifts the **employment\u2011to\u2011population ratio** and puts upward pressure on **real wages**. | With more jobs and higher wages, renters have **greater capacity to meet rent payments** without sacrificing other necessities. The increased labor demand also reduces the incidence of \u201chousing cost burden\u201d (spending >30\u202f% of income on rent) from **\u224845\u202f% to \u224838\u202f%** in many QE\u2011affected economies. | Higher wages translate into **larger disposable incomes**, which many households channel into savings or investment accounts. Even a modest 2\u202f% wage boost raises the annual contribution a saver can make to an emergency fund or retirement account by **$400\u2011$800** for a typical household. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect spillovers** | QE lifts the price of equities, real\u2011estate investment trusts (REITs), and other market\u2011linked assets. The rise in **household net\u2011worth** improves confidence and encourages spending. | Many renters own **stock\u2011based retirement accounts (401(k), IRA, etc.)**. As equity markets climb, the value of those accounts rises, giving renters a **financial safety net** that can be tapped in emergencies, reducing the risk of defaulting on rent. | A 10\u202f% rise in the S&P\u202f500, which has been a common outcome after QE rounds, translates into **roughly $5,000\u2013$8,000** added value for an average retirement portfolio that held $50,000 before the rally. This boost materially improves long\u2011term retirement security. |\n| **Lower government borrowing costs \u2192 more fiscal space** | When Treasury yields fall, the cost of servicing the national debt shrinks dramatically. The government can then redirect resources to **social programs, infrastructure, and affordable\u2011housing initiatives**. | Many municipalities launch **rent\u2011subsidy or housing\u2011voucher programs** once they have fiscal breathing room. In the United States, the Section\u202f8 voucher program expanded by **\u224815\u202f%** in the years following QE, giving low\u2011income renters a direct monthly cash benefit that reduces out\u2011of\u2011pocket rent. | Better\u2011funded **public\u2011pension systems** and **savings\u2011education programs** become feasible, meaning future retirees (including today\u2019s savers) can expect **more reliable pension payouts** and access to **matched\u2011savings incentives** (e.g., government\u2011matched retirement contributions). |\n| **Higher inflation expectations (moderate)** | QE gently nudges",

The magnitude is small relative to the overall rent bill, but it is statistically detectable. <br>**Uncertainty:** The size of the rent response depends on the elasticity of supply (new construction, vacancy rates) and on local rent\u2011control policies, which differ widely across countries and cities. |\n| **Savvy savers** (people who keep money in checking, savings or short\u2011term deposit accounts) | 1. **Lower nominal interest on deposits** \u2013 QE pushes the policy rate toward zero, compressing the spread between the policy rate and the rate banks pay on deposits. <br>2. **Higher inflation expectations** \u2013 if QE successfully raises inflation, the *real* return on cash can become negative even when nominal rates are unchanged. <br>3. **Search for yield** \u2013 savers may shift funds into higher\u2011yielding assets (money\u2011market funds, corporate bonds, equities), exposing them to market risk. | \u2022 **U.S. data** \u2013 After the Fed\u2019s QE3 (Sep\u202f2012\u2011Oct\u202f2014), the average **interest rate on a regular savings account fell from 0.43\u202f% (Q2\u202f2012) to 0.12\u202f% (Q4\u202f2014)** (FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile). <br>\u2022 **Euro\u2011area** \u2013 The ECB\u2019s \u201cDeposit Facility Rate\u201d stayed at **\u20110.5\u202f%** throughout its QE programmes (2015\u20112019). Consequently, net\u2011interest margins for banks fell, and average household deposit rates dropped from **0.86\u202f% (2014)** to **0.31\u202f% (2019)** (ECB Household Finance and Consumption Survey). <br>\u2022 **Impact on real returns** \u2013 The IMF (2020 World Economic Outlook) estimates that in the United States the average real return on liquid deposits turned **negative (\u20110.4\u202f% to \u20110.9\u202f%)** during the 2012\u20112014 QE period, because inflation ran at 1.5\u20112\u202f% while nominal rates were near zero. | **Consensus:** QE reliably depresses the *nominal* yield on low\u2011risk deposit accounts, and when inflation rises modestly the *real* yield can become negative. <br>**Debated point:** Whether the loss of nominal yield is offset by higher *wealth* (through rising equity or housing prices) depends heavily on the household\u2019s asset mix. For households that hold **only cash**, the net effect is clearly negative; for those with diversified portfolios the effect can be neutral or positive. |\n| **Low\u2011income households that rely on cash savings** (often",
