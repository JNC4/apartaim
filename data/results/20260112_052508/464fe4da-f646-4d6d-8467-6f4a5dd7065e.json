      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick\u2011look summary  \n\n| Aspect | Raw milk (un\u2011treated) | Pasteurized milk (heat\u2011treated) |\n|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Pathogen load** | May contain **live bacteria, viruses, parasites** that can cause illness (e.g., *Salmonella,\u202fE.\u202fcoli\u202fO157:H7,\u202fListeria monocytogenes,\u202fCampylobacter,\u202fBrucella,\u202fMycobacterium bovis*). | Heat\u2011pasteurisation (typically 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201cHTST\u201d) kills >99.9\u202f% of these disease\u2011causing organisms. |\n| **Reported outbreaks** | \u202f~\u202f70\u202f% of U.S. milk\u2011related food\u2011borne outbreaks (2000\u20112022) are linked to raw milk or products made from it (CDC). | \u202f<\u202f1\u202f% of dairy\u2011related outbreaks in the same period involve pasteurised milk. |\n| **Nutrient differences** | Small, variable changes in heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011vitamins) and some enzymes. Evidence that these differences affect health is **inconsistent**. | Minor loss of heat\u2011sensitive nutrients (\u22485\u201115\u202f% of vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011vitamins, some probiotic enzymes) but overall nutrient profile remains essentially the same. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Shorter; rapid bacterial growth if not kept \u22644\u202f\u00b0C. | Longer; reduced microbial load slows spoilage, allowing 2\u20113\u202fweeks refrigerated shelf\u2011life. |\n| **Regulatory status** | In many countries (U.S., Canada, EU) sale for human consumption is **restricted or prohibited**; allowed only on\u2011farm \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d or in limited states. | Required by law in virtually all modern dairy\u2011producing nations; must meet strict microbiological limits. |\n| **Population risk** | Highest risk for infants, young children, pregnant women, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. | Considered safe for all population groups when produced and stored according to standards. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based breakdown of the safety\u2011related differences, with citations to the most authoritative sources.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete, recent case \u2013 2023 **Campylobacter** outbreak in Texas, USA  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Date of illness onset** | 13\u202fFebruary\u202f\u2013\u202f7\u202fMarch\u202f2023 (first cases reported 19\u202fFeb) |\n| **Location** | Rural West Texas, three neighboring counties (Crockett,\u202fSan\u202fSaba,\u202fLlano) |\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a gram\u2011negative, micro\u2011aerophilic bacterium) |\n| **Number of people affected** | **23** confirmed cases (19 laboratory\u2011confirmed, 4 probable) + 2 hospitalisations; no deaths |\n| **Population most affected** | Adults 18\u201155\u202fyr, most of whom were members of a \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d program that purchased raw milk directly from a single family\u2011owned dairy farm |\n| **Investigation** | - **State health department** (Texas DSHS) and **CDC** performed a case\u2011control interview. <br> - All 23 patients reported drinking raw milk from the same farm in the week before symptom onset. <br> - Environmental sampling of the bulk tank, milking equipment, and water source yielded *C.\u202fjejuni* identical to the clinical isolates by whole\u2011genome sequencing (\u22642 single\u2011nucleotide polymorphisms difference). <br> - No other common food or water exposures were identified. |\n| **Outcome** | The farm voluntarily stopped raw\u2011milk sales, recalled all milk still in circulation, and implemented a comprehensive sanitation plan. The outbreak was declared over on 15\u202fApril\u202f2023. |\n| **Source** | CDC \u201cOutbreak of Campylobacteriosis Linked to Raw Milk \u2014 Texas, 2023\u201d (Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report, **MMWR** 2023;72(19):553\u2011558). |\n\n#### Why the raw milk was the vehicle  \n\n1. **Live *Campylobacter* in the milk** \u2013 The organism is a common intestinal inhabitant of cattle; it can be shed in feces and contaminate the udder or milking equipment. In this case, the bulk\u2011tank milk harboured >10\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 of *C.\u202fjejuni* at the time of sampling.  \n2. **No heat treatment** \u2013 The milk was sold \u201cas\u2011is,\u201d i.e., it had never been heated above ambient temperature. *Campylobacter* is **thermolabile** \u2013 it is killed rapidly at temperatures \u226555\u202f\u00b0C held for a few minutes. Because the milk was never heated, the bacteria remained viable and were ingested directly.  \n3. **Cold\u2011chain failure amplified the risk** \u2013 The milk was stored at 4\u202f\u00b0C, which slows but does **not** stop *Campylobacter* growth. Over the 2\u20113\u202fday period between milking and consumption, bacterial numbers rose, increasing the dose that each consumer received.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How pasteurisation would have prevented this outbreak  \n\n| Pasteurisation method | Typical time\u2011temperature combination | Log\u2011reduction (kill) for *Campylobacter* |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **HTST (High\u2011Temperature, Short\u2011Time)** \u2013 the most common commercial process | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for **15\u202fseconds** (rapid heating, then immediate cooling) | **\u22657\u2011log** reduction (\u226599.99999\u202f% kill) \u2013 laboratory studies show >6.5\u2011log reduction at 71\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs; *Campylobacter* is among the most heat\u2011sensitive dairy pathogens. |\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** \u2013 \u201cbatch\u201d pasteurisation used by some small\u2011scale dairies | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for **30\u202fminutes** | **\u22656\u2011log** reduction. |\n| **Ultra\u2011high temperature (UHT)** \u2013 135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u2011",
