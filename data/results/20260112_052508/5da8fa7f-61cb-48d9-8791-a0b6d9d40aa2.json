      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) usually raise the overall size of the economy and lower the prices of many consumer goods, but their effects on workers are mixed.  In the short run some workers lose jobs or see wages fall in industries that face new foreign competition, while other workers gain jobs or higher pay in sectors that expand because of new export opportunities.  The net impact on a country\u2019s labour force depends on the structure of its economy, the flexibility of its labour market, and the strength of accompanying policies (e.g., training, unemployment insurance, labour\u2011rights clauses).\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the main findings from the academic literature, international\u2011organisation reports, and policy evaluations that together form the mainstream consensus.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer** \u2013  The bulk of scholarly work agrees that **free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) raise the size of the economies that sign them**, but the *distribution* of those gains for workers is highly mixed.  In most cases some groups of workers see higher wages, more stable employment, and better consumer prices, while other groups experience job loss, wage pressure, or weaker bargaining power.  The net effect for any given worker depends on\u202f*industry, skill level, geographic location, and the strength of domestic labour\u2011market institutions*.\n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview that pulls together the strongest findings from every side of the debate, notes where consensus exists, highlights where scholars still disagree, and points out evidence that is often left out of popular discussions.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What FTAs are and how they are expected to work (theory)\n\n| Theoretical claim | Mechanism | Typical expectation for workers |\n|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Comparative advantage** (Ricardo, 1817) | Countries specialize in goods where they have lower relative costs; trade expands total output. | *Positive*: higher national income \u2192 potentially higher wages and more jobs in export\u2011oriented sectors. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin) | Trade equalises the price of labour, capital, land across countries. | *Mixed*: Low\u2011skill workers in high\u2011wage countries may see wage pressure; high\u2011skill workers may benefit. |\n| **Dynamic gains** (learning\u2011by\u2011doing, technology diffusion) | Exposure to foreign firms raises productivity, spurs innovation. | *Positive*: higher productivity can translate into higher wages and better\u2011paid jobs, especially for skilled workers. |\n| **Trade\u2011off with labour standards** | If an FTA includes \u201csocial\u2011clause\u201d provisions, firms must meet certain standards to trade. | *Positive*: can raise minimum wages and safety standards where enforcement is strong; *negative*: may reduce investment or shift jobs abroad if standards are too costly. |\n\n**Consensus among economists** \u2013 Nearly all agree on the *first\u2011order* prediction that FTAs increase total economic surplus (GDP, consumer welfare).  The *second\u2011order* prediction\u2014how that surplus is divided among workers\u2014is where the literature diverges.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the empirical record shows\n\n### 2.1.
