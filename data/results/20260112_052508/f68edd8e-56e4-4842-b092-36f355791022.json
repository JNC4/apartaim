What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Element | Typical practice | Variations |\n|---------|------------------|------------|\n| **Goal** | Remove firearms from private hands, ideally those most likely to be used in violence or accidental injury. | Some programs also aim to promote safe\u2011storage education, collect data on gun types, or build community\u2011trust. |\n| **Voluntary vs. compulsory** | *Voluntary*: owners bring a gun to a designated site and receive a cash or voucher payment.  <br>*Compulsory*: rare in democratic societies; usually a one\u2011time \u201cmandatory surrender\u201d after a law change (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 program). | In the United States, all buy\u2011backs to date have been voluntary; the Australian 1996 program was a *compulsory* \u201cnational buy\u2011back\u201d that required owners to register and surrender certain firearms. |\n| **Funding source** | Municipal or state budgets, sometimes supplemented by private foundations, NGOs, or law\u2011enforcement grants. | In Australia the federal government funded the 1996 buy\u2011back (\u2248\u202fAU$1.5\u202fbillion). In U.S. cities the cost per gun can range from $100\u2013$300, paid from local police or grant money. |\n| **Payment method** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or \u201cstore credit.\u201d Amounts are often flat (e.g., $100 per gun) or tiered by caliber/type. | Some programs give higher amounts for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles) or for multiple guns. |\n| **Logistics** | A single day or a series of events at police stations, community centers, schools, or mobile sites.  <br>Gun collection is usually supervised by law\u2011enforcement, and the weapons are later destroyed (e.g., by melting, shredding, or crushing). | Mobile \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d units can travel to neighborhoods with low police presence to increase participation. |\n| **Eligibility** | Generally any legal gun owner, sometimes with age limits (e.g., 18+).  <br>Some programs exclude firearms that are already illegal (e.g., fully automatic weapons in the U.S.). | In Australia, the 1996 buy\u2011back only covered *registered* semi\u2011automatic rifles, shotguns and handguns; illegal weapons remained on the black market. |\n| **Data collection** | Most programs record the make, model, caliber, and serial number (if any) of each surrendered firearm. | In the U.S., anonymity is often guaranteed to encourage participation, limiting the amount of usable data. |\n\n### Key design choices that affect outcomes  \n\n1. **Incentive size** \u2013 Larger cash payments are associated with higher participation rates, but also with higher program costs.  \n2. **Frequency** \u2013 One\u2011off national buy\u2011backs (e.g., Australia 1996) remove a large stock of guns quickly; recurring local buy\u2011backs may keep a \u201csteady drain\u201d on the supply of guns that might otherwise be sold or transferred.  \n3. **Targeting** \u2013 Some programs try to focus on *high\u2011risk* firearms (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles, high\u2011capacity magazines). Others are \u201cblanket\u201d programs that accept any firearm.  \n4. **Publicity & community trust** \u2013 Outreach through community groups, faith\u2011based organizations, or local media can boost turnout, especially in neighborhoods with historically low police\u2011legitimacy.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.

What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Element | Typical design (U.S. & other high\u2011income countries) | Why it is set up that way |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Voluntary surrender** | Owners bring firearms to a designated site (police station, community center, fair\u2011ground) and hand them over **without fear of prosecution** (often a \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d policy). | Lowers the barrier for people who might otherwise keep a gun hidden because they fear legal consequences. |\n| **Monetary incentive** | Cash, gift cards, or vouchers are offered per gun (often $50\u2011$200 in the U.S.; up to AU$500 in Australia). Some programs give higher amounts for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles, large\u2011capacity magazines). | Provides an immediate, tangible benefit that can outweigh the perceived utility of the gun. |\n| **Time\u2011limited event** | Usually a one\u2011day or a few\u2011day \u201cevent\u201d advertised heavily in local media. Some jurisdictions run *recurring* events (e.g., annual or semi\u2011annual). | Concentrates publicity and logistical resources; the \u201cdeadline\u201d creates a sense of urgency. |\n| **Legal safe\u2011harbor** | Federal or state law usually grants immunity from prosecution for illegal possession of the surrendered weapons (e.g., U.S. \u201cGun Control Act\u201d Section\u202f4473, Australian *Firearms Act* 1996). | Encourages people with otherwise unlawful weapons to come forward. |\n| **Collection & disposition** | Turned\u2011in firearms are either (a) destroyed (shredded, melted), (b) sold to licensed dealers, or (c) transferred to law\u2011enforcement evidence. In some countries (e.g., Australia) the proceeds fund other gun\u2011control measures. | Destroys the weapon from the community\u2019s pool; revenue recycling can increase political support. |\n| **Optional ancillary services** | Safety\u2011training workshops, mental\u2011health referrals, or \u201cgun\u2011safety\u201d education are sometimes bundled. | Tries to address broader risk factors beyond the mere removal of a gun. |\n\n### Key variations that matter for outcomes\n1. **Scope of the program** \u2013 *National* (Australia 1996), *state\u2011wide* (e.g., Connecticut 1993), *city\u2011wide* (e.g., Seattle 2014), or *neighborhood* (e.g., Baltimore 2022).  \n2. **Targeted weapons** \u2013 Some buybacks focus on *all* firearms; others restrict to \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d categories (assault\u2011style rifles, .50 BMG, etc.).  \n3. **Funding source** \u2013 Federal grants, state budgets, private philanthropy, or a combination.  \n4. **Follow\u2011up enforcement** \u2013 Some programs pair the buyback with *increased* background\u2011check enforcement or \u201cred\u2011flag\u201d orders; others are stand\u2011alone.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.

Australia \u2013 1996 National Firearms Buy\u2011Back (Post\u2011Port Arthur)\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Legislative context** | The **National Firearms Agreement (NFA)** was passed after the 1996 Port\u202fArthur mass\u2011shooting (35 dead). The NFA introduced a **comprehensive licensing/registration system**, a ban on semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and high\u2011capacity magazines, and a **compulsory, federally funded buy\u2011back** of all firearms that became illegal under the new law. |\n| **Scope & cost** | **~650,000 firearms** (\u2248\u202f65\u202f% of the civilian stock) were surrendered over an 18\u2011month period; the program cost **AU$1.5\u202fbillion** (\u2248\u202fUS$1.1\u202fbillion in 1996 dollars). |\n| **Data source** | Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) provide monthly counts of **firearm\u2011related deaths** (homicides, suicides, accidents) from 1979\u20112019. |\n| **Analytic approach** | 1) **Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS)** with segmented regression (Chapman, Alpert & Alpers, 2006). 2) **Synthetic\u2011control method** comparing Australia to a weighted combination of 8 \u201ccontrol\u201d OECD countries that did **not** implement a comparable buy\u2011back (Klein, 2022). |\n| **Main outcomes** | \u2022 **Firearm homicide rate** fell from **1.45 per 100\u202f000** (1995) to **0.71 per 100\u202f000** (1997) \u2013 a **~51\u202f% reduction** (p\u202f<\u202f0.01).  <br>\u2022 **Firearm suicide rate** dropped from **3.3** to **2.0 per 100\u202f000** over the same period \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f39\u202f% decline** (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).  <br>\u2022 **Overall homicide rate** (all weapons) fell modestly (\u2248\u202f8\u202f%); **overall suicide rate** was unchanged, indicating the effect was specific to firearms. |\n| **Interpretation** | The **temporal alignment** (sharp drop beginning in late 1996, sustained through 1998) and the **absence of a similar decline in the synthetic\u2011control comparator** suggest the buy\u2011back (combined with the licensing ban) removed a substantial number of guns that were being used in lethal incidents.  <br>**Limitations**: <br>\u2022 The program was **mandatory** and accompanied by **stringent licensing**, making it impossible to isolate the buy\u2011back from the broader regulatory package. <br>\u2022 Some scholars argue that the **pre\u2011existing downward trend** in firearm homicide (started in the early 1990s) accounts for part of the observed change (Miller, 2018). <br>\u2022 Illegal firearms that were never registered were **not** captured by the buy\u2011back, so the total \u201crisk pool\u201d was not eliminated. |\n| **Key citation** | Chapman, S., Alpert, G., & Alpers, P.
