What \u201craw\u201d and \u201cpasteurized\u201d actually mean  \n\n| Term | Definition | Typical processing steps |\n|------|------------|--------------------------|\n| **Raw milk** | Milk taken directly from a lactating animal **without any heat treatment** (or only minimal cooling). | Collected, cooled to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C, and shipped to the consumer. No intentional killing of microbes. |\n| **Pasteurized milk** | Milk that has been **heated to a specific temperature for a set time** to reduce the microbial load. | Most common methods: <br>\u2022 **HTST (High\u2011Temperature Short\u2011Time)** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (U.S. standard). <br>\u2022 **LTLT (Low\u2011Temperature Long\u2011Time)** \u2013 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin (often used for specialty cheeses). <br>\u2022 **UHT (Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temperature)** \u2013 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (shelf\u2011stable milk). |\n\nThe heat step **does not sterilize** the milk; it reduces the number of viable microorganisms by 5\u20137 log units (a factor of 100\u202f000\u201310\u202f000\u202f000).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. The main safety\u2011related differences  \n\n| Aspect | Raw Milk | Pasteurized Milk |\n|--------|----------|-------------------|\n| **Pathogen load** | May contain **any bacteria, viruses, or parasites** present in the cow\u2019s udder, on the farm environment, or introduced during milking. Typical pathogens: *Salmonella spp.*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (including toxin\u2011producing strains), *Brucella spp.*, *Mycobacterium bovis*, and various enteric viruses. | Heat kills >99.999\u202f% of vegetative bacteria and almost all common pathogens. Only heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum*) and some thermophilic *Bacillus* spp. may survive, but they are rarely present in milk at harmful levels. |\n| **Microbial count (CFU/ml)** | Often 10\u2074\u201310\u2076 colony\u2011forming units (CFU) per millilitre, depending on farm hygiene. | Typically \u2264\u202f10\u00b3\u202fCFU/ml after pasteurization; most commercial milk is \u2264\u202f10\u00b2\u202fCFU/ml. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | 7\u201310\u202fdays under refrigeration (if kept \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C). Spoilage organisms multiply quickly; off\u2011flavors appear early. | 14\u201321\u202fdays (HTST) or >\u202f30\u202fdays (UHT) under refrigeration; spoilage is delayed because most microbes have been killed. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme profile** | Retains native enzymes (e.g., lipase, alkaline phosphatase), some heat\u2011labile vitamins (B\u2011complex, C), and native whey proteins in their \u201craw\u201d conformation. | Heat denatures some proteins (e.g., \u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin), destroys most enzymes (alkaline phosphatase is used as a **process control** to confirm pasteurization), and reduces levels of vitamin C and some B\u2011vitamins (loss typically <\u202f10\u202f%). |\n| **Allergy & intolerance claims** | Some anecdotal reports of reduced symptoms for lactose intolerance or milk protein allergy, attributed to the presence of lactase\u2011producing bacteria or altered protein structures. Evidence is **weak and not reproducible** in controlled trials. | No reliable evidence that pasteurization worsens lactose intolerance or allergy; the process does not remove lactose or major milk proteins. |\n| **Regulatory status (U.S.)** | Legal to sell in 31 states (often under \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d or \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d exemptions). Must be labeled \u201craw milk \u2013 not pasteurized.\u201d | Required for all retail sale of fluid milk in the remaining states; must meet federal Grade \u201cA\u201d standards and be pasteurized unless specifically exempted (e.g., for cheese >\u202f60\u202fdays aging). |\n\n---\n\n### 3.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Pasteurised milk** \u2013\u202fthe scientific and public\u2011health consensus is that it is *substantially safer* because the heat\u2011treatment reliably kills the bacteria that cause most milk\u2011borne food\u2011borne illness, while retaining essentially the same nutritional profile as raw milk.  \n- **Raw (un\u2011pasteurised) milk** \u2013\u202fit can be safe *under very strict farm\u2011level controls*, but in practice the risk of contamination with pathogenic bacteria (e.g., *Salmonella,\u202fE.\u202fcoli\u202fO157:H7,\u202fListeria monocytogenes,\u202fCampylobacter*) is consistently higher than for pasteurised milk.  The alleged health benefits of raw milk are not supported by robust, large\u2011scale evidence, and the potential harms are well documented.\n\nBelow is a comprehensive, evidence\u2011based breakdown of what is known, where the data are strong, where uncertainties remain, and which points are often misunderstood or omitted.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cpasteurisation\u2019\u2019 actually does\n\n| Process | Typical parameters (U.S./EU standards) | Primary effect |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Kills vegetative bacteria; retains most heat\u2011labile nutrients |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (U.S.) / 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (EU) | Same microbiological kill, slightly more loss of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs | Near\u2011sterile; longer shelf life, greater loss of some vitamins & flavors |\n\n**Microbiological impact** \u2013 The heat destroys >99.999\u202f% of *pathogenic* bacteria that may be present in raw milk. It also inactivates most *spoilage* organisms, extending shelf life.\n\n**Nutrient impact** \u2013 The most heat\u2011sensitive constituents (vitamin\u202fC, some B\u2011vitamins, certain enzymes) are reduced by 5\u201130\u202f% in HTST milk; UHT milk loses a larger fraction (up to 50\u202f% of vitamin\u202fC). However, milk is not a major source of vitamin\u202fC in most diets, and the overall protein, calcium, and most vitamin/mineral content remain essentially unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What is in *raw* milk that matters for safety?\n\n| Category | Typical organisms (if present) | Health relevance |\n|----------|--------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Pathogenic bacteria** | *Salmonella spp.*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin\u2011producing) | Cause gastroenteritis, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome, meningitis, miscarriage, death in vulnerable groups |\n| **Non\u2011pathogenic / probiotic bacteria** | *Lactobacillus spp.*, *Bifidobacterium spp.*, *Lactococcus spp.* | Potentially beneficial for gut microbiota, but evidence of clinical benefit from raw milk consumption is weak |\n| **Spoilage organisms** | Psychrotrophic *Pseudomonas*, *Bacillus* spp. | Reduce shelf life, may produce heat\u2011stable enzymes that survive pasteurisation and cause off\u2011flavors |\n\nThe presence of",

The dairy\u2019s \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d program sold unpasteurised milk directly to consumers. |\n| **Laboratory Evidence** | \u2022 *C.\u202fjejuni* was isolated from the bulk raw\u2011milk tank and from the udder swab of a single cow that was shedding the bacteria. <br>\u2022 Pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns from patient stool isolates matched the milk isolate (\u2265\u202f95\u202f% similarity). |\n| **Investigation Findings** | \u2022 The implicated cow had a recent case of mastitis and was being treated with antibiotics, which can increase shedding of *Campylobacter* in milk. <br>\u2022 The farm\u2019s milking equipment was not regularly sanitized with a validated cleaning protocol; residual organic matter created a niche for bacterial growth. |\n| **Public\u2011Health Action** | The dairy voluntarily ceased raw\u2011milk sales; the state issued a **temporary \u201cstop\u2011sale\u201d order**. A public\u2011health advisory warned residents to avoid raw milk until the farm corrected hygiene practices. |\n| **Outcome** | No further cases after the milk was removed from the market. The farm later installed a certified pasteurisation unit and resumed sales of **pasteurised** milk. |\n\n**Key Take\u2011away:** The *Campylobacter* organisms survived the farm\u2019s cooling and refrigeration steps because they are **not heat\u2011sensitive** at those temperatures. They were present in sufficient numbers (\u2248\u202f10\u2074\u201310\u2075\u202fCFU\u202f/\u202fmL) to cause infection after a single 250\u2011mL serving.\n\n---\n\n### How Pasteurisation Would Have Prevented This Outbreak  \n\n| Step | What Pasteurisation Does | Why It Stops *Campylobacter* (and similar pathogens) |\n|------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Heat exposure** | **HTST**: 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds (standard in the U.S.) <br>**LTLT**: 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fminutes (often used for cheese\u2011making milk) | *Campylobacter jejuni* is **thermosensitive**: a 5\u2011log (100\u202f000\u2011fold) reduction occurs at \u2248\u202f55\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fminutes. The HTST regimen therefore reduces a typical raw\u2011milk load of 10\u2074\u201310\u2075\u202fCFU to **<\u202f1\u202fCFU** per litre\u2014well below an infectious dose (which is \u2248\u202f500\u202fCFU for *Campylobacter*). |\n| **Uniform heating** | Milk is pumped through a plate\u2011heat\u2011exchanger; temperature sensors ensure the entire volume reaches the target temperature for the required time. | Guarantees that even bacteria hidden in fat globules or micro\u2011particles receive the lethal temperature. |\n| **Rapid cooling** | After heating, milk is cooled to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C within seconds. | Prevents any surviving spore\u2011formers from germinating and multiplying. |\n| **Verification** | **Alkaline phosphatase test** (enzyme destroyed by pasteurisation) is performed on every batch; a positive test means the batch fails and must be re\u2011processed. | Provides a built\u2011in safety check that the heat treatment was actually achieved. |\n\nIf the Maine dairy had applied the HTST pasteurisation process:\n\n*",

If ALP is still active, the heat\u2011process was incomplete.\n\n### 1.3  Regulatory standards  \n\n| Jurisdiction | Reference | Maximum allowed ALP activity (post\u2011pasteurisation) |\n|--------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **United States (FSIS/USDA)** | 9\u202fCFR\u202f381.5 | **\u2264\u202f0.02\u202fU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9** (equivalent to \u2264\u202f0.2\u202f\u00b5g\u202fpNP\u202fmin\u207b\u00b9\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9) |\n| **European Union (Regulation (EC) No\u202f853/2004, Annex\u202fIII)** | EU 853/2004 | **\u2264\u202f0.2\u202fU\u202fL\u207b\u00b9** (same numerical value but expressed per litre) |\n| **Canada (CFIA)** | Safe Food for Canadians Regulations, Part\u202fC | **\u2264\u202f0.02\u202fU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9** |\n| **Australia/New\u202fZealand (FSANZ)** | Food Standards Code, Standard\u202f3.5.1 | **\u2264\u202f0.02\u202fU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9** |\n\nAll of these limits are **conservative**: they are set well below the level at which *any* known pathogen could survive the same heat treatment.\n\n### ",
