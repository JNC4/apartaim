      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \n- **Pasteurised milk**: The heat\u2011treatment used in pasteurisation (usually 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201chigh\u2011temperature short\u2011time\u201d, HTST) kills virtually all disease\u2011causing bacteria that may be present in raw milk. This makes pasteurised milk reliably safe for the general population when it is produced, stored and handled correctly.  \n- **Raw milk**: Because it is never heat\u2011treated, any bacteria that were present on the cow, in the udder, in the milking equipment, or that entered the milk after milking can survive. Consequently, raw milk carries a measurable risk of food\u2011borne illness, especially for vulnerable groups (young children, pregnant people, the elderly, and anyone with a weakened immune system).\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based comparison of the safety aspects of the two products.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Cases were identified in **four U.S. states** (Texas, New\u202fMexico, Colorado, and Oklahoma) because the farm sold raw milk to customers across state lines. |\n| **Illness profile** | Typical Campylobacter symptoms: watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and in some patients vomiting. Illness onset was 2\u20135\u202fdays after consumption. |\n| **Investigation & source tracing** | 1. **Epidemiologic link** \u2013 All patients reported drinking raw milk (or a product made from it, such as cheese) from the same farm within the 7\u2011day exposure window.<br>2. **Laboratory confirmation** \u2013 Stool samples from patients yielded *C.\u202fjejuni* with an identical pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern. The same PFGE pattern was recovered from a bulk\u2011tank sample of raw milk collected from the farm.<br>3. **Trace\u2011back** \u2013 The farm\u2019s distribution records showed that the contaminated milk had been shipped to retail outlets, farm\u2011stand sales, and directly to customers via a \u201cmilk\u2011share\u201d program. |\n| **What allowed the bacteria to survive and spread?** | \u2022 **Absence of heat treatment** \u2013 No pasteurisation, so any *Campylobacter* present in the udder, on the teats, or in the milking environment remained viable.<br>\u2022 **Poor udder hygiene** \u2013 The farm\u2019s veterinary inspection later reported **sub\u2011clinical mastitis** in several cows, a known reservoir for *Campylobacter*.

This bacterium is a normal inhabitant of the bovine gastrointestinal tract but can cause severe invasive disease (bacteremia, meningitis, endocarditis) in humans, especially the very young, elderly, or immunocompromised. |\n| **Number of cases** | **35 confirmed cases** (including 5 children <\u202f5\u202fy) and **2 deaths** (both adults, ages 71 and 84). |\n| **Source identified** | **Raw, un\u2011pasteurized whole milk** sold directly to consumers from a single family\u2011run dairy (\u201c**Dairy A**\u201d). The milk was marketed as \u201cfarm\u2011fresh\u201d and distributed through a \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d program and a small on\u2011site retail stand. |\n| **Epidemiologic link** | A case\u2011control questionnaire showed that **87\u202f%** of ill persons (30/35) reported drinking raw milk from Dairy\u202fA, compared with **3\u202f%** of matched community controls.

Fat\u2011soluble vitamins remain stable. | Because milk is not a major source of vitamin\u202fC or thiamine in most diets, the absolute nutritional impact is small. Fortified milks (most commercial products) have vitamin\u202fA and D added back after processing, so the final product meets label claims. |\n| **Minerals (Ca, P, Mg, K, Na, Zn)** | No measurable loss; minerals are heat\u2011stable. | Same \u2013 no loss. | Calcium and phosphorus content stays the same, so bone\u2011health benefits are unchanged. |\n| **Enzymes (e.g., lipase, lactoperoxidase, alkaline phosphatase)** | Inactivated almost completely.

Certain bioactive peptides (e.g., lactoferrin) are partially denatured but still retain activity. | Greater reduction (up to 80\u201190\u202f%). | The clinical relevance for healthy adults is uncertain; infants who are not breast\u2011fed may benefit from higher Ig levels, which is why many health agencies recommend pasteurised donor breast\u2011milk rather than raw cow\u2019s milk for infants. |\n| **Flavor & texture** | Slight \u201ccooked\u201d taste in some varieties, but generally minimal. | Noticeable \u201ccaramelised\u201d notes; longer shelf\u2011life but some consumers perceive a \u201ccooked\u201d flavor. | Mostly a matter of personal preference. |\n\n### Bottom line on nutrition\n*Pasteurisation (especially the standard HT\u2011ST method) removes only a few heat\u2011sensitive vitamins and some enzymes, none of which are essential for the average adult\u2019s diet. The protein, calcium, phosphorus, and most other nutrients remain unchanged.*  \n\nThe modest vitamin losses can be compensated by a balanced diet (fruits, whole grains, fortified foods). In many countries, milk is **fortified** with vitamin\u202fA and D after pasteurisation, so the final product actually contains **more** of those vitamins than raw milk would have.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
