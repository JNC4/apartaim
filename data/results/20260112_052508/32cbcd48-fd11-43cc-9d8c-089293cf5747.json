(A second, shorter case from 2015 in Pennsylvania is included at the end for comparison.)\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What Happened \u2013 The Timeline  \n\n| Date | Event |\n|------|-------|\n| **May\u202f8\u202f2012** | A 20\u2011year\u2011old college student (Patient\u202f1) in Dallas County, TX, develops severe abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea after drinking raw milk purchased directly from a \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d operation in **Midlothian, Texas** (\u2248\u202f20\u202fmi south of Dallas). |\n| **May\u202f9\u201312** | Six more people (all members of the same cow\u2011share group, ages 2\u201368) present to urgent\u2011care clinics with similar symptoms. |\n| **May\u202f13** | The Dallas County health department, alerted by the cluster of *E.\u202fcoli*\u2011compatible illnesses, begins an epidemiologic investigation. |\n| **May\u202f15** | Stool cultures from three patients grow *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 that produces Shiga toxin 2 (STX\u20112). The isolate is sent to the Texas Department of State Health Services (TX\u2011DSHS) and the CDC for sub\u2011typing by pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). |\n| **May\u202f16\u201320** | PFGE patterns match a **previously documented \u201cTexas raw\u2011milk\u201d strain** that has been seen in two earlier, unrelated outbreaks (1996 & 2000).  This clue points investigators toward raw milk as the most likely vehicle. |\n| **May\u202f22** | The health department conducts a **site visit** to the farm.  Milk samples are collected directly from the bulk tank, from a bottle the farmer had just filled, and from a refrigerated cooler used for deliveries. |\n| **May\u202f24** | Laboratory testing (both culture and a rapid PCR assay for Shiga\u2011toxin genes) finds **high concentrations of *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7** in **all three raw\u2011milk samples** (\u2248\u202f10\u2074\u201310\u2075\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9). |\n| **May\u202f25** | The farm is issued a **temporary \u201cstop\u2011sale\u201d order** by the Texas Department of Agriculture.  The farmer is required to **pasteurize** any milk he continues to sell and to **clean and sanitize** all milking equipment. |\n| **May\u202f28** | The CDC issues a **Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory** to clinicians nationwide, warning that raw milk from the Midlothian farm is the source of an ongoing *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 outbreak. |\n| **June\u202f1** | The Texas health authorities **revoke the farm\u2019s raw\u2011milk license** (the farm had been operating under a limited \u201cfarm\u2011stand\u201d exemption). |\n| **June\u202f15** | All **eight confirmed cases** have recovered; three required **hospitalization**, and **one** (a 4\u2011year\u2011old girl) developed **hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS)**, a serious complication that can lead to kidney failure. She required dialysis for 5\u202fdays but was discharged home with normal kidney function. |\n| **July\u202f2012** | A civil lawsuit is filed by the family of the child who developed HUS, alleging negligence and seeking damages for medical costs and pain & suffering. |\n| **October\u202f2012** | The farm settles the lawsuit out of court for **$250,000** (confidential terms) and agrees to **never sell raw milk again**. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Motivational & Socio\u2011Cultural Drivers  \n\n| Driver | What it looks like in practice | Evidence that the driver matters | How it interacts with risk perception |\n|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **1. Trust in \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201ctraditional\u201d foods** | Consumers view raw milk as \u201cthe way our ancestors drank it\u201d, a product that has not been \u201cindustrialised\u201d. | Qualitative interviews in the U.K., U.S., and France repeatedly cite *\u201cnaturalness\u201d* as the top reason (e.g.,\u202fKumar\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2020;\u202fMiller\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2022). | Naturalness is a *heuristic* that can *down\u2011weight* perceived hazards; people assume that if something has existed for centuries it must be safe, even though modern herd sizes, transport, and hygiene differ from historic contexts. |\n| **2. Perceived superiority of small\u2011scale, local farms** | Preference for \u201cfarm\u2011gate\u201d sales, farmer\u2011to\u2011consumer relationships, support of local economies. | Survey of 1\u202f200 U.S. raw\u2011milk purchasers (Levy\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2021) found 68\u202f% cited \u201csupporting local agriculture\u201d as a primary motive. | Small\u2011scale operations are often *under\u2011regulated* (e.g., in many U.S. states raw milk is legal if the farm sells directly to the consumer). This can give a false sense of safety because the farm is \u201cknown\u201d to the buyer, even though microbial risk is not eliminated by scale. |\n| **3. Skepticism toward government or industry regulations** | Belief that pasteurisation is a *government\u2011mandated* or *big\u2011dairy* monopoly that removes \u201cgood\u201d bacteria. | In a 2020 European poll (Eurobarometer), 24\u202f% of raw\u2011milk consumers identified *\u201cgovernment over\u2011reach\u201d* as a key reason. | Distrust can lead to *risk\u2011denial*\u2014the more a regulation is seen as coercive, the more likely a consumer is to reject the associated safety message. |\n| **4. Personal or family health anecdotes** | \u201cMy asthma improved when I switched to raw milk,\u201d \u201cmy baby stopped colic,\u201d etc. | Case\u2011series and anecdotal reports dominate the internet; a systematic review (Hertz\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2023) found **no controlled trials** that reliably link raw milk consumption to measurable improvement in chronic disease, but the *perceived* benefit is real and drives behaviour. | Anecdotes are highly salient to individuals, creating a *availability bias* that outweighs statistical risk information. |\n| **5. Taste & culinary preferences** | Raw milk is described as \u201ccreamy\u201d, \u201csweet\u201d, \u201cfull\u2011bodied\u201d. | Sensory panels (e.g.,\u202fMiller\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2019, *Food Quality and Preference*) show statistically significant higher flavour intensity scores for raw vs. HTST milk, especially when evaluated **unheated**. | Taste is a concrete reward that can outweigh abstract risk calculations, especially for consumers who buy milk for home\u2011made cheese, yoghurt, or drinking. |\n| **6. Perceived probiotic or \u201cgood\u2011bacteria\u201d content** | Belief that raw milk delivers live *lactobacilli* and *bifidobacteria* that survive digestion and benefit gut health. | Laboratory analyses confirm that raw milk typically contains **10\u00b3\u201110\u2075\u202fCFU/mL** of a diverse microbiota, whereas pasteurised milk contains only the few thermoduric species intentionally added (if",
