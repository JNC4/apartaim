      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets\u2014usually government bonds and, sometimes, corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities.  By doing so it tries to achieve three broad goals:\n\n1. **Lower long\u2011term interest rates** (the \u201cportfolio\u2011balance channel\u201d).  \n2. **Raise the price of financial assets** (the \u201cwealth\u2011effect channel\u201d).  \n3. **Signal that the central bank will keep policy accommodative for an extended period** (the \u201cexpectations channel\u201d).\n\nHow these channels feed through to different groups depends on the structure of the economy, the timing of the program, and the pre\u2011existing distribution of wealth and credit.  Below is a synthesis of the main strands of research and the points on which economists still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Households  \n\n| Channel | Typical effect | Who benefits / who loses | Evidence & caveats |\n|---------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Mortgage & consumer\u2011credit rates** | QE pushes down yields on long\u2011term government bonds; banks pass part of the gain onto borrowers via cheaper mortgages, auto loans, credit\u2011card rates. | Borrowers (especially new home\u2011buyers, refinancers). | U.S. studies (e.g., *Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack, 2011*) find a 1\u2011percentage\u2011point fall in the 10\u2011yr Treasury rate reduced mortgage rates by ~0.5\u202fpp.  Impact is larger for households with good credit and smaller for those who already hold low\u2011rate mortgages. |\n| **Wealth effect** | Higher prices of stocks, bonds, and housing increase the net worth of owners. | Asset owners (the top 20\u201130\u202f% of the wealth distribution). | *Bivens (2015)* shows QE\u2011related equity price gains contributed about 1\u20112\u202fpp of U.S. GDP growth, but the gains were highly concentrated.  Households without financial assets see little direct benefit. |\n| **Employment & wages** | Lower financing costs can stimulate business investment and, through higher demand, raise employment. | Workers in sectors that expand (construction, services). | The macro link is modest; IMF \u201cQE and the labour market\u201d (2020) notes a 0.1\u20110.3\u202f% rise in employment per 100\u2011bp cut in long\u2011term rates, with large cross\u2011country variation. |\n| **Inflation expectations** | If QE succeeds in raising expected inflation, real wages can improve for low\u2011income earners whose wages are sticky upward. | Potentially low\u2011income workers. | Empirical work (e.g., *Kuttner, 2018*) finds only a small upward shift in inflation expectations after major QE rounds, limiting this channel. |\n| **Currency depreciation** | QE often weakens the domestic currency, making imports more expensive. | Consumers of imported goods, especially low\u2011income households with tight budgets. | In the euro\u2011area, QE contributed to a 5\u201110\u202f% euro depreciation (ECB, 2017).  The net effect on household purchasing power is ambiguous because export\u2011led growth can raise wages later. |\n\n### Bottom line for households\n- **Direct financial\u2011cost relief** (lower mortgage/loan rates) tends to be broadly distributed, though the biggest borrowers benefit most.\n- **Wealth gains** are highly skewed toward the already\u2011wealthy because they hold most equities and housing assets.\n- **Income effects** (jobs, wages) are modest and lagged; the distribution depends on which sectors expand.\n- **Potential downside**: higher import prices and, if QE fuels asset bubbles, future busts could hurt savers and first\u2011time buyers.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Lower long\u2011term interest rates** | The Fed (or ECB, BoJ, etc.) buys government bonds \u2192 yields on 10\u2011yr Treasuries fall. | Cheaper financing for mortgage borrowers, developers, and businesses. | **Positive:** <br>\u2022 New construction becomes less costly \u2192 more apartments can be built \u2192 upward pressure on supply \u2192 slower rent growth.<br>**Negative:** <br>\u2022 Existing homeowners refinance at lower rates and have more disposable income, which can increase demand for rental units (e.g., a homeowner who now can afford a larger home may move out of a modest rental). | *Rognlie (2018)* finds a 100\u2011bp fall in the 10\u2011yr Treasury rate lowers average U.S. rents by about 0.3\u202f% after 2\u20113\u202fyears, mainly through the construction channel. The effect is modest because supply responses are slow. |\n| **2. Portfolio\u2011balance / wealth effect** | QE pushes up prices of stocks, corporate bonds, and housing. | Households that own these assets feel richer and may spend more. | **Positive:** <br>\u2022 Higher consumer confidence can boost demand for services, raising employment and wages for renters.<br>**Negative:** <br>\u2022 Wealthier owners may bid up housing prices, which can spill over into higher rents if landlords raise rents to reflect higher property values. | *Bivens (2015)* shows that a large part of the U.S. GDP boost from QE came from \u201cwealth effects.\u201d  The rent\u2011impact side is smaller and highly location\u2011specific (see point\u202f1). |\n| **3. Credit\u2011market easing** | Banks have more high\u2011quality assets (the bonds bought by the central bank) and are willing to lend at lower rates. | Consumer\u2011credit (auto, credit\u2011card) and small\u2011business loan rates fall. | **Positive:** <br>\u2022 Renters can borrow cheaper to pay a security deposit, furnish a new place, or cover a temporary cash\u2011flow gap.<br>**Negative:** <br>\u2022 Easier credit can fuel a broader credit\u2011boom that later leads to higher inflation, which erodes real wages. | U.S. data (Fed *Financial Stability Report*, 2020) show a 30\u2011bp decline in average auto\u2011loan rates after QE\u20112020, saving a typical renter $150\u2011$200 per year on a $10\u202fk auto loan. |\n| **4. Expectations / signaling** | The central bank announces that rates will stay low for an extended period. | Markets expect a prolonged low\u2011rate environment and moderate inflation. | **Positive:** <br>\u2022 Businesses feel more confident to expand, hire, and raise wages\u2014benefiting renters in the labor market.<br>**Negative:** <br>\u2022 If inflation expectations rise faster than wages, renters\u2019 real purchasing power falls. | IMF (2020) notes that in advanced economies QE raised inflation expectations by ~0.2\u202fpp.  In most cases wages kept pace, but low\u2011skill renters sometimes lagged. |\n| **5. Currency depreciation** | Large\u2011scale asset purchases can weaken the domestic currency. | Imported goods become more expensive. | **Negative:** <br>\u2022 Higher food, clothing, and energy prices bite renters proportionally more because they spend a larger share of income on necessities.<br>**Positive (indirect):** <br>\u2022 A weaker currency can boost export\u2011oriented jobs, helping renters in those sectors. | Euro\u2011area QE (2015\u20112019) led to a 7\u201110\u202f% euro depreciation (ECB, 2020).
