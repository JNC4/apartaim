      "unknown_model_response": "**1. Why doctors (and public\u2011health agencies) recommend childhood vaccinations**\n\n| Reason | What it means in practice | Key evidence |\n|--------|--------------------------|--------------|\n| **Prevention of serious disease** | Vaccines protect children from infections that can cause fever, pneumonia, meningitis, paralysis, long\u2011term disability, or death. | \u2022 The U.S. CDC estimates that the 13\u2011vaccine childhood schedule prevents >\u202f42\u202fmillion illnesses, 20\u202fmillion medical visits, 500\u202f000 hospitalizations and 12\u202f000 deaths each year in the United States alone (CDC, 2023).  <br>\u2022 Global data show a >\u202f99\u202f% drop in measles deaths since 2000 after widespread immunisation (WHO, 2022). |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | When a high proportion of children are immune, the virus has fewer opportunities to spread, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants, immunocompromised patients). | \u2022 Modelling studies demonstrate that \u2265\u202f95\u202f% coverage for measles is needed to keep the effective reproduction number (R\u2091) below 1, eliminating sustained transmission (Keeling & Rohani, 2011). |\n| **Economic and societal benefits** | Fewer sick days for families, lower health\u2011care costs, and reduced strain on schools and workplaces. | \u2022 A 2018 cost\u2011effectiveness analysis found that the routine U.S. childhood schedule yields a net societal benefit of $1.38\u202ftrillion over a cohort\u2019s lifetime (Zhou et\u202fal., 2018). |\n| **Eradication or control of diseases** | Sustained high coverage can lead to the disappearance of a disease from a region or the world. | \u2022 Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 after a global vaccination campaign (CDC, 2020). <br>\u2022 Polio cases have fallen >\u202f99.9\u202f% since the 1980s (WHO, 2023). |\n| **Predictable, regulated protection** | Unlike natural infection, a vaccine gives a known dose of antigen without the full disease burden. | \u2022 Clinical\u2011trial data show that the risk of severe disease after vaccination is orders of magnitude lower than after natural infection (e.g., varicella: 1 severe case per\u202f\u2248\u202f10\u202f000 vaccine doses vs. 1 per\u202f\u2248\u202f100 infections) (Gershon et\u202fal., 2015). |\n\n**2. How vaccine safety is evaluated**\n\n| Stage | What happens | Typical sample size / duration |\n|-------|--------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Pre\u2011clinical (animal) testing** | Toxicology, immunogenicity, dose\u2011range finding. | Multiple species, weeks\u2011months. |\n| **Phase\u202fI trials** | Small groups (\u2248\u202f20\u2013100) of healthy adults/children; focus on safety and immune response. | Days\u2011weeks. |\n| **Phase\u202fII trials** | Hundreds of participants; refine dose, schedule, and monitor for common side\u2011effects. | Weeks\u2011months. |\n| **Phase\u202fIII trials** | Thousands (often >\u202f10\u202f000) of participants; compare vaccine to placebo or existing vaccine for efficacy and rare adverse events. | Follow\u2011up for 2\u202f\u2013\u202f6\u202fmonths (or longer for diseases with delayed onset). |\n| **Regulatory review**",

Why\u202fmost paediatric physicians recommend the routine childhood\u2011vaccination schedule  \n\n| Reason (doctor\u2011focused) | What the evidence shows | How it fits into the overall public\u2011health picture |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Prevention of serious, often fatal disease** | Large\u2011scale epidemiologic data show that diseases that once caused millions of deaths worldwide (e.g., measles, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus\u202finfluenzae type\u202fb) have been reduced by >\u202f99\u202f% in countries with high vaccine coverage.  <br>*Example*: In the United States, measles cases fell from ~\u202f500\u202f000 annually in the 1960s to <\u202f150\u202fcases total in 2023, despite the virus still circulating globally. | Preventing these illnesses protects the individual child *and* reduces the pool of susceptible hosts, limiting outbreaks. |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | Mathematical models and real\u2011world data demonstrate that when \u2265\u202f90\u201395\u202f% of a population is immunised against measles, the effective reproduction number (R\u2091) falls below\u202f1, so transmission chains die out.  <br>*Example*: The 2019\u20112020 measles resurgence in the U.S. was concentrated in communities with <\u202f80\u202f% coverage. | Even children who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., those with severe immunodeficiency) are protected because the pathogen cannot find enough susceptible hosts. |\n| **Cost\u2011effectiveness and health\u2011system stability** | Economic analyses (e.g., CDC\u2019s \u201cBenefits of Immunization\u201d 2022 report) estimate that the U.S. childhood immunisation program saves **\u2248\u202f$13\u202fbillion** annually in direct medical costs and **\u2248\u202f$68\u202fbillion** in societal costs (lost productivity, long\u2011term disability). | By avoiding hospitalisations and chronic sequelae, vaccines free up resources for other health priorities. |\n| **Protection of future health and development** | Some vaccine\u2011preventable infections cause irreversible damage (e.g., congenital rubella syndrome, cerebral palsy after severe pertussis, hearing loss after meningitis).  Longitudinal cohort studies show that children who avoid these infections have better neuro\u2011cognitive outcomes and school performance. | The benefits accrue far beyond the immediate avoidance of acute illness. |\n| **Alignment with evidence\u2011based guidelines** | The **U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)**, **World Health Organization (WHO)**, **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)**, and >\u202f130\u202fnational immunisation technical advisory groups base their schedules on systematic reviews of randomized trials, cohort studies, and post\u2011marketing safety surveillance. | Doctors follow these guidelines because they synthesize the totality of high\u2011quality data. |\n\n> **Bottom\u2011line (scientific consensus)** \u2013 All major paediatric and public\u2011health organisations worldwide **strongly endorse** the current childhood\u2011vaccination schedule as the most effective, safest, and most economical way to protect children from vaccine\u2011preventable diseases.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.
