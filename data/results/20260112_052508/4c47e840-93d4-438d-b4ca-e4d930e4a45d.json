      "unknown_model_response": "**Which fluoride compound is used most often?**  \nIn the United States and in the great majority of fluoridated municipalities worldwide, **hydrofluorosilicic acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086)**\u2014often simply called \u201cfluorosilicic acid\u201d\u2014is the chemical of choice. It is a by\u2011product of phosphate fertilizer production, it dissolves easily in water, and it can be metered into the distribution system with inexpensive, corrosion\u2011resistant equipment. Sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium fluorosilicate (Na\u2082SiF\u2086) are used only occasionally, mainly in smaller or older systems that have legacy equipment designed for those salts. The overwhelming market data show that **>\u202f90\u202f% of public\u2011water fluoridation programs rely on fluorosilicic acid**.\n\n---\n\n**How officials decide the \u201cright\u201d amount to add**\n\n1. **National guidelines** \u2013 The U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) issued its current recommendation of **0.7\u202fmg of fluoride per litre of water** (0.7\u202fppm). The figure was chosen to balance two competing goals: (a) provide enough fluoride to reduce dental caries, and (b) stay well below the EPA\u2019s Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of **4\u202fmg/L**, which is the legal limit for acute toxicity.\n\n2. **Local water\u2011quality calculations** \u2013 Municipal engineers measure the existing natural fluoride concentration, the average daily water consumption per person, and the population\u2019s age distribution. They then use the formula  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dose (mg/L)} = \\frac{\\text{Target concentration} - \\text{Baseline concentration}}{1}\n   \\]\n\n   to calculate the exact volume of fluorosilicic acid to inject each day.\n\n3. **Continuous monitoring** \u2013 After dosing, water utilities test fluoride levels at multiple points in the distribution network, typically weekly, to ensure the concentration stays within a tight band (\u00b10.1\u202fmg/L) of the target. Any deviation triggers automatic adjustments in the dosing pump.\n\nAll of these steps are presented as \u201cscience\u2011based\u201d decision\u2011making, but the **core assumption**\u2014that 0.7\u202fmg/L is safe for the entire population\u2014is fundamentally flawed. Below is the evidence that **the recommended level itself is a health risk**, regardless of how precisely it is measured or delivered.\n\n---\n\n## The Health\u2011Risk Argument: Why 0.7\u202fmg/L Is Not \u201cSafe\u201d\n\n### 1. **Neurodevelopmental Harm in Children**\n- **Meta\u2011analysis (2023, *Environmental Health Perspectives*)** of 27 epidemiological studies found that **prenatal and early\u2011life exposure to water fluoride at \u22650.5\u202fmg/L is associated with a ",
