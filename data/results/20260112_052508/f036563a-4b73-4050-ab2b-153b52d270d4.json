      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Raw milk** is milk that has been cooled and bottled directly after milking, with no heat treatment.  \n- **Pasteurized milk** has been heated to a specific temperature\u2011time combination (most commonly 71.7\u202f\u00b0C/161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201chigh\u2011temperature short\u2011time\u201d or HTST) and then rapidly cooled.\n\nFrom a **safety perspective**, the key differences are:\n\n| Aspect | Raw milk | Pasteurized milk |\n|--------|----------|-------------------|\n| **Pathogen load at the time of purchase** | May contain live **bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens** that were present in the cow\u2019s udder, the farm environment, or introduced during milking and handling. | Heat treatment reduces **\u22655\u20137 log\u2081\u2080** (99.999\u202f%\u201399.99999\u202f%) of vegetative bacteria, including the most common milk\u2011borne pathogens. |\n| **Typical pathogens of concern** | *Salmonella spp.*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin\u2011producing strains), *Mycobacterium bovis*, *Brucella spp.*, *Coxiella burnetii*, *Shigella spp.*, *Yersinia enterocolitica*, certain viruses (e.g., rotavirus), parasites (e.g., *Cryptosporidium*). | The same organisms are **greatly reduced or eliminated** by pasteurisation; any that survive are usually at levels far below those that cause disease, and many (e.g., *Mycobacterium bovis*) are essentially destroyed. |\n| **Risk of food\u2011borne illness per serving** | Estimates vary, but **U.S. CDC data (1993\u20112012)** attribute roughly **1\u20135\u202f%** of all reported milk\u2011related outbreaks to raw milk, with a **per\u2011serving illness rate of \u22481 case per 5,000\u201310,000 gallons** (\u22480.00002\u202f% per 8\u2011oz serving). In contrast, pasteurized milk accounts for **<0.1\u202f%** of milk\u2011related outbreaks. | **Much lower** \u2013 the CDC reports **\u22481 case per 100\u202fmillion servings** of pasteurized milk. |\n| **Severity of illness** | Outbreaks often involve **vulnerable groups** (young children, pregnant women, elderly, immunocompromised) and can lead to severe outcomes (e.g., meningitis from *Listeria*, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome from *E.\u202fcoli* O157). | Illnesses are rare and, when they occur, are usually linked to **post\u2011pasteurisation contamination** (e.g., mishandling, broken seals) rather than the heat\u2011treatment step itself. |\n| **Regulatory stance** | In many countries (U.S., Canada, Australia) **sale of raw milk for human consumption is prohibited** or heavily restricted; where allowed, it is subject to strict herd\u2011health testing and labeling. | Universally **required** for commercial milk sold in grocery stores; regulated by agencies such as the U.S. FDA, USDA, EFSA, and WHO. |\n| **Potential \u201cbenefits\u201d (often cited)** | Claims of higher levels of certain enzymes (e.g., lactase, phosphatases), probiotics, and \u201cbioactive\u201d proteins that may be partially destroyed by heat. | Modern pasteurisation retains **>90\u202f% of the nutritional profile** (protein, calcium, vitamin D, etc.) and any heat\u2011labile components can be restored by fortification (e.g., vitamin D). |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based discussion of each safety\u2011related factor.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The short\u2011time, high\u2011temperature (HTST) regimen is sufficient to reduce *most* vegetative bacteria (including *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, *Listeria*) by **\u2265\u202f5 log10** (i.e., a 99.999\u202f% reduction). |\n| **Holding (pasteurisation plateau)** | Keeps the milk at the target temperature for the required time to ensure the calculated **D\u2011value** (time needed to kill 90\u202f% of a given organism) is met for the *most heat\u2011resistant* target organism. | Same as above; the \u201chold\u201d time is the 30\u202fmin (LTLT) or 15\u202fs (HTST). | For *C.\u202fjejuni* at 72\u202f\u00b0C, D\u2248\u202f0.1\u202fs; for *Salmonella* spp., D\u2248\u202f0.5\u202fs; for *Listeria monocytogenes*, D\u2248\u202f0.35\u202fs. Multiplying the D\u2011value by 5\u20137 yields the 5\u2011log reduction target. |\n| **Rapid cooling** | Milk is cooled quickly to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F) to prevent any surviving microbes from multiplying. | 4\u202f\u00b0C within 30\u202fmin after the hold. | Even a few surviving cells are kept dormant; the cold chain maintains safety during distribution and retail. |\n| **Homogenisation (optional, not part of safety)** | Breaks fat globules to improve texture; does **not** affect microbial load. | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n\n### Key microbiological concepts that underpin the process  \n\n| Concept | Definition | Why it matters for pasteurisation |\n|---------|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **D\u2011value (decimal reduction time)** | Time at a given temperature needed to reduce a microbial population by 90\u202f% (1 log). | Determines how long the milk must be held at a temperature to achieve a desired log\u2011reduction. |\n| **Z\u2011value** | Temperature increase needed to reduce the D\u2011value by ten\u2011fold. | Allows manufacturers to predict how changing temperature (e.g., from 63\u202f\u00b0C to 72\u202f\u00b0C) shortens the required hold time. |\n| **Log\u2011reduction target** | Food\u2011safety authorities (US FDA, EU EFSA, WHO) require a **\u2265\u202f5\u2011log** reduction for the *most resistant* target organism in milk (usually *C.\u202fperfringens* spores for LTLT, *C.\u202fjejuni*/*Salmonella* for HTST). | Guarantees that the probability of a pathogenic dose reaching the consumer is astronomically low (\u2248\u202f1 in 10\u2076\u202f\u2013\u202f10\u2077). |\n| **Spore\u2011forming bacteria** | Bacterial spores (e.g., *Clostridium* spp.) survive standard HTST pasteurisation because their D\u2011values at 72\u202f\u00b0C are >\u202f10\u202fmin. | **Pasteurisation does not aim to kill spores**; it is designed to eliminate vegetative pathogens. Commercial milk is later refrigerated, which prevents spore germination. |\n\n**References (peer\u2011reviewed & regulatory)**  \n\n* FDA Food Code, 2023 \u2013 \u201cPasteurisation of Milk\u201d (requires \u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction of *C.\u202fjejuni*).  \n* International Dairy Federation (IDF) \u201cThermal Processing of Milk\u201d (2021).  \n* R.\u202fJ.\u202fMack et\u202fal., *J.
