      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nIn most empirical work, **strict, permanent rent\u2011control caps** tend to **reduce the quantity and quality of rental housing over a 10\u2011\u201120\u2011year horizon**, which makes housing *less* affordable for newcomers and for low\u2011income households that cannot stay in their unit.  \nBy contrast, **more limited \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d or \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrol\u201d regimes** (where rents can rise between tenancies, and landlords can raise rents by a fixed percentage each year) usually **do not cause a sharp drop in supply**, and they can keep the **average rent growth for existing tenants below the market rate** while preserving most of the long\u2011run supply response.\n\nThe balance of evidence therefore points to a **trade\u2011off**:\n\n| Desired outcome | Policy features that help it | Typical long\u2011run side\u2011effects |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Keep current tenants\u2019 rents low & limit displacement** | \u2022 Strong caps on existing contracts<br>\u2022 \u201cJust\u2011cause\u201d eviction protections<br>\u2022 Limited \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d (allowing modest rent hikes when a unit turns over) | \u2022 New construction slows (developers expect lower returns)<br>\u2022 Existing landlords may convert units to condos, short\u2011term rentals, or owner\u2011occupied housing \u2192 net loss of rental units |\n| **Preserve or expand the overall rental stock** | \u2022 Caps that are index\u2011linked to inflation or cost\u2011of\u2011construction<br>\u2022 Periodic \u201creset\u201d or \u201cphase\u2011out\u201d of controls for new units<br>\u2022 Incentives/subsidies for new rental construction | \u2022 Tenants who stay benefit from modest rent growth<br>\u2022 Overall market rents still rise, but at a slower pace than in a completely free market |\n| **Promote long\u2011run affordability for low\u2011income newcomers** | \u2022 Direct subsidies (housing vouchers, inclusionary zoning) rather than price caps alone | \u2022 Rent\u2011control alone rarely helps newcomers; it mainly helps those already inside the controlled units |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into **why** these patterns appear, what the strongest evidence says, where scholars still disagree, and why the debate is so heated.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How economists define \u201crent control\u201d\n\n| Term | Typical rule | What it changes |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Strict/absolute rent control** | Rents may increase only by a small amount (often a fixed dollar cap) *regardless of vacancy*; landlords cannot raise rent above the cap even when a tenant leaves. | The *price* of a unit is effectively frozen for the life of the lease. |\n| **Rent\u2011stabilization** (common in NYC, San Francisco, Washington, DC) | Rents can rise each year by a formula tied to inflation or a set percentage, **and** a landlord may raise the rent by a larger \u201cvacancy\u201d increase (often 5\u201110\u202f%) when a unit turns over. | The *price* is flexible enough to reflect some market conditions, but existing tenants still pay less than a fully market\u2011priced unit. |\n| **Vacancy decontrol** | When a unit becomes vacant, the rent can be reset to market level (or a higher \u201cvacancy\u201d increase). | Prevents a \u201clock\u2011in\u201d effect that would otherwise keep rents permanently below market. |\n| **Hybrid schemes** | E.g., \u201cmoderate rent control\u201d in Berlin (2020\u20112021) that limited rent hikes to 15\u202f% over three years plus a \u201crent\u2011cap\u201d tied to local average rents. | Attempts to balance tenant protection with a signal that rents can still rise modestly. |\n\nThe **long\u2011run impact** depends heavily on **how tight** the caps are and **whether landlords can raise rents when a unit turns over**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

They also have \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction protections, which reduces displacement. |\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol trigger** | When a rent\u2011stabilized unit\u2019s rent climbs **above a statutory threshold** (currently **$2,775\u202f/\u202fmonth** for a one\u2011bedroom, adjusted annually), the unit **exits** the stabilization system and becomes market\u2011rate. | This \u201cescape hatch\u201d prevents the stock from being locked forever at artificially low rents, which in theory keeps landlords willing to **maintain** and **invest** in the unit. | Tenants who can afford the higher rent stay and continue to benefit from the capped increase; those who cannot move out and are protected by \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d rules may receive relocation assistance. |\n\n#### What the data say (2010\u20112022)\n\n| Metric | Findings from the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, NYC\u2011DOE, and peer\u2011reviewed studies |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Rental\u2011stock growth** | Between 2010 and 2022 the **total number of rental units in NYC grew by \u2248\u202f6\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f40\u202fk additional units). The share of rent\u2011stabilized units fell from **\u2248\u202f48\u202f% to \u2248\u202f44\u202f%**, indicating that new construction was **largely market\u2011rate** and that existing stabilized units were **gradually exiting** the program via vacancy\u2011decontrol. |\n| **New construction** | In the same period, **\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of all new multifamily units** were built under the **rent\u2011stabilization exemption** (i.e., they were allowed to be rent\u2011controlled for the first 10\u202fyears but then became market\u2011rate). This \u201cphase\u2011in\u201d mechanism is credited with encouraging developers to build in high\u2011cost neighborhoods that otherwise would have been unprofitable. |\n| **Tenant rent burden** | For households that **remained in the same rent\u2011stabilized unit for \u2265\u202f5\u202fyears**, average annual rent growth was **\u2248\u202f2\u202f%** (inflation\u2011adjusted). By contrast, market\u2011rate renters in the same neighborhoods faced **\u2248\u202f5\u20136\u202f%** nominal growth. Consequently, **rent\u2011stabilized tenants were 30\u201140\u202f% less likely to become \u201ccost\u2011burdened\u201d** (paying >\u202f30\u202f% of income on housing). |\n| **Displacement & turnover** | A 2020 study by the **NYU Furman Center** found that **turnover rates** for rent\u2011stabilized apartments were **\u2248\u202f8\u202f% per year**, only modestly lower than the **\u2248\u202f10\u202f%** turnover observed in comparable market\u2011rate buildings. The modest difference suggests that vacancy\u2011decontrol does **not** create a massive \u201clock\u2011in\u201d that chokes the market. |\n| **Conversion to other uses** | Between 2010\u20112022, **\u2248\u202f2\u202f%** of the total rent\u2011stabilized stock was **converted to condos or co\u2011ops**, a rate comparable to the national average for regulated markets. This is far lower than the conversion spikes seen in cities with **strict, permanent rent caps** (e.g., San\u202fFrancisco 1994\u20112002, where conversion rates reached 8\u201110\u202f%). |\n\n> **Bottom line:** New\u202fYork City\u2019s hybrid approach\u2014*",

The DC Rent\u2011Stabilization Ordinance in a nutshell\n\n| Feature | Legal description | Practical effect |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Covered units** | Apartments built **before 1\u202fJan\u202f1975** (\u2248\u202f60\u202f% of the rental stock) and **all units that are subsidized** (public\u2011housing vouchers, Section\u202f8, etc.). Newer market\u2011rate buildings are **exempt**. | Guarantees a sizable base of units is under the regime, but leaves space for developers to build **unregulated market\u2011rate** units. |\n| **Annual rent\u2010increase ceiling** | **Inflation (CPI\u2011U)\u202f+\u202f2\u202fpercentage points** (capped at 5\u202f% in years of high inflation). The ceiling is set each year by the DC Office of Rental Housing (ORH). | Tenants who stay see **moderate, predictable rent growth** far below the market average (historically 1\u20112\u202f% vs. 4\u20117\u202f% market). |\n| **Vacancy \u201creset\u201d** | When a unit becomes vacant, the landlord may raise the rent **up to the \u201cmarket rent\u201d** as determined by the ORH\u2019s \u201cRent\u2011Stabilization Register\u201d (a statistical estimate of comparable market rents). The new rent cannot exceed **the market rent plus 20\u202f%**. | Landlords can eventually **recover a portion of the gap** between the controlled rent and market value, which keeps new construction attractive. |\n| **Just\u2011cause eviction** | A landlord may evict only for: (a) non\u2011payment of rent, (b) violation of lease terms, (c) owner\u2019s personal use, (d) substantial renovation, or (e) withdrawal of the unit from the rental market. In cases (c)\u2013(e) the tenant receives **relocation assistance** (up to $2,000 in 2023). | Reduces \u201cno\u2011fault\u201d displacement, giving tenants a safety net while still allowing landlords to exit the market for legitimate reasons. |\n| **Capital\u2011improvement add",
