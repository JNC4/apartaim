The same template is used for virtually every other commercial GM crop, so the example illustrates the whole process.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What MON\u202f810 is\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Trait** | Production of the Cry1Ab protein, a toxin that kills several lepidopteran (caterpillar) pests (e.g., *European corn borer*). |\n| **Genetic construct** | A single\u2011copy insert containing the *cry1Ab* gene from *Bacillus thuringiensis* driven by a maize\u2011specific promoter (CaMV 35S\u2011like). The insertion site is on chromosome\u202f5, in a non\u2011coding region. |\n| **Commercial name** | Often marketed as \u201cBt\u202fcorn\u201d (e.g., by Monsanto/Bayer, Syngenta, Pioneer). |\n| **First regulatory approval** | 1996 (USA), 1998 (EU), 1998 (Canada). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Molecular characterization** | \u2022 Sequencing of the insert and 1\u202fkb flanking regions.  <br>\u2022 Southern blot & PCR confirmed a single\u2011copy insertion, no vector backbone residues.  <br>\u2022 Whole\u2011genome resequencing (later studies, 2015\u20112020) showed no off\u2011target mutations. | The inserted DNA is fully known; the only novel open reading frame is *cry1Ab*. No unintended genes were created. |\n| **B. Comparative compositional analysis** | \u2022 10\u202ffield trials in the U.S., EU, and Canada, each comparing MON\u202f810 to its near\u2011isogenic non\u2011GM counterpart grown side\u2011by\u2011side.  <br>\u2022 Measured ~90 constituents (proximate analysis, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, antinutrients, mycotoxins). | No statistically or biologically significant differences were observed for any nutrient or anti\u2011nutrient. The composition fell within the natural variability range of conventional maize. |\n| **C. Allergenicity assessment** | \u2022 In\u2011silico comparison of Cry1Ab amino\u2011acid sequence to all known plant and animal allergens (AllergenOnline, WHO/IUIS).  <br>\u2022 Cry1Ab shown to be rapidly degraded in simulated gastric fluid (half\u2011life <\u202f2\u202fmin).  <br>\u2022 No IgE binding detected in sera from individuals allergic to maize or related proteins. | Cry1Ab lacks homology to known allergens and is digested quickly, meeting the \u201cno\u2011allergen\u201d criteria. |\n| **D.

Endpoints (body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry, pathology) were indistinguishable from the control diet.  <br>\u2022 **Genotoxicity**: Ames test (five *Salmonella* strains) and in\u2011vitro micronucleus assay \u2013 both negative. | Across all standard toxicology assays, Cry1Ab and the whole grain showed no evidence of toxicity. |\n| **E.
