      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control policies lower the rents that protected tenants pay in the short run, but over a period of 10\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202fyears they tend to *reduce overall housing affordability* for the broader market. The main channels are a slower growth (or net loss) of rental\u2011unit supply, lower investment in new construction and maintenance, and a shift of housing stock toward higher\u2011priced \u201cluxury\u201d or owner\u2011occupied units.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the most robust evidence, the mechanisms that drive it, and the conditions under which the outcomes can differ.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Mechanisms behind the long\u2011term effects\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|----------|\n| **Reduced incentive to build new rentals** | Developers expect lower returns because future rents are capped or can only rise with inflation. | Gyourko & Linn (2020); Diamond et\u202fal. (2019) \u2013 new construction fell 20\u201130\u202f% in cities with strict caps. |\n| **Conversion to other uses** | Owners switch apartments to condos, hotel rooms, or short\u2011term rentals where caps do not apply.",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer** \u2013  The pre\u2011ponderance of rigorous, peer\u2011reviewed research (especially the work of professional economists) finds that **strict, long\u2011run rent\u2011control regimes tend to reduce the overall stock of rental housing, raise rents for non\u2011controlled units, and therefore *hurt* housing affordability for the city as a whole**.  \nHowever, the magnitude of those effects, the groups that are most harmed or helped, and the conditions under which rent control can be less damaging or even partially beneficial are still debated.  Below is a systematic, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through that shows where consensus lies, where the literature disagrees, and which points are often missed or misunderstood.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical baseline (what the models predict)\n\n| Mechanism | Expected long\u2011run impact on affordability | What the theory assumes |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Supply\u2011side constraint** \u2013 landlords can charge only a capped rent. | **\u2193 new construction** (lower expected return on investment) \u2192 **\u2193 rental\u2011unit stock** \u2192 **\u2191 market rents** for uncovered units. | Competitive housing market; profit motive; no compensating subsidies. |\n| **Conversion incentive** \u2013 owners may switch from renting to ownership or to higher\u2011margin uses (e.g., short\u2011term rentals, condos). | **\u2193 rental supply** + **\u2191 home\u2011price pressure** \u2192 **greater cost of entry** for renters. | Transaction costs are low enough to make conversion profitable. |\n| **Maintenance/quality effect** \u2013 capped cash flow reduces funds for upkeep. | **\u2193 unit quality** \u2192 **higher turnover costs, lower tenant welfare**; may indirectly raise \u201ceffective rent\u201d (cost of moving, lost utility). | Landlords are profit\u2011maximizers; no mandatory quality standards. |\n| **Tenant\u2011stability benefit** \u2013 existing renters pay less than market price, avoid moving costs. | **\u2191 stability for a subset of renters** (often mid\u2011income, long\u2011term tenants). | Rent caps are binding for those units; no \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d that lets rents rise after turnover. |\n| **Spill\u2011over (price\u2011elasticity) effect** \u2013 landlords raise rents on uncontrolled units to recoup lost income. | **\u2191 rents for non\u2011controlled units** \u2192 **affects new entrants and low\u2011income renters**. | Elastic demand for rentals; landlords can discriminate. |\n\n*Key takeaway*: The **core consensus** among economists (see Glaeser & Luttmer 2003; Sims 2022; IMF 2022 Working Paper) is that **the supply\u2011side and spill\u2011over mechanisms dominate over the tenant\u2011stability benefit in the long run**, yielding net higher city\u2011wide rents.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "### A \u201csuccess story\u201d \u2013 Vienna, Austria  \n\n| What Vienna does | Why it matters for the rent\u2011control debate |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Large, publicly\u2011owned housing stock** \u2013 about **60\u202f%** of all dwellings are owned by the city or by non\u2011profit housing associations (the \u201cGemeindebau\u201d). | The sheer volume of non\u2011market units means that the rent\u2011control regime applies to a *minority* of the total housing market, so the overall supply is not squeezed. |\n| **Regulated rents on the public\u2011sector units** \u2013 rents are set by a formula that ties them to construction cost, inflation, and the size/quality of the apartment. The formula allows modest, predictable increases (often 1\u20112\u202f%\u202f/\u202fyr). | Tenants in these units enjoy long\u2011term affordability, and landlords have a clear, transparent signal that they will recover a portion of their investment over time, reducing the incentive to convert the units to higher\u2011priced uses. |\n| **Active \u201cnew\u2011construction\u201d policy** \u2013 the city mandates that every new residential building must set aside **\u2248\u202f20\u202f%** of its units for \u201csocial\u2011housing\u201d (often financed through low\u2011interest municipal bonds). | This supply\u2011side \u201coffset\u201d prevents the market from being starved of new units, a problem that most pure\u2011rent\u2011control regimes encounter. |\n| **Strong tenant\u2011rights framework** \u2013 \u201cjust cause\u201d eviction rules, a mandatory mediation board, and a tenant\u2011association network. | Guarantees that rent caps are not circumvented by frequent turnover or \u201crenovation evictions.\u201d |\n| **Outcome (2022\u20112023 data)** \u2013 Median rent for a two\u2011bedroom apartment in Vienna was **\u2248\u202f9\u202f% of disposable household income**, compared with **\u2248\u202f16\u202f%** in Berlin, **\u2248\u202f20\u202f%** in Paris, and **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** in London. New\u2011construction rates (new dwellings per 1\u202f000 inhabitants) were **\u2248\u202f6.8**, well above the EU average of **\u2248\u202f5.1**. | The combination of modest rent growth and a growing stock keeps housing affordable for a broad cross\u2011section of residents, not just those lucky enough to be in a rent\u2011controlled unit. |\n\n#### Why Vienna\u2019s experience is *not* a pure rent\u2011control case\n- **Rent control is limited to the public\u2011sector stock** (\u2248\u202f60\u202f% of dwellings). The remaining private\u2011rental market is largely unregulated, but it is constrained by the city\u2019s \u201cquota\u201d rules that force developers to produce affordable units.\n- **The rent\u2011control formula is transparent and indexed to costs**; landlords can earn a reasonable return over the long horizon, so they rarely convert units to condos or short\u2011term rentals.\n- **Complementary policies are massive** \u2013 generous subsidies for new social housing, low\u2011interest municipal bonds, and a robust public\u2011housing construction program. Without these, the rent caps alone would have produced the usual supply\u2011side drag.\n\n#### The broader lesson for other cities\n1. **Rent control works best when it is a *component* of a wider housing strategy**, not the sole instrument.  \n2. **Couple caps with a guaranteed pipeline of new affordable units.** Vienna\u2019s 20\u202f% \u201csocial\u2011housing quota\u201d on all new projects is",
