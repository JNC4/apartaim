What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Component | Typical design (U.S. and other countries) | Variations |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Funding source** | Municipal, state, or federal budget; sometimes private foundations or NGOs. | Some programs are funded by \u201cpenny\u2011a\u2011day\u201d taxes, police department budgets, or corporate sponsorship. |\n| **Eligibility** | Usually **any** legally owned firearm (handgun, rifle, shotgun) can be turned in, regardless of whether the owner has a criminal record. | Some programs restrict to handguns, or to firearms of a certain caliber, or exclude firearms that are already illegal (e.g., fully automatic weapons). |\n| **Incentive** | Cash or gift\u2011card vouchers per firearm (often $50\u2011$200 per gun). | Some jurisdictions offer higher payments for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles) or for multiple guns turned in at once. |\n| **Collection method** | Fixed\u2011date \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events at police stations, community centers, or mobile vans; sometimes ongoing \u201cdrop\u2011box\u201d sites. | Mobile \u201croad\u2011show\u201d units travel to neighborhoods with high gun\u2011ownership rates; \u201cmail\u2011in\u201d programs have been tried in a few places. |\n| **Disposition of the guns** | Turned over to law\u2011enforcement, then destroyed (e.g., shredding, melting) or, less often, sold to collectors after de\u2011classification. | Some programs auction de\u2011classified historic weapons to fund future buybacks. |\n| **Data collection** | Most programs record the number of guns, type, caliber, and sometimes the owner\u2019s age or zip code (often voluntarily). | A few studies have included follow\u2011up surveys of participants or linked data to crime databases. |\n\n**Key purpose statements used by organizers**\n\n1. **Removal hypothesis** \u2013 Take firearms out of circulation, especially those likely to be used in crimes or accidents.  \n2. **Community\u2011trust hypothesis** \u2013 Provide a non\u2011punitive outlet for people to dispose of unwanted weapons, improving police\u2011community relations.  \n3. **Deterrence hypothesis** \u2013 Signal that the community is serious about reducing gun violence, potentially discouraging acquisition of new weapons.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Theoretical pathways by which a buy\u2011back could affect gun violence  \n\n| Pathway | How it might work | What would have to be true for it to succeed |\n|---------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Direct removal** | Each surrendered gun is no longer available for homicide, suicide, or accidental discharge. | The surrendered guns are *the ones* that would have been used in future violent incidents. |\n| **Risk\u2011profile targeting** | If participants are disproportionately people at higher risk of misuse (e.g., gang members, recent parolees), the program removes higher\u2011risk weapons. | The program succeeds in attracting those high\u2011risk owners; voluntary participation does not self\u2011select only low\u2011risk owners. |\n| **Behavioral signaling** | Public events raise awareness, shift social norms, and discourage illegal acquisition. | The public perceives the buy\u2011back as a credible statement of community intolerance toward gun violence. |\n| **Data\u2011driven policing** | Information collected (e.g., zip codes, gun types) can guide targeted enforcement or prevention programs. | Law\u2011enforcement uses the data effectively and respects privacy/ civil\u2011rights constraints. |\n| **Economic incentive** | Cash payouts may encourage owners to sell a gun they would otherwise keep, especially if they are financially strained. | The payout outweighs the perceived utility/value of the gun for the owner. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. What the research actually finds  \n\n### 3.1 Overall trends in the literature  \n\n| Study / Review | Setting | Design | Main Findings | Limitations |\n|----------------|---------|--------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Kleck & Gertz (2004)** | U.S. city\u2011wide buy\u2011backs (Seattle, 1992\u20111993) | Pre\u2011post comparison of police reports | No statistically significant change in homicide or robbery rates; modest reduction in accidental shootings reported anecdotally. | Small number of events; no control city; possible under\u2011reporting of crimes. |\n| **Webster et al.

The \u201cbig picture\u201d advertising strategy  \n\n| Advertising channel | What was done (specific to Melbourne) | Why it mattered |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **National television & radio spots** | \u2022 30\u2011second ads aired on the three commercial networks (Seven, Nine, Ten) and on the public broadcaster ABC. <br>\u2022 Scripts emphasized *\u201cno questions asked \u2013 bring any gun, keep the cash\u201d* and showed everyday families and a police officer handing over a pistol. | TV reached >\u202f80\u202f% of households in the Greater Melbourne area; the simple, non\u2011threatening visual cue helped demystify the process. |\n| **Print media (newspapers & magazines)** | \u2022 Full\u2011page ads and editorial \u201cletters from the Premier\u201d ran in the *Herald Sun*, *The Age*, *The Australian*, and community newspapers such as the *Melbourne Times*. <br>\u2022 The ads listed the exact cash amount per weapon, the dates of the mobile\u2011van sites, and a toll\u2011free number for questions. | Print was still the primary source of local news in 1996; the inclusion of a phone line gave a low\u2011barrier way for people to ask about legal concerns. |\n| **Outdoor billboards & transit ads** | \u2022 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u2011metre billboards placed along the Eastern Freeway, Hoddle Street, and near the major train stations (Flinders Street, Southern Cross). <br>\u2022 Posters on trams, buses, and at railway stations repeated the slogan **\u201cTurn in your guns \u2013 get cash \u2013 keep your community safe.\u201d** | Outdoor media captured commuters who might not watch TV at home, reinforcing the message during daily routines. |\n| **Direct mail to licence\u2011holders** | \u2022 The Victorian Police Department mailed a two\u2011page flyer to **all 1.3\u202fmillion** registered firearm licence holders in Victoria. The flyer listed the exact dates/locations of the Melbourne mobile vans, the cash schedule, and a QR\u2011code (then a \u201cbarcode\u201d) for an online FAQ (hosted on the government website). | Targeted the *people who legally owned guns*\u2014the group most likely to bring firearms voluntarily. |\n| **Community\u2011specific outreach** | \u2022 Multilingual flyers (English, Mandarin, Arabic, Greek, Italian, Vietnamese) were distributed in suburbs with high immigrant populations (e.g., Footscray, Dandenong, St\u202fKilda). <br>\u2022 A special \u201cYouth\u2011Safety\u201d pamphlet was sent to high\u2011school principals and youth clubs. | Addressed language barriers and cultural sensitivities, signalling that the program was *for everyone*, not only \u201cAnglo\u2011Australian\u201d gun owners. |\n\n**Key point:** The advertising campaign was **co\u2011ordinated across three government agencies**\u2014the Department of Premier and Cabinet, the Victoria Police, and the Australian Federal Police\u2014so that the same message appeared everywhere the public might look.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Community\u2011group involvement: who they were and what they did  \n\n| Type of group | Example organisations (Melbourne) | Concrete activities they performed |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Local neighbourhood associations** | *Melbourne Inner\u2011City Community Association (MICCA)*, *St\u202fKilda Residents Action Group*, *Footscray Community Council* | \u2022 Held \u201cinformation caf\u00e9s\u201d in community halls the week before each mobile\u2011van stop. <br>\u2022 Provided on\u2011site volunteers to help people fill out the surrender paperwork (many participants had limited literacy). |\n| **Faith\u2011based organisations** | *St\u202fPaul\u2019s Anglican Church (Footscray)*, *Al\u2011Hidaya Islamic Centre (Dandenong)*, *Vietnamese Buddhist Temple (Cranbourne)* | \u2022 Announced the amnesty during weekly services. <br>\u2022 Offered a private room for discreet turn\u2011ins for congregants who felt uncomfortable in a police\u2011only setting. |\n| **Indigenous support groups** | *Aboriginal Health Service Victoria (AHSV)*, *Koori Youth Services* | \u2022 Ran culturally\u2011appropriate outreach in the suburbs of *Moorabbin* and *Broadmeadows",
