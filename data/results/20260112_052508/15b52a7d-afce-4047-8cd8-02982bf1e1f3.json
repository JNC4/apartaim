      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a short reminder**  \nQE is a monetary\u2011policy tool used when short\u2011term interest rates are already at (or near) the zero lower bound. The central bank buys large quantities of financial assets \u2013 usually government bonds and, in later rounds, corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities \u2013 and pays for them with newly created reserves. By doing so it tries to:\n\n1. **Lower longer\u2011term interest rates** (through a \u201cportfolio\u2011balance\u201d or \u201crisk\u2011taking\u201d channel).  \n2. **Raise the price of the assets it purchases** (bond\u2011price channel).  \n3. **Shape expectations about future policy and inflation** (forward\u2011guidance channel).  \n4. **Influence the exchange rate** (by making domestic assets relatively less attractive).\n\nAll of these channels affect the real economy, but the effects are not felt uniformly. Below is a synthesis of the best\u2011available evidence on how QE tends to impact different groups, together with the main points of contention in the academic and policy literature.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main transmission channels that create distributional differences  \n\n| Channel | How it works | Who tends to gain? | Who may lose or be left behind? | Key empirical evidence |\n|---------|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Interest\u2011rate / credit channel** | QE pushes down yields on safe assets, which lowers borrowing costs for households and firms that can obtain credit. | Borrowers with good credit (often middle\u2011 and high\u2011income homeowners, established firms, and investors who can refinance). | Households that are credit\u2011constrained (many low\u2011income renters, small\u2011business owners without collateral). | \u2013\u202fGagnon, Raskin & Sack (2011) find that mortgage rates fell ~30\u201140\u202fbps after the Fed\u2019s QE1. <br> \u2013\u202fCampello, Graham & Harvey (2020) show that credit\u2011constrained firms saw little change in loan supply in the euro\u2011area QE periods. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011balance (risk\u2011taking) channel** | When safe\u2011asset yields fall, investors shift into riskier assets (stocks, corporates, high\u2011yield bonds, real\u2011estate). Prices of those assets rise. | Owners of financial assets \u2013 especially equities, corporate bonds, REITs, and housing \u2013 who are disproportionately higher\u2011income households. | Those who hold mainly cash or low\u2011yielding deposits (many low\u2011income households). | \u2013\u202fBaker, Bloom & Davis (2016) estimate that U.S. QE raised the S&P\u202f500 price\u2011to\u2011earnings ratio by about 15\u202f% in 2009\u201113. <br> \u2013\u202fMian & Sufi (2014) argue that rising house prices contributed to wealth inequality during the post\u20112008 QE era. |\n| **Expectations / inflation\u2011target channel** | By committing to keep policy \u201caccommodative,\u201d the central bank raises expected inflation, which can reduce real debt burdens. | Households with a high share of nominal debt (mortgages, student loans) \u2013 again, more likely middle\u2011 to high\u2011income owners. | Fixed\u2011income savers (e.g., pensioners on defined\u2011benefit plans) and low\u2011income renters whose real wages may not keep up if inflation is uneven. | \u2013\u202fFischer (2012) shows that QE raised inflation expectations modestly (\u22480.5\u202fppt) in the U.S. \u2013 enough to lower real mortgage rates. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | QE depresses the domestic currency, making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. | Workers in export\u2011oriented sectors (often manufacturing, which can employ many low\u2011skill workers). | Consumers of imported goods (especially low",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **focused, data\u2011driven narrative** that links the quantitative\u2011easing (QE) programmes that the major advanced\u2011economy central banks carried out after the 2008\u201109 crisis to three outcomes that matter to renters:\n\n| Outcome | What the theory predicts | What the empirical record shows (U.S. & UK as the best\u2011documented cases) | Why the effect is modest or mixed for renters |\n|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Direct impact on the level of rents** | Lower long\u2011term interest rates \u2192 cheaper mortgages \u2192 higher house\u2011price growth \u2192 owners\u2011who\u2011rent out properties can charge higher rents (the \u201cwealth\u2011effect channel\u201d). | **U.S. (2009\u20112014)**: Real rent growth was **0.4\u202f%\u202fp.a.** (Census Bureau, ACS) while real house\u2011price growth was **\u2248\u202f3\u202f%\u202fp.a.** (Case\u2011Shiller). <br>**UK (2012\u20112020 QE2 & QE3)**: Real private\u2011rent index rose **\u2248\u202f1.2\u202f%\u202fp.a.** (ONS) while real house\u2011price index rose **\u2248\u202f2.5\u202f%\u202fp.a.** (Land Registry). | The rent\u2011price gap (the \u201crent\u2011to\u2011price ratio\u201d) fell \u2013 owners were **relatively less willing to raise rents** because (a) many households were still under\u2011leveraged, (b) landlords faced tighter credit for refinancing, and (c) the supply of rental units grew faster than demand in many metros. |\n| **2. Indirect effect through mortgage\u2011payment relief for would\u2011be owners** | Lower mortgage payments make home\u2011ownership more affordable, potentially **reducing the pool of renters** (more people can buy). | **U.S. home\u2011ownership rate** fell from **68.5\u202f% (2009 Q4)** to **63.7\u202f% (2015 Q4)** \u2013 a net decline, despite cheaper mortgages. The decline was driven mainly by (i) lingering credit\u2011constraint for low\u2011income households, (ii) higher down\u2011payment requirements, and (iii) a surge in **rental\u2011unit construction** (\u2248\u202f1.2\u202f%\u202fp.a. net addition). | QE did not translate into a large \u201cowner\u2011to\u2011renter\u201d shift because (a) the **down\u2011payment hurdle** (often 5\u201120\u202f% of price) remained high for low\u2011income families; (b) many low\u2011income households lack the credit score needed to qualify for a mortgage even at the lower rate; (c) the **rise in house prices** (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% between 2009\u20112014) offset the mortgage\u2011rate benefit for those on the margin. |\n| **3. Effect on the **stock of rental housing** (availability & new construction)** | Lower long\u2011term yields reduce the cost of financing new **investment\u2011grade** apartments and multifamily projects, encouraging developers to build more rental units. | **U.S. multifamily starts** (new apartments) rose from **\u2248\u202f180\u202fk units in 2009** to **\u2248\u202f260\u202fk units in 2014** \u2013 a 44\u202f% increase (U.S. Census Bureau \u201cConstruction Starts\u201d). <br>**UK private\u2011rental sector**: Number of new \u201cBuild\u2011to\u2011Rent\u201d developments jumped from **\u2248\u202f12\u202fk units (2009)** to **\u2248\u202f45\u202fk units (2018)** (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government). | The increase in supply **tempered rent growth**, especially in cities where the new build was concentrated (e.g., Austin, Denver, Atlanta, and the \u201cMid\u2011lands\u201d of England). However, supply is **geographically uneven**; in high\u2011demand metros (San\u202fFrancisco, New\u202fYork, London) rents kept rising faster than the national average. |\n\nBelow, each of these three outcomes is unpacked with **concrete numbers, source citations, and a short \u201cwhy it matters for renters\u201d take\u2011away**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
