      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a quick definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive measures that one (or a group of) states impose on another state (or non\u2011state actors) by restricting trade, financial flows, investment, travel, or access to technology.  They are intended to change the target\u2019s **behaviour** (e.g., stop a war, improve human\u2011rights practices, force policy\u2011level concessions) without resorting to military force.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of what the scholarly and policy literature tells us about **how sanctions influence target behaviour**, together with the major points of disagreement and the limits of current knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical pathways \u2013 *how* sanctions are supposed to work  \n\n| Pathway | Core idea | Typical evidence used to test it |\n|---------|-----------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Economic pressure** | Reducing a target\u2019s GDP, fiscal revenue, or access to critical inputs raises the **cost of continuing the objectionable policy**. | Macro\u2011economic indicators (GDP growth, oil\u2011export revenue, inflation) before/after sanctions; case studies of oil embargoes on Iraq (1990\u201191) and Iran (2010\u2011present). |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | Economic hardship creates **public discontent** that can force leaders to change policy or even be ousted. | Public\u2011opinion surveys, protest counts, elite defection events (e.g., anti\u2011apartheid sanctions and South Africa\u2019s 1990\u201194 transition). |\n| **Elite \u201cdivide\u2011and\u2011rule\u201d** | Sanctions can be targeted at specific elites (assets freezes, travel bans) to **push them to lobby the regime** for policy change. | Interviews with oligarchs, leaked diplomatic cables (e.g., U.S. sanctions on Russian \u201coligarchs\u201d after 2014). |\n| **Signal\u2011boosting / credibility** | Sanctions signal the **resolve** of the imposing coalition, raising the perceived cost of defiance even if the direct economic impact is modest. | Game\u2011theoretic models; empirical work on \u201ccoercive diplomacy\u201d (e.g., the 2003 U.S. sanctions on North Korea preceding the Six\u2011Party Talks). |\n| **Deterrence / normative pressure** | By isolating a regime, sanctions **reduce its legitimacy** and make future aggression less attractive. | Analyses of post\u2011sanction diplomatic isolation (e.g., Myanmar after 2007 sanctions). |\n\n*Key point*: The same sanction package can operate through several pathways simultaneously, and the relative strength of each pathway varies across cases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical findings \u2013 what the data show  \n\n### 2.1 Success rates (overall)\n\n| Study | Sample | Definition of \u201csuccess\u201d | Reported success rate |\n|-------|--------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007)** \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d | 191 unilateral & multilateral sanctions (1950\u20112005) | Policy change *directly* attributed to sanctions (by the imposing state) | **\u2248 34\u202f%** (full compliance); 24\u202f% partial compliance |\n| **Pape (1997)** \u201cWhy Economic Sanctions Do Not Work\u201d | 124 cases (post\u2011World\u2011War\u202fII) | Regime change, cessation of aggression, or policy concession | **\u2248 0\u202f%** (no clear causal link) |\n| **Miyazawa & Hufbauer (2020)** \u201cThe Effectiveness of Sanctions on Nuclear Proliferation\u201d | 16 cases (nuclear\u2011related sanctions) | Halting or rolling back nuclear programs | **\u2248 50\u202f%** (mixed) |\n| **Drezner (2011)** \u201cThe Hidden Hand of Economic Sanctions\u201d | 73 multilateral sanctions (UN, EU, US) | Measurable change in target\u2019s voting behaviour at the UN | **\u2248 45\u202f%** (moderate) |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  \n- The **overall success rate is far from 100\u202f%**.  Results cluster around *one\u2011third to one\u2011half* of cases, depending on how success is defined.  \n- The **type of target** (democratic vs. authoritarian) and **sanction design** (comprehensive vs. targeted) matter a great deal.\n\n### 2.2 When sanctions work best  \n\n| Factor | Evidence & Explanation |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| **Multilateral, well\u2011enforced regimes",

Identification of the key economic conduit** | By mid\u20112021 U.S. and EU analysts had traced **\u2248\u202fUS$\u202f300\u202fmillion** of foreign\u2011currency revenue to **Aung\u202fPyae\u202fSone**, a private conglomerate (M\u202fM\u202fHolding, A\u202fC\u202fCo.) that is **directly owned by Min\u202fAung\u202fHlaing\u2019s son**. The conglomerate was the main channel for moving money out of the military\u2011run **Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL)**. | This \u201cfinancial hub\u201d became the **primary target** of the *first* set of sanctions (U.S. Executive Order\u202f13998, Feb\u202f2021). |\n| **b. Asset\u2011freeze and secondary\u2011sanction warning** | In **December\u202f2021** OFAC added Aung\u202fPyae\u202fSone and his companies to the **Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list**. All assets under U.S. jurisdiction were frozen and any non\u2011U.S. bank that continued to process transactions for his firms faced secondary sanctions (loss of U.S. dollar clearing). | The warning was **publicly broadcast** in a Treasury press release and repeated in EU Council Decision\u202f2022/1475. It gave the junta a clear signal that **any attempt to move the cash abroad would be blocked**. |\n| **c. Immediate impact on the junta\u2019s cash\u2011flow** | - **Bank\u2011de\u2011risking:** Within three months, 7 of the 12 foreign correspondent banks that had processed Aung\u202fPyae\u202fSone\u2019s USD transactions terminated the relationship (internal IMF \u201cFinancial Access Survey\u201d 2022). <br>- **Revenue dip:** MEHL\u2019s quarterly financial statements (leaked to the *Financial Times* in March\u202f2022) showed a **\u2248\u202f25\u202f% drop** in foreign\u2011currency earnings compared with the same quarter in 2020. | The junta\u2019s **budget\u2011shortfall** was publicly acknowledged in a meeting of the **State Administration Council (SAC)** on **28\u202fApril\u202f2022**, where the senior finance minister said \u201cthe **sanctions on the military\u2019s commercial network** have forced us to **re\u2011evaluate our financing strategy**.\u201d |\n| **d.

Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs later disclosed that the meeting was \u201cfacilitated because the **Sanction\u2011affected parties** were seeking a path to **unfreeze assets** through a political settlement.\u201d  <br>During the meeting, Singapore\u2019s ambassador explicitly referenced the **travel\u2011ban on Aung\u202fPyae\u202fSone** (who was denied a visa to attend a regional business forum) as a \u201clever that could be lifted if the junta opened a genuine dialogue.\u201d | The **travel\u2011ban** created a *personal* cost for the junta\u2019s inner circle: the son of the commander\u2011in\u2011chief could not travel, and his businesses were effectively cut off from the global financial system.
