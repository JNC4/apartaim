      "unknown_model_response": "**Current scientific consensus on health risks from 5G cell\u2011tower emissions**\n\n| Source | What was studied | Main findings | Relevance to 5G |\n|--------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** \u2013 International EMF Project | Epidemiological studies of radio\u2011frequency (RF) exposure (including frequencies now used for 5G) and health outcomes such as cancer, reproductive effects, and neurological disorders. | No consistent evidence that exposure below international limits (ICNIRP/IEEE) causes adverse health effects. RF fields are classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic\u201d (Group\u202f2B) based largely on older, higher\u2011exposure studies, not on modern low\u2011power cellular deployments. | 5G uses similar power levels to earlier generations; compliance with the same exposure limits is required. |\n| **International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)** \u2013 Guidelines (2020 update) | Review of experimental and epidemiological data on RF fields up to 300\u202fGHz (covering 5G millimeter\u2011wave bands). | Established exposure limits that are far below levels shown to cause tissue heating or other biological effects. No credible data indicating non\u2011thermal effects at levels permitted for public exposure. | 5G base stations and user devices must stay within these limits. |\n| **U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** \u2013 RF Safety Requirements | Measured field strengths from deployed 5G infrastructure and compared them to the FCC\u2019s Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and power\u2011density limits. | All tested sites were well under the permissible limits; no acute health incidents were reported. | Ongoing monitoring continues; the FCC requires compliance testing before any new equipment is authorized. |\n| **European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) \u2013 2021 Report** | Systematic review of peer\u2011reviewed literature on millimeter\u2011wave (mmWave) exposure (24\u201386\u202fGHz) used by 5G. | Concluded that current evidence does not support a causal link between mmWave exposure at levels below the limits and adverse health effects. | Highlights the need for continued research but affirms safety under existing regulations. |\n| **Peer\u2011reviewed meta\u2011analyses (e.g., R\u00f6\u00f6sli et\u202fal., 2022; Ahlbom et\u202fal., 2023)** | Combined data from many epidemiological studies on mobile\u2011phone and base\u2011station RF exposure. | No statistically significant increase in brain tumors, glioma, acoustic neuroma, or other health outcomes attributable to typical environmental exposure levels. | Mobile\u2011phone use involves higher exposure to the head than proximity to a cell tower, yet no consistent risks have been found. |\n\n### Key Points to Understand\n\n1. **Exposure Levels Are Low**  \n   - 5G base stations transmit at power levels of a few watts to tens of watts, far less than a typical household microwave oven (\u22481\u202fkW).  \n   - The radio\u2011frequency energy diminishes rapidly with distance (inverse\u2011square law), so the public\u2019s exposure from a tower is a tiny fraction of the limits.\n\n2. **Regulatory Limits Are Conservative**  \n   - International and national guidelines are set with large safety margins (often 50\u2013100 times lower than levels that cause measurable heating in tissue).  \n   - Compliance is mandatory before any equipment can be installed.\n\n3. **Thermal vs. Non\u2011Thermal Effects**  \n   - The only well\u2011established biological effect of RF energy is heating (thermal effect).  \n   - Extensive laboratory research has not demonstrated reproducible non\u2011thermal biological changes at exposure levels permitted for the public.\n\n4. **Epidemiological Evidence**  \n   - Large",
