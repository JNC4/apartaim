Overall Volume of Guns Collected\n| Study / Country | Period & Scale | Guns Collected | Share of Estimated Private\u2011Gun Stock |\n|-----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Australia (1996 national buyback)** \u2013 650,000 guns, $0.5\u202fbn cost | 1996\u20111997, nationwide | ~650,000 firearms (\u224820\u202f% of estimated private stock) | 20\u202f% |\n| **Canada (Ontario 2005\u20112008)** \u2013 6,000 guns | 3\u2011year pilot | 6,000 | <1\u202f% of provincial stock |\n| **U.S. city\u2011level pilots** (e.g., Seattle 2019, Boston 2022) | 1\u20112\u202fdays each, $50\u2011$200 per gun | 500\u20131,200 guns per event | <0.1\u202f% of local stock (estimates vary) |\n| **New\u202fZealand (2021 post\u2011Christchurch)** \u2013 56,000 guns | 6\u2011month voluntary program + 1\u2011month mandatory surrender | 56,000 (\u224819\u202f% of private stock) | 19\u202f% |\n\n*Take\u2011away*: Buybacks can remove a measurable number of firearms, but the proportion of the total private\u2011gun pool that is surrendered is usually modest, especially in the United States where the civilian stock is very large (\u2248393\u202fmillion guns in 2023, ~1.2 guns per person).\n\n---\n\n### ",

What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is**\n\n| Step | Typical practice (U.S. and comparable programs) |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Announcement & funding** | A city, state, or national government (or a nonprofit) sets a budget and publicizes a date and location. Funding usually comes from municipal budgets, earmarked taxes, or private donations. |\n| **Eligibility rules** | Most programs are **voluntary** and accept any firearm that the owner is legally allowed to possess (sometimes only certain types\u2014handguns, assault\u2011style rifles, etc.). Some require proof of legal ownership; others accept \u201cunregistered\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d guns but may not provide a receipt. |\n| **Incentive** | Participants receive cash, gift cards, vouchers, or a \u201clottery ticket\u201d for each gun turned in. The amount varies widely (often $50\u2011$200 per firearm). |\n| **Collection & verification** | Collected guns are taken to a secure site, logged, and inspected by law\u2011enforcement or a licensed firearms dealer. Serial numbers are recorded (if present) and the weapons are either destroyed (shredded, melted) or, in rare cases, transferred to a museum or used for training. |\n| **Public\u2011relations component** | Media coverage, community\u2011outreach events, and sometimes partnership with schools or faith\u2011based groups are used to encourage participation and signal that the government is \u201ctackling gun violence.\u201d |\n| **Follow\u2011up** | Some jurisdictions publish the number of guns collected, their types, and the cost per gun.

Australia \u2013 1996 National Firearms Buy\u2011Back\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Policy trigger** | After the Port Arthur mass\u2011shooting (28\u202fdeaths) on 28\u202fApril\u202f1996, the Australian federal government passed the *National Firearms Agreement* (NFA). The NFA banned semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and pump\u2011action shotguns, introduced a uniform licensing system, and funded a **nation\u2011wide, compulsory\u2011purchase buy\u2011back**. |\n| **Scale** | About **650\u202f000 firearms** (\u224820\u202f% of the estimated private\u2011gun stock at the time) were turned in over a 12\u2011month period. The program cost **\u2248AU$0.5\u202fbillion** (\u2248US$350\u202fmillion in 1996 dollars). |\n| **Outcome measures examined** | \u2022 Firearm homicide rate (per 100\u202f000 population)  <br>\u2022 Firearm suicide rate (per 100\u202f000) <br>\u2022 Overall homicide and suicide rates (to see if any displacement to other weapons occurred) |\n| **Findings from the most\u2010cited peer\u2011reviewed analyses** | 1. **Homicide** \u2013 A 2005 study in *Epidemiology* (Chapman, Alpers, & Squires) found that **firearm homicide fell from 0.88 to 0.33 per 100\u202f000** (\u224862\u202f% reduction) in the 10\u202fyears after the NFA, while **non\u2011firearm homicide showed no compensatory rise**.  <br>2. **Suicide** \u2013 The same authors reported a drop in **firearm suicide from 1.68 to 0.57 per 100\u202f000** (\u224866\u202f% reduction) over the same period; overall suicide rates fell modestly (\u224813\u202f% total).  <br>3. **Temporal pattern** \u2013 Most of the decline occurred within the first 3\u20114\u202fyears after the buy\u2011back, before any major changes in other policy areas (e.g., mandatory minimum sentences). |\n| **Interpretation by scholars** | \u2022 **Pro\u2011buy\u2011back argument** \u2013 The removal of a large share of readily available semi\u2011automatic weapons, combined with stricter licensing, is credited for the sharp fall in firearm homicide and suicide.  <br>\u2022 **Cautionary notes** \u2013 Critics point out that the NFA also introduced **new licensing, background checks, and safe\u2011storage requirements**, making it impossible to isolate the buy\u2011back itself.  <br>\u2022 **Consensus** \u2013 Most criminologists and public\u2011health researchers agree that **the bundle of reforms\u2014including the buy\u2011back\u2014produced a real and sustained reduction in gun deaths** (see \u201cAustralian Institute of Criminology\u201d 2020 review). |\n\n### Why this example is often highlighted\n\n* **Large, well\u2011documented sample** \u2013 650\u202fk guns is a sizable fraction of the nation's stock, allowing a clear before\u2011after comparison.\n* **National data series** \u2013 Australia maintains uniform, publicly available homicide & suicide statistics, which makes trend analysis straightforward.\n* **Policy cohesion** \u2013 The buy\u2011back was implemented *simultaneously* with other sweeping gun\u2011control measures, so the whole \u201cpost\u2011NFA\u201d environment is a natural experiment for \u201ccomprehensive reform.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2.
