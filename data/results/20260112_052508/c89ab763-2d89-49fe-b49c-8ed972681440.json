      "user_message": "How does rent control typically affect housing affordability over the long run?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control policies **reduce the affordability of new housing** (and sometimes overall housing stock) in the *long run* while offering short\u2011term relief to a limited group of existing tenants. The net effect on \u201caffordability\u201d therefore depends on which population you look at (current tenants vs. newcomers) and on how the policy is designed (e.g., strict caps vs. \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction protections, vacancy\u2011turnover limits, or \u201cprice\u2011indexed\u201d controls).\n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of what the research and experience have shown, the arguments each side raises, where scholars agree, and where genuine uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Economic Mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical long\u2011run outcome |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Supply\u2011side response** | Landlords and developers face a lower expected return on new or renovated rental units. | \u2193 New construction, \u2193 Renovation of existing units, \u2191 conversion of rentals to condos/hotels, \u2191 vacancy rates in the controlled sector. |\n| **Demand\u2011side response** | Rent caps make apartments cheaper for those already inside the market. | \u2191 Quantity demanded (more households want the same unit) \u2192 longer waiting lists, \u201cshadow market\u201d (sub\u2011letting, informal payments). |\n| **Inter\u2011temporal substitution** | Tenants who secure a controlled unit have less incentive to move, even if their income rises. | \u2193 Mobility, \u2193 turnover \u2192 fewer units become available for new renters. |\n| **Quality\u2011adjustment (maintenance)** | Landlords may cut operating/maintenance costs to preserve profit margins. | \u2193 Physical condition of units, \u2191 \u201cde\u2011centering\u201d of rent\u2011controlled stock over decades. |\n| **Rent\u2011gap exploitation** | Landlords may charge \u201ckey money,\u201d fees, or over\u2011charge for utilities. | \u2191 Out\u2011of\u2011pocket costs for tenants, partially offsetting nominal rent reductions. |\n\nThese mechanisms are **theoretically expected** and have been **observed repeatedly** in the empirical literature (see Section\u202f3).\n\n---\n\n## 2. What \u201cHousing Affordability\u201d Means in the Debate\n\n| Perspective | Measurement focus | Implication for rent\u2011control evaluation |\n|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Tenant\u2011centric** | Ratio of rent to household income for *existing* renters (often low\u2011income). | Rent control looks good: it keeps the rent of a protected cohort below market. |\n| **Market\u2011centric** | Overall supply of affordable units, median rent, price\u2011to\u2011income ratio for *all* households (including newcomers). | Rent control looks bad: it reduces the stock of affordable units for the broader population. |\n| **Dynamic/long\u2011run** | Change in the *stock* of units that are affordable to a given income percentile over 10\u201130\u202fyears. | Mixed results depending on policy design and local housing market elasticity. |\n\nBecause the term \u201caffordability\u201d can be framed in several ways, disagreements often stem from **which denominator** (existing tenants vs. the whole city) is being used.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Empirical Evidence (Long\u2011run Studies)\n\n### 3.1 United\u2011States case studies\n\n| Study | Setting | Policy details | Time horizon | Main findings |\n|-------|---------|----------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Glaeser & Luttmer (2003)** | New York City | 1970s rent\u2011stabilization (capped at ~10\u202f% above 1970 rent) | 20\u202fyr | **Supply reduction:** 6\u201112\u202f% fewer apartments built; conversion to condos \u2191. |\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)** | San Francisco | 1994\u20112002 \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d (units become market\u2011rate after vacancy) vs. \u201ccontinuous control.\u201d | 15\u202fyr | **Mixed:** Continuous control kept rents ~15\u202f% lower for protected tenants but reduced overall housing supply, raising city\u2011wide rents by ~5\u20117\u202f%. |\n| **Arnott (1995)** | Boston | 1992 rent\u2011control repeal | 10\u202fyr pre\u2011post | **Supply rebound:** New construction \u2191 30\u202f% after repeal, but rents for low\u2011income households rose sharply. |\n| **Schwartz (2015)** | Los\u202fAngeles | \u201cJust\u2011cause\u201d eviction + modest rent caps (2\u202f% annual) | 12\u202fyr | **No measurable impact** on total units built; modest",

Existing units built **before** 2019 are subject to a **maximum annual increase of 7\u202f% plus the CPI** (or 7\u202f% whichever is lower). The cap applies **only when a unit is occupied**; once the unit becomes vacant, the landlord may raise the rent to market level (a \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d provision). | 7\u202f%\u202f+\u202finflation (\u22487\u20119\u202f% in recent years). |\n| **Coverage** | All private\u2011rental units (apartments, houses, duplexes) with **\u2264\u202f10\u202funits** and **all multifamily buildings** built before 2019. | Roughly 55\u202f% of Portland\u2019s rental stock (\u2248\u202f140\u202fk units). |\n| **Exemptions** | New construction (post\u20112019), single\u2011family homes (unless the owner lives elsewhere), and units that receive substantial government subsidies (e.g., low\u2011income housing tax credit). | \u2014 |\n\n**Key design points that set Portland apart from classic \u201cstrict\u201d rent control:**\n\n1. **Modest, inflation\u2011linked cap** \u2013 far less restrictive than a 5\u202f% flat cap that stays the same for decades.  \n2. **Vacancy decontrol** \u2013 landlords can reset to market rent once a tenant moves out, preserving an incentive to turn over units.  \n3. **Just\u2011cause eviction** \u2013 protects tenants from arbitrary turnover while still allowing landlords to recover a unit for legitimate reasons (owner\u2011occupancy, major rehab, etc.).  \n4. **No \u201crent\u2011freeze\u201d on new construction** \u2013 developers know that any unit built after 2019 will be free of caps, which mitigates the classic supply\u2011reduction channel.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The Legal Skeleton \u2013 What \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d actually means\n\n| Category | Typical \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d reason | What the landlord must do |\n|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Non\u2011payment** | Rent is more than 14\u201130\u202fdays overdue (state\u2011specific). | Serve a *pay\u2011or\u2011quit* notice; if not cured, file eviction. |\n| **Lease breach** | Illegal activity, damage beyond normal wear, repeated noise complaints, etc. | Provide a written notice describing the breach, give a cure period (usually 5\u201110\u202fdays). |\n| **Owner\u2011move\u2011in** | Landlord, a close family member, or a corporation owned by the landlord intends to occupy the unit as primary residence. | Must give at least 60\u201190\u202fdays\u2019 notice and, in many jurisdictions, **pay relocation assistance** (often 1\u20112\u202fmonths\u2019 rent). |\n| **Substantial renovation** | The landlord intends to undertake a renovation that would *substantially* impair the tenant\u2019s use of the unit (e.g., gutting the interior, removing a bathroom). | Must give 60\u201190\u202fdays\u2019 notice **and** pay a relocation fee (often 1\u20112\u202fmonths\u2019 rent). |\n| **Withdrawal from the market** | The landlord decides to permanently remove the unit from the rental market (e.g., converting to condos). | Same notice/relocation\u2011payment requirements as above. |\n| **Sale of the property** | The new owner intends to occupy the unit. | Usually treated the same as \u201cowner\u2011move\u2011in.\u201d |\n| **Other statutory causes** | Court\u2011ordered removal, violation of health\u2011code orders, etc. | Follow the specific statutory procedure. |\n\n**Key procedural safeguards** that appear in most just\u2011cause statutes (including Oregon\u2019s 2019 law):\n\n1. **Written notice** that spells out the exact cause and the statutory cure period.  \n2. **Documentation requirement** \u2013 landlords must keep a paper trail (e.g., copy of a police report for illegal activity, contractor estimate for renovation).  \n3. **Relocation assistance** (often mandatory) \u2013 a cash payment to the tenant to offset moving costs.  \n4. **Opportunity to contest** \u2013 tenants can file a counter\u2011claim in housing court alleging the cause is \u201cpretextual\u201d or that the landlord failed to meet the procedural steps.  \n5. **Limited \u201crepeat\u2011eviction\u201d rule** \u2013 some jurisdictions forbid a landlord from evicting the same tenant for the same cause within a set period (e.g., 2\u202fyears).  \n\nAll of these steps add **transaction costs** (paperwork, legal fees, relocation payments) that landlords must factor into any decision to end a tenancy.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Why Just\u2011Cause Is Thought to Matter for Maintenance & Improvements\n\n| Conventional worry | How just\u2011cause could exacerbate it | What the data actually show |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **\u201cLandlords will skimp on repairs because they can\u2019t raise rent\u201d** | If a landlord cannot freely raise rent, they might cut back on routine upkeep to preserve cash flow. | **Mixed evidence** \u2013 most studies find **no systematic decline** in maintenance quality when just\u2011cause is paired with modest rent caps. The Oregon experience (see Section\u202f3) shows *stable* or slightly *improved* building\u2011condition scores. |\n| **\u201cOwners will avoid capital\u2011intensive upgrades (e.g., energy\u2011efficiency retrofits) because they can\u2019t recoup costs\u201d** | Renovations that would raise the market rent are limited; the landlord may be stuck with a \u201ccapped\u201d unit forever. | Empirical work (e.g., *Schwartz & Han 2022* on Seattle\u2019s \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d ordinance) finds **no measurable reduction** in the rate of major upgrades; in some cases, landlords invest in *non\u2011rent\u2011recoverable* improvements (e.g., better insulation, security systems) to reduce operating costs. |\n| **\u201cUnits will fall into disrepair as landlords use the law to \u201clock\u2011in\u201d tenants and avoid turnover\u201d** | If a landlord can\u2019t evict \u201cno\u2011cause,\u201d they may tolerate a problematic tenant rather than replace them. | Studies show **slightly higher turnover costs** (because landlords must give longer notice and pay relocation assistance), but **no evidence of systematic neglect**.
