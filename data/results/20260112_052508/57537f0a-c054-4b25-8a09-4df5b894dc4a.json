Most guidelines quote the *cooked* weight because that\u2019s what you actually eat.\n\n---\n\n### 2.\u202fSimple, satisfying ways to cut back on **processed** meat\n\nProcessed meats (bacon, sausage, ham, salami, deli slices, canned meat) are the group with the strongest cancer link (\u2248\u202f18\u202f% higher colorectal\u2011cancer risk per 50\u202fg/day).
