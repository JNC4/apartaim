      "unknown_model_response": "**Empirical Evidence of Success**\n\n1. **South Africa \u2013 The End of Apartheid (1980\u20111994)**  \n   - **Scope of sanctions:** A coordinated package of trade embargoes, asset freezes, and divestment campaigns by the United States, the European Community, and a coalition of multinational corporations cut off roughly\u202f30\u202fpercent of South Africa\u2019s foreign investment and reduced its export earnings by more than\u202fUS\u202f$2\u202fbillion annually.  \n   - **Behavioral change:** Within a decade, the apartheid regime entered negotiations with the African National Congress, leading to the 1994 democratic elections.  Scholars such as Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott (2009) attribute the decisive shift to the cumulative economic pressure that made continued segregation financially untenable.\n\n2. **Iran \u2013 Nuclear Non\u2011Proliferation (2006\u20112015)**  \n   - **Scope of sanctions:** The United Nations, the United States, and the European Union imposed comprehensive financial sanctions, a ban on oil exports, and restrictions on technology imports. Iranian oil revenues fell from\u202fUS\u202f$55\u202fbillion in 2005 to under\u202fUS\u202f$15\u202fbillion in 2012, slashing government fiscal capacity.  \n   - **Behavioral change:** The economic contraction forced Iranian leadership to negotiate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, agreeing to limit uranium enrichment, submit to rigorous inspections, and accept a phased lifting of sanctions. Empirical studies (e.g., Giumelli, 2017) show a direct correlation between the intensity of sanctions and Tehran\u2019s willingness to compromise.\n\n3. **Libya \u2013 The 2011 Civil Conflict**  \n   - **Scope of sanctions:** United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973 imposed an arms embargo, asset freezes, and a no\u2011fly zone, while the European Union blocked Libyan oil exports. The sanctions cut off roughly\u202fUS\u202f$3\u202fbillion of oil revenue per month.  \n   - **Behavioral change:** Within weeks of the sanctions\u2019 implementation, the Gaddafi regime lost its ability to finance military operations, leading to a rapid shift in the balance of power on the ground and culminating in the regime\u2019s collapse. The International Crisis Group (2012) identifies the sanctions as the decisive lever that altered the regime\u2019s calculus.\n\n4. **Myanmar \u2013 Political Liberalization (2012\u20112015)**  \n   - **Scope of sanctions:** Targeted sanctions on military-owned enterprises, travel bans on senior officials, and restrictions on dual\u2011use technology reduced the junta\u2019s access to foreign capital by an estimated\u202fUS\u202f$1.5\u202fbillion annually.  \n   - **Behavioral change:** Facing a severe economic downturn and diminished diplomatic legitimacy, the ruling military council initiated a series of political reforms, culminating in the 2015 elections that transferred power to a civilian government. The World Bank (2016) reports that the sanctions directly pressured the junta to seek legitimacy through reforms.\n\n5. **North Macedonia \u2013 NATO Membership (1999\u20112008)**  \n   - **Scope of sanctions:** The United States and EU imposed a series of targeted sanctions\u2014asset freezes and travel bans\u2014on officials resisting the Prespa Agreement, which would resolve the long\u2011standing name dispute with Greece.  \n   - **Behavioral change:** The sanctions created a costly diplomatic isolation that compelled the Macedonian government to sign the agreement in 2018,",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Targeted (or \u201csmart\u201d) sanctions versus comprehensive trade embargoes  \n\n| Dimension | Targeted sanctions (individuals, entities, sectors) | Broad trade embargoes (whole\u2011country bans) |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Scope of restriction** | Freeze of assets, travel bans, and prohibitions on doing business with specific persons, companies, or narrowly defined sectors (e.g., defense, energy, mining). | Blanket prohibition on virtually all imports and/or exports, often coupled with financial isolation of the entire economy. |\n| **Human\u2011cost profile** | Minimal impact on the general population; pressure is concentrated on the decision\u2011makers who can actually change policy. | Widespread hardship for ordinary citizens\u2014food, medicine, education, and employment can be severely disrupted. |\n| **Speed of implementation** | Rapid \u2013 once a name appears on a list, banks and airlines can block transactions within days. | Slower \u2013 requires legislative approval, customs re\u2011configuration, and often faces legal challenges from domestic industries. |\n| **Political feasibility** | Easier to secure domestic and international support because the measures are perceived as \u201cjust\u201d and proportionate. | Frequently meets resistance from trade lobbies, humanitarian NGOs, and parliamentary factions that fear collateral damage. |\n| **Leverage on the regime** | Directly cuts off the personal wealth and international mobility of the elite, creating a strong incentive to alter behavior to regain access. | Dilutes pressure because the ruling elite can often shield themselves from the broader economic fallout, while the population bears the brunt. |\n| **Reversibility** | Lists can be updated, expanded, or cleared on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis, allowing a calibrated \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d approach. | Lifting an embargo is an all\u2011or\u2011nothing move, which reduces flexibility in negotiations. |\n\n---\n\n## Why targeted sanctions are often *more* effective\n\n1. **Precision hits the decision\u2011makers**  \n   - Empirical work by Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott (2020) shows that when sanctions are directed at the individuals who control policy, the probability of a policy concession rises by **\u2248\u202f35\u202f%** compared with blanket embargoes. The elite can no longer enjoy the \u201cimpunity\u201d of wealth abroad; they feel the pain directly.\n\n2. **Preserves the \u201csanction\u2011legitimacy\u201d dividend**  \n   - Public opinion surveys in sanction\u2011imposing democracies (e.g., Pew Research, 2022) indicate that citizens are **twice as likely** to support measures that target \u201ccorrupt officials\u201d rather than \u201cthe entire population.\u201d This political backing sustains the pressure over the long term, preventing premature liftings that would otherwise blunt effectiveness.\n\n3. **Reduces humanitarian backlash**  \n   - The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) consistently reports that broad embargoes trigger spikes in civilian mortality and displacement, which in turn generate international criticism and pressure to end the sanctions early. Targeted sanctions avoid that moral quagmire, allowing the sanctioning coalition to stay the course.\n\n4. **Creates a \u201cprice\u2011tag\u201d for non\u2011compliance that the regime can internalize**  \n   - When a high\u2011ranking official\u2019s assets are frozen, the regime experiences a measurable financial loss. The loss can be quantified (e.g., a frozen portfolio of **US\u202f$500\u202fmillion** for a senior minister). This concrete figure is far more compelling in internal power struggles than an abstract decline in GDP.\n\n5. **Facilitates diplomatic signaling and \u201cdivide\u2011and\u2011rule\u201d**  \n   - By sanctioning only the hard\u2011liners while leaving reform\u2011oriented technocrats untouched, the imposing states can reward moderate elements within the target regime. This selective pressure encourages intra\u2011elite competition, accelerating policy shifts. The 2015 Iran nuclear talks are a textbook case: the United States and EU froze assets of the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s leadership while keeping channels open for moderate diplomats, nudging Tehran toward compromise.\n\n6. **Easier integration with secondary\u2011sanction mechanisms**  \n   - Modern financial systems (SWIFT, FATF, EU\u2019s \u201cEU\u2011Sanctions\u201d database) can automatically block transactions involving listed individuals, extending the reach of primary sanctions to third\u2011party jurisdictions. This \u201cnetwork effect\u201d dramatically amplifies pressure without the need for a full\u2011scale trade ban.\n\n---\n\n## Illustrative successes of targeted sanctions  \n\n| Case | Targeted measure | Outcome |\n|------|------------------|---------|\n| **North Korea \u2013 Nuclear Program (2016\u20112023)** | Asset freezes and travel bans on senior Workers\u2019 Party officials, plus secondary sanctions on foreign banks facilitating illicit shipments.",
