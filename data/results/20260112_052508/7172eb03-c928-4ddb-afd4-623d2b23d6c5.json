      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a quick definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive measures that restrict a target country\u2019s trade, financial transactions, investment, or access to specific goods and services. They can be *unilateral* (imposed by one state) or *multilateral* (imposed by a coalition such as the UN, EU, or a group of like\u2011minded states). The ultimate goal is to change the target\u2019s *behaviour*\u2014usually to stop a policy, compel a concession, or punish a perceived violation of international norms\u2014without resorting to military force.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of **how sanctions are thought to work**, the **empirical evidence on their success or failure**, and the **key factors that shape their impact**. Wherever possible I note where the evidence is strong, where it is mixed, and where scholars still debate the mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical pathways: How sanctions can affect a target\n\n| Pathway | Description | Typical evidence used to assess it |\n|---------|-------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Economic cost (price) channel** | Sanctions raise the cost of imports, reduce export revenues, limit access to foreign capital, or create shortages of critical inputs (e.g., technology, oil). Higher costs reduce national welfare and can create pressure on elites to change policy. | GDP growth differentials; trade\u2011flow statistics; inflation spikes; balance\u2011of\u2011payments data. |\n| **Political elite\u2010targeting (elite bargaining) channel** | Sanctions are aimed at the ruling coalition, its businesses, or its foreign\u2011exchange earnings. By hurting the *beneficiaries* of the status quo, sanctions create incentives for those elites to negotiate or alter policy. | Changes in elite wealth, asset freezes, lobbying activity, elite defection rates. |\n| **Domestic public pressure (mass mobilisation) channel** | Economic hardship can spark protests, strikes, or electoral backlash against the regime, forcing leaders to respond. | Protest event counts, opinion\u2011poll data, election outcomes. |\n| **International isolation (normative) channel** | Sanctions signal a diplomatic repudiation that can erode a regime\u2019s legitimacy, limit its ability to forge alliances, and make it more dependent on a smaller set of partners. | Diplomatic recognition indices, voting patterns in international bodies, foreign\u2011policy alignment. |\n| **Regime\u2011type mediation channel** | In democratic or semi\u2011democratic systems, leaders are more responsive to public opinion and thus more likely to adjust policy when sanctions affect the electorate. In authoritarian regimes, the same economic pain may simply reinforce repression. | Regime\u2011type classifications (Polity, V\u2011Dem), correlation with policy change. |\n| **Technological & knowledge\u2011transfer channel** | Sanctions that block high\u2011technology goods or research collaboration can stall a country\u2019s strategic projects (e.g., nuclear, missile, cyber). | Patent filings, R&D spending, satellite\u2011launch frequency, nuclear\u2011enrichment metrics. |\n\n*Key point:* **Sanctions rarely work through a single pathway**; most successful cases involve a combination of economic pressure, elite incentives, and political signaling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature says\n\n### 2.1 Overall success rates\n\n| Study | Sample & Method | Success definition | Overall success rate |\n|-------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007) \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* | 221 cases (UN, US, EU, etc.) 1945\u20112005; logistic regression | *Policy change* (withdrawal, negotiation, or concession) within 5 years | **\u2248 34\u202f%** (\u2248 1\u2011in\u20113) |\n| Peksen (2019) \u2013 *The Effectiveness of Sanctions: A Bayesian Meta\u2011analysis* | 1,000+ sanction episodes (post\u2011Cold War) | Same as above, plus \u201cpartial compliance\u201d | **\u2248 45\u202f%** for *targeted* (individual or sector) sanctions; **\u2248 20\u202f%** for *comprehensive* trade embargoes |\n| Drezner (2011) \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox* | Event\u2011study of 37 major sanctions (1990\u20112008) | Regime change or policy reversal | **\u2248 22\u202f%** |\n| Lektzian & Souva (2022) \u2013 *Sanctions and Regime Survival* | Panel of 150 authoritarian regimes, 1990\u20112020 | Regime durability (no overthrow) | Sanctions *reduce* regime survival probability by **5\u2011",
