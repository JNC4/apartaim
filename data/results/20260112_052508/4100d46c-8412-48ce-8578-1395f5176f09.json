      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Pasteurized milk** has been heat\u2011treated to destroy virtually all disease\u2011causing bacteria that can be present in fresh milk.  The process reduces the risk of food\u2011borne illness by\u202f>\u202f99.999\u202f% (5\u20137\u202flog reductions) for the most common pathogens.  \n- **Raw milk** (milk that has never been heat\u2011treated) can contain the same bacteria that pasteurization eliminates.  Outbreak data show that raw\u2011milk consumption is associated with a markedly higher incidence of bacterial gastro\u2011enteritis, especially in vulnerable groups (young children, pregnant people, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients).\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based comparison of the safety issues for each type of milk.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

How pasteurization kills (or inactivates) the microorganisms that make raw milk unsafe  \n\n| Step | What the heat does to a bacterial cell (or a virus) | How the standard **HTST** (high\u2011temperature short\u2011time) pasteurization regime (72\u202f\u00b0C/161\u202f\u00b0F for 15\u202fs) achieves it |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Denaturation of proteins** | Bacterial enzymes, structural proteins, and membrane proteins unfold and lose their three\u2011dimensional shape when exposed to temperatures above their thermal stability.  When key enzymes (e.g., those that synthesize DNA, repair damage, or maintain the cell wall) are denatured the cell can no longer carry out vital metabolic processes. | 72\u202f\u00b0C is well above the denaturation temperature of most bacterial enzymes (most begin to unfold >\u202f55\u202f\u00b0C).  In 15\u202fs the cumulative heat dose (temperature\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime) is enough to cause >\u202f90\u202f% loss of enzyme activity in *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli*, *Campylobacter* and *Listeria* cells. |\n| **Disruption of the cell membrane & wall** | Heat increases fluidity of the phospholipid bilayer, causing leaks, loss of ion gradients, and eventual rupture.  For Gram\u2011negative bacteria (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*) the outer membrane is especially heat\u2011sensitive. | The rapid rise to 72\u202f\u00b0C creates a \u201cthermal shock\u201d that breaks the outer membrane of Gram\u2011negative organisms within seconds.  For Gram\u2011positive *Listeria* the thicker peptidoglycan layer offers a little more resistance, but the same temperature still causes lethal damage. |\n| **DNA damage** | High temperature can cause depurination and strand breaks, especially when combined with reactive oxygen species generated during heating.  Even sub\u2011lethal DNA lesions prevent replication. | At 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs, the rate of depurination is enough to create multiple lesions per genome in fast\u2011growing bacteria; repair systems are already compromised by protein denaturation, so the cell cannot recover. |\n| **Inactivation of viruses** | Enveloped viruses (e.g., bovine viral diarrhea virus, some rotaviruses) lose their lipid envelope; non\u2011enveloped viruses (e.g., norovirus) are denatured at similar temperatures. | 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs reduces viral infectivity by >\u202f5\u202flog for most milk\u2011borne viruses. |\n| **Spore resistance** | Bacterial spores (e.g., *Bacillus cereus*, *Clostridium* spp.) are highly heat\u2011resistant; a standard HTST pasteurization does **not** reliably kill them. | Because spores are not the primary cause of severe acute food\u2011borne illness from milk (they generally cause only mild, later\u2011onset spoilage or diarrheal illness), they are tolerated.

Rapid cooling** | Milk is quickly cooled to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F) to prevent any surviving psychrotrophic (cold\u2011tolerant) bacteria from multiplying. | Cool to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C within 30\u202fmin of the end of the heat\u2011hold. | Psychrotrophic spoilage organisms (e.g., *Pseudomonas* spp.) can still grow at refrigeration temperatures, but they are **non\u2011pathogenic** for healthy people. Cooling arrests the growth of any residual microbes, extending shelf\u2011life. |\n| **4. Homogenisation (optional, not part of pasteurisation)** | Breaks fat globules to improve texture; does not affect microbial safety. | High\u2011pressure pump through a small\u2011orifice nozzle (\u2248\u202f2,000\u202fpsi). | No impact on pathogen kill. |\n\n### Why heat kills pathogens\n\n1. **Protein denaturation** \u2013 Enzymes required for metabolism (e.g., DNA polymerase, ribosomal proteins) unfold irreversibly above ~55\u202f\u00b0C, halting replication.  \n2. **Membrane disruption** \u2013 Phospholipid bilayers become fluid and leak, causing loss of ion gradients.  \n3. **Nucleic\u2011acid damage** \u2013 High temperature accelerates depurination and strand breakage.  \n4. **Spore inactivation (partial)** \u2013 While most bacterial spores survive standard pasteurisation, the *regulatory* goal is not to kill spores but to **eliminate vegetative cells** that cause acute disease. Spores that survive (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum* type\u202fE) are unable to germinate at refrigeration temperatures and typically require a longer, higher\u2011temperature treatment (e.g., UHT or sterilisation) to",
