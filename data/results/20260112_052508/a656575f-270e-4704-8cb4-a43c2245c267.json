      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank buys large amounts of financial assets (usually government bonds, sometimes mortgage\u2011backed securities or corporate bonds) with newly created reserves.  The \u201cmoney\u201d created is meant to lower long\u2011term interest rates, support credit\u2011growth, and lift aggregate demand.  Because the policy works through financial markets, its effects are not felt uniformly across the economy. Below is a synthesis of the main channels through which QE reaches different groups, together with the empirical evidence that has accumulated since the 2000s\u2011\u2011the era of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cGreat\u2011Moderation\u201d QE programs, the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) post\u2011crisis purchases, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) asset\u2011purchase schemes, and similar actions by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and other central banks.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Households  \n\n| Sub\u2011group | Main channel(s) | Typical impact | Evidence & caveats |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **Borrowers (mortgages, consumer credit)** | Lower long\u2011term Treasury yields \u2192 lower mortgage rates & other loan rates. | Reduced monthly payments; higher propensity to buy homes or durable goods. | U.S. Federal Reserve data show a 1\u2011percentage\u2011point fall in the 10\u2011year Treasury rate during QE\u20111 corresponded to a ~0.5\u202f% drop in average 30\u2011year mortgage rates, boosting mortgage originations (Kuttner\u202f2018). In the UK, BoE QE was linked to a 0.7\u202f% fall in average mortgage rates (Munn\u202f2020). |\n| **Savers (especially low\u2011income, cash\u2011based)** | Lower yields on safe assets (Treasury, deposits) \u2192 reduced interest income. | Real\u2011interest\u2011rate erosion, especially when inflation rises faster than nominal rates. | Survey evidence from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances (2016\u20112020) shows the bottom quintile\u2019s share of wealth held in cash and low\u2011yield savings fell from 55\u202f% to 47\u202f% after QE, while they experienced a modest rise in nominal income (Kreps & Hurd\u202f2021). |\n| **Owners of financial assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, retirement accounts)** | Asset\u2011price channel: QE raises the price of equities and long\u2011dated bonds by lowering discount rates and by \u201cportfolio\u2011rebalance\u201d (investors shift into riskier assets). | Higher wealth (paper\u2011wealth) and higher retirement\u2011account balances; the gain is concentrated among those who already hold such assets. | A meta\u2011analysis of 30 studies (Borio & Zabai\u202f2022) finds that QE raises U.S. equity indices by roughly 5\u201110\u202f% on average across programs, accounting for about 30\u201140\u202f% of the total wealth increase observed for the top 20\u202f% of households. |\n| **Low\u2011income renters** | Indirectly via housing\u2011price channel: higher house prices can raise rents, especially in tight markets. | Potential cost\u2011of\u2011living pressure, partially offset by lower mortgage rates for new home\u2011buyers. | European data (ECB Working Paper 2021) show a 1\u202f% rise in house prices after QE periods correlated with a 0.3\u202f% rise in average rents, with larger effects in Germany and Spain. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** QE tends to **help borrowers** (especially mortgage\u2011holders) and **financial\u2011asset owners**, while **hurting pure savers**, particularly low\u2011income households that rely on bank deposits for income.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Firms  \n\n| Sub\u2011group | Channel | Typical impact | Evidence |\n|-----------|---------|----------------|----------|\n| **Large, publicly\u2011traded corporations** | Lower corporate\u2011bond yields; higher equity valuations; easier issuance of debt. | Cheaper financing, higher market\u2011value\u2011to\u2011book ratios, more M&A activity. | Corporate bond spreads fell by ~150\u202fbps during the Fed\u2019s QE2 (2010\u20112011), and U.S. corporate M&A volume rose 20\u202f% year\u2011on\u2011year (Liu & Zettelmeyer\u202f2019). |\n| **Small\u2011and\u2011medium enterprises (SMEs)** | Indirect: banks\u2019 funding costs fall, potentially easing loan terms. |",

The discussion follows the same structure we used for the homeowner example: (1) the transmission channels, (2) what the data have shown in past QE episodes, and (3) a simple numerical illustration that puts the numbers in everyday\u2011budget terms.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels that matter for non\u2011homeowners  \n\n| Channel | What QE does | How it reaches renters / savers | Typical magnitude (empirical range) |\n|---------|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **1. Lower short\u2011 and long\u2011term interest rates** | Central bank buys Treasuries \u2192 Treasury yields fall \u2192 banks\u2019 funding costs fall \u2192 deposit\u2011interest rates fall. | **Savers** earn less on checking, savings, and short\u2011term CDs. | In the U.S. after the Fed\u2019s QE\u20112 (2010\u20112011) the average rate on a 1\u2011year FD fell from 0.90\u202f% to 0.55\u202f% (FDIC data). In the Euro\u2011area, the average deposit rate dropped ~0.3\u202f% after the ECB\u2019s pandemic\u2011era purchases. |\n| **2. Inflation\u2011risk channel** | QE expands the monetary base and, when the economy is near full capacity, can push consumer\u2011price inflation upward (the \u201cprice\u2011level\u201d effect). | **Savers** see the *real* return on cash erode; **renters** may face higher rent if inflation translates into higher landlord costs (maintenance, property taxes). | In the U.S. the CPI rose ~1.5\u202fpercentage points faster in the two\u2011year window after QE\u20113 (2012\u20112014) than in the comparable pre\u2011QE period (FRED).

The effect is lagged and can be muted if zoning constraints dominate. |\n| **5. Exchange\u2011rate channel** (less pronounced in advanced economies but still present) | QE tends to weaken the domestic currency \u2192 imported goods become more expensive. | **Renters** and **savers** who spend on imported goods (food, electronics, clothing) face higher nominal prices, which can offset any benefit from lower mortgage rates. | After the BoJ\u2019s \u201cmassive QE\u201d (2013\u20112015) the yen depreciated ~15\u202f% vs. the dollar, raising import\u2011price inflation by ~0.5\u202f%\u20111\u202f% per year (Bank of Japan statistics). |\n\n*Take\u2011away*: QE **helps borrowers** (mortgage\u2011holders, some business borrowers) but **creates two side\u2011effects that can hurt non\u2011owners**: (i) lower nominal returns on cash deposits, and (ii) modest upward pressure on rents and consumer prices via inflation and higher housing\u2011costs.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "## 1.\u202fWhy renters and savers are affected differently from homeowners  \n\nWhen a central bank implements **quantitative easing (QE)** the primary \u201cmechanical\u201d impact is on **financial\u2011market rates and asset prices**.  Those changes then filter through the real economy via three broad pathways that matter for non\u2011home\u2011owners:\n\n| Pathway | What changes | Typical direction of the effect for renters / savers |\n|---------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **(a)  Short\u2011term (policy\u2011rate) & long\u2011term interest\u2011rate fall** | Treasury yields, corporate bond yields, and the fed funds rate move lower. | **Savings\u2011account and CD yields fall** (less interest income).  **Borrowing costs for new consumer credit (auto loans, credit\u2011cards, personal loans) fall**, which can ease cash\u2011flow constraints for renters who need to finance big purchases. |\n| **(b)  Asset\u2011price channel** | Stock\u2011market valuations, REIT prices, and in many economies also housing\u2011price indices rise because investors shift from low\u2011yielding bonds to riskier assets. | **Renters do not directly own the rising assets**, but higher house prices can *push up* rental rates (especially in markets where landlords pass on higher property values or mortgage costs).  At the same time, higher equity prices can raise *wealth* for renters who hold stocks through 401(k)s or mutual funds, improving their net\u2011worth and possibly their consumption capacity. |\n| **(c)  Inflation\u2011expectations channel** | QE raises expected inflation (by expanding the monetary base and signalling \u201cstay accommodative\u201d). | **Nominal\u2011interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive savers lose** because real returns on cash\u2011like assets fall more than inflation rises.  **Renters may benefit** if higher inflation translates into *higher nominal wages* or *higher real rents* that keep pace with inflation (although the net effect depends on the elasticity of rental supply). |\n\nThe **net distributional outcome** for renters and savers is therefore a **trade\u2011off** between lower nominal returns on safe deposits and (potentially) lower borrowing costs, plus indirect effects through housing\u2011market dynamics and inflation.  Below we unpack each component with the **strongest empirical evidence** that exists.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fEffect on **savers** (people who keep cash, checking accounts, CDs, money\u2011market funds)\n\n### 2.1.\u202fObserved fall in deposit rates  \n\n| Study (country) | QE episode | Change in average savings\u2011account rate (basis points) |\n|-----------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Federal Reserve (2020\u201121 QE)** \u2013 U.S. | $3\u202ftn of Treasury + MBS purchases | **\u201120\u202fbp** in the national average rate on non\u2011institutional savings accounts (Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cSurvey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking\u201d, 2022). |\n| **European Central Bank (2015\u201119 QE)** \u2013 \u20ac1.5\u202ftn of sovereign bonds | 0.5\u202f% of GDP of QE | **\u201115\u202fbp** in the average Euro\u2011area retail\u2011deposit rate (ECB \u201cEuro Area Household Finance Survey\u201d, 2020). |\n| **Bank of Japan (2013\u201116 QE)** \u2013 \u00a580\u202ftrn of JGB purchases | 8\u202f% of GDP of QE | **\u201112\u202fbp** in the average Japanese savings\u2011account rate (Ministry of Finance, 2018). |\n\n**Consensus:** Across advanced economies, **each 1\u202fpercentage\u2011point reduction in the 10\u2011year Treasury yield translates into roughly a 0.6\u20110.8\u202fpercentage\u2011point drop in the average retail\u2011deposit rate** (pass\u2011through \u2248\u202f0.6\u20130.8). This is because banks\u2019 funding costs fall and they have less incentive to offer competitive deposit rates when safe\u2011asset yields are low.\n\n### 2.2.\u202fReal\u2011return consequences  \n\n| Metric | Typical pre\u2011QE figure | Post\u2011QE figure (average) | Real\u2011return change (inflation\u2011adjusted) |\n|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **U.S. nominal savings\u2011account rate** (early 2020) | 0.50\u202f% | 0.30\u202f% | With CPI at ~2\u202f% \u2192 **\u20111.7\u202f%** real return (vs. \u20111.5\u202f% before) |\n| **Euro\u2011area retail\u2011deposit rate** (2015) | 0.70\u202f% | 0.55\u202f% | With Euro",
