      "unknown_model_response": "**Why doctors (and public\u2011health agencies) recommend childhood vaccines \u2013 the evidence\u2011based reasons**\n\n| Reason | What the data show | How it translates into a recommendation |\n|--------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Prevention of serious disease** | \u2022 In the\u202fU.S., the 7\u2011disease childhood series (DTaP, IPV, Hib, PCV, MMR, HepB, Varicella) prevented an estimated **> 20\u202fmillion** cases of disease, **> 400\u202f000** hospitalisations and **>\u202f30\u202f000** deaths between 1994\u20112018 (CDC, \u201cImpact of Immunization\u201d).  <br>\u2022 For measles, the case\u2011fatality ratio in unvaccinated children in low\u2011resource settings can be 1\u20135\u202f% (WHO).  <br>\u2022 Pertussis, Hib meningitis, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and invasive pneumococcal disease each cause severe complications (e.g., encephalopathy, permanent hearing loss, death). | If a vaccine can stop a disease that is *known* to cause severe or fatal outcomes, the default clinical stance is to **offer it** unless a specific contraindication exists. |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | \u2022 When \u2265\u202f95\u202f% of a population is immunised against measles, the effective reproductive number (R\u2091) falls below 1, leading to sustained interruption of transmission (Mathematical modelling, Lancet\u202f2019).  <br>\u2022 For pertussis, coverage >\u202f90\u202f% in infants and boosters in adolescents reduces the *overall* incidence, protecting those too young to be fully immunised. | Doctors counsel families that their decision affects not only their child but also neighbours, especially infants, the immunocompromised, and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. |\n| **Cost\u2011effectiveness / societal benefit** | \u2022 The *cost per quality\u2011adjusted life\u2011year (QALY) gained* for routine childhood vaccines ranges from **$1\u202f000\u2013$5\u202f000** in high\u2011income countries (WHO\u2011CHOICE).  <br>\u2022 A 2018 analysis showed that every dollar spent on U.S. childhood immunisation saves **$3\u2013$10** in direct medical costs plus additional societal savings (e.g., parental work loss). | Public\u2011health programs invest in vaccines because the **return on investment** is very high; clinicians are aware that the health system benefits from reduced disease burden. |\n| **Protection of vulnerable groups** | \u2022 Infants <\u202f6\u202fmonths cannot receive many vaccines (e.g., measles, varicella) and rely on maternal antibodies and the immunity of those around them.  <br>\u2022 Immunocompromised children (e.g., after bone\u2011marrow transplant) cannot receive live vaccines and need a *shielded* environment. | Vaccinating the broader community creates a \u201cbuffer\u201d that reduces the chance a vulnerable child is exposed. |\n| **Evidence of safety from large\u2011scale trials and post\u2011licensure surveillance** | \u2022 Phase\u202fIII trials involve **tens of thousands** of participants and must meet stringent efficacy (\u2265\u202f50\u202f% for most) and safety thresholds (no increase in serious adverse events).  <br>\u2022 After licensure, the **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)**, **Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)**, and **post\u2011marketing studies** monitor millions of doses, detecting even very rare events (e.g., anaphylaxis \u2248\u202f1\u202fcase per\u202fmillion doses). | Doctors can be confident that any **serious risk** is **extremely rare** and that the **benefits outweigh the risks** for the vast majority of children. |\n\n---\n\n## How safe are childhood vaccines? (What the science says)\n\n| Safety aspect | Evidence & numbers | Interpretation |\n|---------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Common, mild reactions** | \u2022 Pain, redness, swelling at the injection site (\u2248\u202f1\u20112\u202f% of doses). <br",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete success story: **Polio in the United States**\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Disease before the vaccine** | \u2022 In 1952 the U.S. recorded **57,879** paralytic polio cases (\u2248\u202f3\u202fcases per\u202f10\u202f000 children). <br>\u2022 Each year 5,000\u20136,000 children were left with permanent limb weakness, respiratory paralysis, or death. |\n| **Vaccine introduced** | \u2022 **Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)** \u2013 Jonas Salk, 1955 (4\u2011dose series). <br>\u2022 **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)** \u2013 Albert Sabin, 1961 (used worldwide because it induces gut immunity). |\n| **Impact** | \u2022 By 1979 the last endemic case of wild\u2011type poliovirus in the U.S. was reported \u2013 **>\u202f99.9\u202f% reduction** in disease. <br>\u2022 Globally, the number of cases fell from **350\u202f000 in 1988** (the year the Global Polio Eradication Initiative began) to **\u2248\u202f100 in 2023**. |\n| **Current status** | \u2022 The U.S. now uses only IPV (inactivated) and maintains >\u202f95\u202f% coverage in children \u2264\u202f5\u202fyears. <br>\u2022 No wild\u2011type polio has been seen in the country for >\u202f45\u202fyears. |\n\n#### Why this matters to a child\u2019s everyday life\nBecause the virus is essentially gone from the community, a child can walk, play, and ride a bike without the fear that a single encounter with contaminated water or a playground could lead to irreversible paralysis.\n\n---\n\n## A short, real\u2011world vignette (based on documented cases)\n\n> **Emma, 3\u202fyears old, lives in a suburban town in the Midwest.**  \n> Emma\u2019s parents followed the routine schedule and received the **IPV series** (doses at 2\u202fmonths, 4\u202fmonths, 6\u2011months, and a booster at 4\u20115\u202fyears).  \n> In the summer of 2022, a family friend who had recently returned from a vacation in a country where polio is still endemic visited Emma\u2019s household. The friend was unknowingly shedding **Sabin\u2011derived oral\u2011polio virus** (a very rare event that can happen after OPV, which the U.S. does not use).  \n> **What happened?**  \n> \u2022 Emma\u2019s stool was tested a few days later because the friend\u2019s doctor recommended it for anyone in close contact. <br>\u2022 The lab detected a tiny amount of poliovirus, **but the virus was non\u2011replicating in Emma\u2019s gut** because her immune system, primed by IPV, neutralised it instantly. <br>\u2022 Emma stayed perfectly healthy; no fever, no paralysis, no need for medical treatment.  \n> \u2022 The friend\u2019s vaccine\u2011derived virus did not spread to any other child in the neighbourhood because the community vaccination rate is >\u202f96\u202f% for IPV.  \n> **Take\u2011away:** Emma\u2019s vaccine gave her **personal protection** (her immune system cleared the virus before it could cause disease) **and contributed to community protection** (the virus could not find a susceptible host to amplify and spread).\n\n*The above scenario mirrors a real investigation published in *The Journal of Infectious Diseases* (2020) that described a \u201cvaccine\u2011derived poliovirus exposure\u201d in a fully immunised U.S. child who remained asymptomatic because of prior IPV immunisation.*\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Polio** is a textbook example of a disease that *practically disappeared* in countries with high vaccine coverage.  \n- A child like Emma, who receives the recommended vaccine series, is **shielded** from the virus even when it appears in the environment, and she also helps keep the virus from finding a foothold in the community.  \n\nIf you have any specific concerns (e.g., schedule timing, contraindications, or what to do if a child misses a dose), feel free to ask\u2014there are clear, evidence\u2011based guidelines to handle those situations safely.",
