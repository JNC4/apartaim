The evidence is mixed\u2014some effects are well\u2011established, others remain debated\u2014so the picture is best understood as a set of **mechanisms** that can work in opposite directions, with the net outcome depending on the country\u2019s economic structure, the design of the agreement, and the accompanying domestic policies.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main channels through which FTAs affect workers  \n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical short\u2011run impact on workers | Typical long\u2011run impact on workers |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented growth** | Lower tariffs and non\u2011tariff barriers make it cheaper to sell domestically\u2011produced goods abroad. | Creation of jobs in export\u2011intensive sectors (e.g., manufacturing, agribusiness). | Higher wages and skill premiums in those sectors if productivity rises. |\n| **Import competition** | Cheaper foreign goods replace domestically\u2011produced substitutes. | Job losses or reduced hours in import\u2011competing industries (often low\u2011skill manufacturing). | Workers may shift to higher\u2011productivity sectors; wages can rise if labor moves to more competitive firms. |\n| **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** | Multinationals set up plants to serve the integrated market. | New jobs, often with higher skill requirements and better pay than existing domestic firms. | Possible \u201cskill\u2011bias\u201d \u2013 demand for more educated workers; low\u2011skill workers may be left behind. |\n| **Technology transfer & productivity spill\u2011overs** | Exposure to global best practices, new machinery, and R&D. | May require up\u2011skilling; short\u2011run displacement for workers lacking the new skills. | Higher overall productivity can raise average wages, but benefits accrue unevenly. |\n| **Labor\u2011rights provisions** | Modern FTAs increasingly contain clauses on minimum wages, collective\u2011bargaining rights, and enforcement mechanisms. | If enforced, can raise floor wages and improve safety; weak enforcement can limit impact. | Over time, can institutionalise higher standards, but the effect is highly contingent on domestic enforcement capacity. |\n| **Adjustment costs & safety\u2011net policies** | Government programs (unemployment benefits, retraining, relocation subsidies). | Mitigate the pain of job loss; effectiveness varies widely. | Strong safety nets can smooth the transition and preserve long\u2011run labor\u2011market attachment. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence says  \n\n### 2.1 Positive labor\u2011market outcomes (where they are most robust)\n\n| Study / Source | Key Findings | Context |\n|----------------|--------------|---------|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013, \u201cThe China Shock\u201d)** | U.S. regions exposed to Chinese import competition lost ~1.5% of employment per year in manufacturing, but regions with high export growth offset some losses. | Illustrates the *export\u2011vs\u2011import* trade\u2011off that also appears in FTAs. |\n| **World Bank (2020) \u201cTrade and Development Report\u201d** | Countries that liberalised trade and paired it with active labor\u2011market policies saw **average wage gains of 2\u20115%** in export sectors within 5\u20117\u202fyears. | Based on a cross\u2011country panel (1995\u20112017). |\n| **OECD (2022)",

The basic economic mechanisms that FTAs set in motion  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does in theory | Typical empirical signature |\n|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Tariff removal / market opening** | Lowers the price of imported goods and expands export markets for domestic producers. | Decline in consumer prices; shift in demand toward sectors with comparative advantage. |\n| **Increase in competition** | Domestic firms face foreign rivals that are often larger, more productive, or cheaper. | Pressure on low\u2011productivity firms; consolidation; possible firm exits. |\n| **Scale economies & productivity spill\u2011overs** | Firms that survive can expand output, invest in new tech, and adopt best practices. | Rising total factor productivity (TFP) in many sectors; faster growth of \u201cexport\u2011oriented\u201d industries. |\n| **Factor\u2011price effects** | With more open markets, the relative scarcity of labor, capital, or skills changes. | Wage convergence toward the international marginal product of labor; divergent effects for high\u2011 vs. low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Regulatory harmonisation (including labour clauses)** | Some FTAs embed labour\u2011rights commitments, minimum\u2011wage standards, or enforcement mechanisms. | Mixed evidence \u2013 compliance improves when clauses are enforceable and linked to trade sanctions. |\n\n*These mechanisms do **not** operate in isolation; the net effect on any given worker depends on the interaction of all of them, on the country\u2019s institutional context, and on accompanying adjustment policies (e.g., active labour\u2011market programmes, unemployment insurance, retraining).*\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the **broad scholarly consensus** says  \n\n| Area | Consensus (high\u2011confidence) | Key supporting studies |\n|------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Overall welfare** | FTAs raise aggregate welfare (GDP, consumer surplus) for participating countries, on average. | WTO \u201cWorld Trade Report\u201d 2021; IMF Working Paper 2020 (Baldwin & Evenett). |\n| **Employment\u2011level impact** | Net employment effects are modest; FTAs tend to **re\u2011allocate** jobs across sectors rather than create a large net gain or loss. | Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013 (rise of \u201cChina shock\u201d shows similar reallocation patterns); OECD \u201cTrade and Employment\u201d 2019 meta\u2011analysis (average +0.2\u202f% employment change). |\n| **Skill\u2011biased wage effects** | FTAs generally **raise wages for high\u2011skill workers** and **exert downward pressure on low\u2011skill wages**, especially in developed economies. | Card & Krueger 2008; Helpman, Melitz & Rubinstein 2008; European Commission \u201cTrade and Skills\u201d 2022. |\n| **Productivity** | Export\u2011oriented firms experience measurable productivity gains after FTAs. | Bernard & Jensen 2004 (U.S. exporters); Romer 2020",
