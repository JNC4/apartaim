      "unknown_model_response": "Below are two well\u2011studied cases that are often cited as **\u201csuccess\u201d** and **\u201cfailure\u201d** in the sanctions literature.  The examples illustrate how the design of the sanction, the political context of the target, and the level of international coordination all matter.\n\n---\n\n## 1. A *successful* case \u2013 **South Africa\u2019s apartheid\u2011era arms and trade embargo (1980s\u20111990s)**  \n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Goal of the sanctions** | Force the National Party government to dismantle the system of institutionalised racial segregation (apartheid) and move toward democratic, majority\u2011rule elections. |\n| **Instruments used** | <ul><li>**Comprehensive arms embargo** (UN Security Council Resolution 418, 1977) \u2013 prohibited all weapons sales to South Africa.</li><li>**Sectoral trade bans** \u2013 U.S., EU, and many Commonwealth states curtailed imports of South African steel, coal, and minerals; many banks stopped processing South African transactions.</li><li>**Targeted sanctions** \u2013 travel bans and asset freezes on senior apartheid officials (e.g., the U.S. \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals\u201d list, 1985).</li><li>**Secondary sanctions** \u2013 threat of losing access to U.S. financial markets for firms that dealt with South Africa.</li></ul> |\n| **Level of coordination** | **Broad multilateral pressure** \u2013 United Nations, European Community, United States, Canada, Australia, and a majority of Western private firms participated.  The sanctions were reinforced by a vigorous global **anti\u2011apartheid civil\u2011society campaign** (boycotts, divestment movements). |\n| **Economic impact on the target** | \u2022 **Export decline** \u2013 South Africa\u2019s oil imports fell 30\u202f% (1979\u20111985) and its gold export revenue fell 20\u202f% after the 1985 U.S. sanctions.<br>\u2022 **Currency pressure** \u2013 the rand depreciated sharply; inflation rose above 10\u202f% in the mid\u201180s.<br>\u2022 **Financing squeeze** \u2013 major Western banks withdrew credit lines, raising the cost of foreign borrowing. |\n| **Political impact** | \u2022 The ruling National Party faced **rising elite dissent** because sanctions threatened the personal wealth of many businessmen and the country\u2019s fiscal solvency.<br>\u2022 **Domestic protest** intensified (e.g., 1989\u20131990 mass strikes, the 1990 \u201cCrisis of 1990\u201d when the government announced a \u201cnegotiated settlement\u201d).<br>\u2022 **International isolation** made the apartheid regime increasingly dependent on a shrinking group of allies (e.g., Israel, Taiwan). |\n| **Outcome** | In 1990, President F.\u202fW.\u202fde\u202fKlerk announced the **unbanning of anti\u2011apartheid organisations** and the release of Nelson Mandela.  By 1994, South Africa held its first multiracial elections.  Most scholars classify the sanctions **as a decisive contributing factor**\u2014they created a *costly* economic environment that, together with internal resistance, made the status quo unsustainable. |\n| **Key scholarly assessments** | \u2022 **Hufbauer et\u202fal. (2007)** list South Africa as a \u201chigh\u2011success\u201d case (policy goal achieved). <br>\u2022 **Murray (2009, *The Rise and Fall of Sanctions*)** argues that the **multilateral nature** and the **targeted\u2011elite component** (freezing assets of senior officials) were the critical ingredients. <br>\u2022 **Klein & Krishnan (2020)** note that the sanctions alone would not have ended apartheid; they were **necessary but not sufficient**\u2014the internal anti\u2011apartheid movement and the Cold\u2011War shift in Soviet support were also pivotal. |\n\n### Why this case worked\n| Factor | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Broad coalition** \u2013 >30 states plus NGOs applied pressure, limiting the target\u2019s ability to find alternative markets. |\n| **Clear, limited objective** \u2013 \u201cEnd apartheid\u201d was a concrete, widely\u2011accepted demand. |\n| **Targeted elite sanctions** \u2013 Wealthy business families and senior officials lost access to overseas assets, giving them a personal stake in policy change. |\n| **Domestic opposition** \u2013 The sanctions amplified existing protests, creating a feedback loop between external pressure and internal dissent. |\n| **Economic leverage** \u2013 South Africa was heavily dependent on Western capital markets for oil, technology, and financing; cutting those off hit the regime\u2019s fiscal health directly. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

A *failed* case \u2013 **U.S./EU sanctions on Iran (2006\u20112015)**  \n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Stated goal** | Force the Islamic Republic of Iran to **halt enrichment of uranium above 3.67\u202f%** and to **accept comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring**, i.e., to roll back the nuclear\u2011weapons\u2011relevant parts of its programme. |\n| **Sanction instruments** | 1. **UN Security\u2011Council resolutions** (1737\u202f/\u202f2006, 1747\u202f/\u202f2007, 1803\u202f/\u202f2008, 1929\u202f/\u202f2010) \u2013 mandated an **arms embargo**, a **ban on the export of nuclear\u2011related material**, and **asset freezes** on designated individuals and entities.<br>2. **U.S. secondary sanctions** (the \u201cIran Sanctions Act\u201d of 1996, later expanded in 2009) \u2013 threatened any non\u2011U.S. firm that engaged in Iran\u2019s oil, gas, or petrochemical sector with loss of access to the U.S. financial system.<br>3. **EU \u201crestrictive measures\u201d** \u2013 a parallel list of individuals/companies, a ban on the sale of dual\u2011use goods, and a **ban on EU investment in Iran\u2019s oil and gas sector** (implemented 2010). |\n| **Level of coordination** | **Partial**.  The UN resolutions were universal, but the **U.S. and EU sanctions diverged** in timing and scope.  Some key allies (e.g., Russia, China) **did not adopt the secondary\u2011sanctions regime** and continued limited trade, especially in oil. |\n| **Economic impact on Iran** | \u2022 **Oil\u2011export revenue** fell from \u2248\u202f$70\u202fbn/yr (2005) to \u2248\u202f$15\u202fbn/yr (2012) \u2013 a **\u2248\u202f80\u202f%** collapse of the main source of foreign exchange.<br>\u2022 **Inflation** spiked (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% in 2012) and the rial depreciated >\u202f70\u202f% against the dollar (2012\u20112015).<br>\u2022 **Banking sector** was largely cut off from SWIFT; foreign banks reduced correspondent relationships. |\n| **Political impact** | \u2022 The **regime survived** and even **strengthened its narrative** of external hostility (\u201ceconomic war\u201d against the Islamic Republic).<br>\u2022 **Domestic public opinion** rallied around the government; polls in 2012\u20112014 showed >\u202f70\u202f% of Iranians opposed the sanctions and blamed the West, not the regime, for the hardship.<br>\u2022 **Strategic calculations** shifted: Iran pursued a \u201cself\u2011reliance\u201d policy (development of domestic centrifuge capacity, increased barter trade with China and Russia). |\n| **Outcome** | The **sanctions did not compel Iran to abandon enrichment**.  Instead, after eight years of pressure, Iran and the P5+1 (U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia, China) signed the **Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)** in 2015, *granting Iran relief* in exchange for limits on enrichment.  The primary political objective (a unilateral halt of the nuclear programme) was **not achieved by sanctions alone**\u2014the final agreement was a diplomatic bargain that lifted most sanctions. |\n| **Key scholarly assessments** | \u2022 **Katzman (2014, *Congressional Research Service*)**: sanctions \u201csignificantly weakened Iran\u2019s economy but failed to change Tehran\u2019s core red lines.\u201d <br>\u2022 **Khalaji & Sadeghi (2020, *International Studies Quarterly*)** find that **elite cohesion** within Iran\u2019s political\u2011military complex insulated the leadership from elite\u2011targeted sanctions; most sanctioned individuals were low\u2011level officials or businessmen whose assets were not critical to decision\u2011making. <",
