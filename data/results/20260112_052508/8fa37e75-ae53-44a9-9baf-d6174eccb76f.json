How a 5\u202fG cellular network is built and how the towers (or \u201cbase stations\u201d) work  \n\n| Element | What it is | What it does in a 5\u202fG network |\n|---------|------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Core network** | Central data\u2011processing and routing facilities (often virtualised in the cloud). | Manages authentication, mobility, internet\u2011gateway functions, and connects the radio part to the wider internet. |\n| **Radio Access Network (RAN)** | The \u201clast\u2011mile\u201d that talks to your phone. It consists of **base stations** (the \u201ccell towers\u201d) and the antennas that are mounted on them. | Sends and receives radio\u2011frequency (RF) signals to/from user equipment (UE). 5\u202fG RAN is split into two frequency ranges: **FR1** (\u2248\u202f600\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f6\u202fGHz) and **FR2** (\u2248\u202f24\u202fGHz\u202f\u2013\u202f52\u202fGHz, often called \u201cmmWave\u201d). |\n| **Small cells / micro\u2011cells** | Low\u2011power, short\u2011range base stations (often placed on street furniture, building walls, or lamp\u2011posts). | Needed because higher\u2011frequency signals (especially mmWave) do not travel as far and are more easily blocked by obstacles. They fill coverage gaps and increase capacity. |\n| **Massive MIMO & beamforming** | Antenna arrays with dozens to hundreds of elements that can steer narrow beams electronically. | Rather than radiating equally in all directions, the base station can focus energy toward a specific device, improving data rates and reducing overall transmitted power. |\n| **Network slicing & software\u2011defined radio** | Virtual partitioning of the same physical infrastructure into separate logical \u201cslices\u201d that can be optimized for different services (e.g., ultra\u2011low\u2011latency for autonomous vehicles, massive IoT, broadband). | Allows the same tower to serve many different applications without needing separate hardware. |\n\n### Key technical points that matter for exposure\n\n| Concept | Typical numbers for a 5\u202fG base station (varies by site) |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Transmit power** | Macro\u2011cell sites: 10\u202fW\u202f\u2013\u202f40\u202fW per carrier (often lower than older 3G/4G sites because of beamforming). Small cells: <\u202f1\u202fW. |\n| **Antenna height** | Macro\u2011cells: 15\u202fm\u202f\u2013\u202f60\u202fm above ground. Small cells: 3\u202fm\u202f\u2013\u202f15\u202fm (often mounted on existing street furniture). |\n| **Duty cycle** | Continuous but the average power seen at any given location is reduced by beamforming and by the fact that the antenna radiates in a narrow, rotating pattern. |\n| **Frequency** | FR1 (\u2264\u202f6\u202fGHz) behaves similarly to existing 3G/4G signals. FR2 (mmWave, 24\u202fGHz\u202f+ ) is absorbed more quickly by walls, foliage, and even rain, so its range is only a few hundred metres. |\n| **Radiation pattern** | Directional \u201cpencil\u2011beams\u201d that sweep across the cell. The maximum power density is directly in front of the beam; elsewhere the field is much weaker. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the scientific literature says about health effects\n\n### 2.1 What type of radiation is involved?\n\n* 5\u202fG uses **non\u2011ionising radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields**.  \n* The photon energy (\u2248\u202f10\u207b\u2075\u202feV) is far below the ionisation threshold (\u2248\u202f10\u202feV).  Therefore RF cannot break chemical bonds or directly damage DNA the way ionising radiation (X\u2011rays, gamma rays) can.\n\n### 2.2 Established biological effect: **thermal heating**\n\n* When RF energy is absorbed by tissue, it is converted to heat.  \n* The amount of heating is proportional to **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)**, measured in watts per kilogram (W/kg).  \n* International safety limits (ICNIRP, IEEE, national regulators) are set so that the predicted temperature rise in the body is \u2264\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C for the general public and \u2264\u202f0.5\u202f\u00b0C for occupational exposure.  \n* All existing 5\u202f",

This lets a single carrier carry far more data. | Base\u2011station radios with software\u2011defined capabilities; the same hardware can switch between bands. |\n| **Beamforming / Massive MIMO** | Instead of radiating isotropically, the antenna array (often 64\u2011256 elements) shapes *narrow* beams that track a user\u2019s device in real time. The beam is \u201csteered\u201d electronically, not mechanically. | Large planar antenna panels on towers or small\u2011cell sites; each panel can form many simultaneous beams. |\n| **Network architecture** | A dense layer of **small cells** (spacing 50\u2011200\u202fm) is overlaid on the traditional macro\u2011cell grid. The small\u2011cell layer carries the high\u2011frequency traffic; the macro\u2011cell layer provides coverage and hand\u2011off. | Small cells are low\u2011power (typically \u2264\u202f1\u202fW EIRP for mmWave) and mounted on poles, lamp posts, building fa\u00e7ades. |\n| **Power levels** | *Effective Isotropic Radiated Power* (EIRP) for 5G is limited by national regulations. For example, in the U.S. the FCC caps mmWave EIRP at 32\u202fW (\u2248\u202f45\u202fdBm) for 28\u202fGHz; typical installations are far below that. | Power amplifiers, filters, and automatic gain control keep output within limits. |\n\n### How the RF field looks in the environment  \n\n* **Macro\u2011cell towers** (tens of metres tall) radiate at a few watts to a few tens of watts EIRP in the low\u2011/mid\u2011bands. Their beams are relatively wide (tens of degrees).  \n* **Small cells** are much closer to users (often <\u202f30\u202fm) but emit **much lower** power per antenna element (often <\u202f0.1\u202fW EIR",

Identify the *biological* effect that can actually occur** | The only *established* mechanism by which non\u2011ionising RF can harm tissue is **heating** (thermal effect). | If a limit prevents any measurable temperature rise, there can be no thermal damage. |\n| **2. Quantify the relationship between RF exposure and temperature rise** | Laboratory studies on humans and animal models measure **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)** \u2013 the power absorbed per kilogram of tissue (W\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9). They also calculate the resulting temperature increase (\u0394T). | SAR \u2192 \u0394T gives a physical link that can be modelled for any frequency, body shape, and exposure scenario. |\n| **3. Choose a \u201creference\u201d SAR that is known to be safe** | The International Commission on Non\u2011Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the IEEE set a **basic restriction** of **0.08\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9** (whole\u2011body) and **2\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9** (localized, e.g., head, trunk) for the general public. These values correspond to a temperature rise of **\u2264\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C** (whole body) and **\u2264\u202f0.5\u202f\u00b0C** (localised). | The 0.1\u202f\u00b0C rise is far below the threshold at which the body\u2019s thermoregulatory mechanisms (blood flow, sweating) are triggered, so it is considered a \u201cno\u2011effect\u201d level. |\n| **4. Convert SAR limits into *exposure* limits that can be measured in the field** | SAR is a *dosimetric* quantity that depends on the geometry of the source, the distance, the frequency, and the body\u2019s shape. Because it is impractical for inspectors to measure SAR directly, the limits are expressed in terms of **electric\u2011field strength (E)** or **power\u2011density (S)** that guarantee the SAR will stay below the reference value for any realistic scenario. This conversion uses **computational electromagnetic models** of a human (the \u201creference man\u201d) and the worst\u2011case orientation (e.g., head facing the source). | The resulting *basic limits* are easy to enforce with field\u2011measurement equipment (electric\u2011field meters, power\u2011density probes). |\n| **5. Apply safety (uncertainty) factors** | The conversion from SAR to field strength includes **large safety margins**: <br>\u2022 **10\u2011fold** margin for inter\u2011individual variability (children, elderly, people with implants). <br>\u2022 **10\u2011fold** margin for measurement uncertainties and modelling approximations. <br>Overall, the final public\u2011exposure limit is **\u2248\u202f100\u2011fold** lower than the SAR that would cause a 0.1\u202f\u00b0C temperature rise. | This \u201cbuffer\u201d ensures that even if a person is unusually sensitive or the model is imperfect, the exposure will still be far below any harmful level. |\n| **6. Frequency\u2011dependent limits** | At higher frequencies the RF energy is absorbed more superficially (skin depth shrinks).
