      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away  \n\n| Aspect | Raw (un\u2011pasteurized) milk | Pasteurized milk |\n|--------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| **Micro\u2011biological load** | Naturally contains the bacteria, yeasts and molds that were present in the cow\u2019s udder, on the farm environment, and in the milk itself.  Typical counts: 10\u00b3\u201110\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9, with occasional **pathogens** (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli*\u202fO157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*, *Staphylococcus aureus*). | Heat\u2011treated (usually 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 High\u2011Temperature Short\u2011Time, HTST) reduces total viable count by >5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 and **eliminates** >99.999\u202f% of recognized bacterial pathogens. Residual non\u2011pathogenic flora are usually <10\u00b2\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9. |\n| **Risk of food\u2011borne illness** | 1\u201310\u202fcases per 10\u202f000\u202fgallons sold (U.S. CDC data) \u2013 about 150\u202f\u2013\u202f200\u202foutbreaks in the U.S. from 1993\u20112022, most involving vulnerable people. | <1\u202fcase per 10\u202f000\u202fgallons sold; the CDC attributes **\u224899\u202f%** of all U.S. milk\u2011related outbreaks to raw milk. |\n| **Nutrient profile** | Very similar macronutrients (protein, fat, lactose). Small differences reported for heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011vitamins) and some enzymes (lipase, alkaline phosphatase). Evidence that these differences produce measurable health benefits is **inconclusive**. | Minimal loss of most nutrients; vitamin\u202fC may drop 10\u201120\u202f% and B\u2011vitamins 2\u20115\u202f% after HTST, but the milk still supplies the bulk of its nutritional value. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | 7\u201110\u202fdays under refrigeration (if kept cold from milking). Rapid bacterial growth can cause spoilage within a few days. | 14\u201121\u202fdays (or longer with ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) processing) because the residual flora are few and slower to multiply. |\n| **Legal status (U.S.)** | Legal to sell in 31 states (often only on\u2011farm or via herd\u2011share). Federal law prohibits interstate sale of raw milk for human consumption. | Legal nationwide; required to meet FDA Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) standards. |\n| **Typical consumers** | People seeking \u201ctraditional,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d or \u201cprobiotic\u201d foods; some claim digestive or allergy benefits. | The overwhelming majority of the population; especially recommended for children, pregnant people, elderly, immunocompromised. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based discussion of the safety differences, the scientific basis for those differences, and the contexts in which they matter most.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cpasteurization\u201d actually does\n\n| Process | Typical time/temperature | Primary effect |\n|---------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **HTST (High\u2011Temperature Short\u2011Time)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (most commercial milk) | 5\u2011log\u2081\u2080 reduction of *C.\u202fperfringens* spores; >7\u2011log\u2081\u2080 reduction of *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria*, *Campylobacter*. |\n| **LTLT (Low\u2011Temperature Long\u2011Time) \u2013 \u201cbatch\u201d** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Similar microbial kill, slightly more impact on heat\u2011sensitive vitamins. |\n| **UHT (Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temperature)** | 135\u2011150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20115\u202fs | >12\u2011log\u2081\u2080 kill of vegetative cells and most spores; allows shelf\u2011stable (ambient) milk. |\n\nThe **log\u2011reduction** concept is key: a 5\u2011log\u2081\u2080 reduction means a 100,000\u2011fold drop in viable microorganisms. If the raw milk contained 10\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 of a pathogen, after HTST you would expect <10\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9\u2014essentially undetectable and far below the dose that typically causes infection.\n\n### How the reduction is measured\n\n- **Standard plate counts** for total aerobic bacteria.\n-",

Any \u201cgood\u201d bacteria that were present are gone, so the milk no longer provides a live\u2011culture probiotic effect. |\n| **Enzymes that are naturally present in milk** | \u2022 **Lactase (\u03b2\u2011galactosidase)** \u2013 helps break down lactose.<br>\u2022 **Lipase** \u2013 hydrolyzes milk fat, contributing to flavor development.<br>\u2022 **Alkaline phosphatase** \u2013 a marker of raw milk quality; also involved in mineral metabolism.<br>\u2022 **Lysozyme**, **lactoperoxidase**, **xanthine oxidase**, **phosphatases**, **proteases** (e.g., plasmin). | Heat denatures most of these proteins.
