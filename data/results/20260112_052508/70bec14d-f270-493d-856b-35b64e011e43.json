The evidence is organized around three questions:\n\n1. **How do scholars measure \u201cinfluence\u201d or \u201csuccess\u201d?**  \n2. **What does the aggregate (cross\u2011national) evidence say?**  \n3. **What do the most\u2011studied case\u2011by\u2011case examples illustrate about the conditions under which sanctions work or fail?**  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  What counts as \u201cinfluence\u201d?\n\n| Conceptual definition | Typical operationalisation | Example of data source |\n|----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Policy compliance** | Target government makes a specific concession that matches the sanction\u2011issuer\u2019s stated demand (e.g., signing a treaty, abandoning a weapons program). | Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal., *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* (2007) \u2013 69 cases, 33\u202f% resulted in policy change. |\n| **Regime change** | Overthrow, resignation, or replacement of the ruling elite. | Peksen (2015) \u2013 1\u202f% of 208 cases led to regime change. |\n| **Behavioral moderation** | Target reduces the intensity of a hostile action without a formal concession (e.g., fewer rocket attacks, reduced trade in prohibited goods). | Drezner (2011) \u2013 \u201cpartial compliance\u201d in ~20\u202f% of cases. |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | Sanctions alter elite/public opinion, leading to internal debate or policy shifts. | Haggard & Kaufman (2016) \u2013 surveys of opposition parties in Iran, Venezuela. |\n| **Humanitarian impact** | Unintended civilian welfare losses (often used as a counter\u2011argument to \u201csuccess\u201d). | Galtung (1971); recent UN\u2011ODC and World Bank data on Iraq, Cuba. |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:**  Most scholars treat *policy compliance* (a concrete, observable concession) as the primary yardstick of \u201ceffectiveness.\u201d  Regime change is a secondary, much rarer outcome, and \u201cbehavioral moderation\u201d is a more ambiguous, often qualitative judgment.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

What policy change was demanded?\n\n| Demand | How it was expressed in sanction language |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **End of apartheid legislation** (i.e., repeal of the *Population Registration Act*, *Group Areas Act*, *Bantu Education Act*). | U.S. sanctions bill (1986) specifically linked removal of \u201cracial discrimination\u201d to the lifting of sanctions. |\n| **Release of political prisoners** (most famously Nelson\u202fMandela). | EC resolution 1987 called for \u201cthe immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners.\u201d |\n| **Negotiations for a democratic constitution**. | UN resolutions repeatedly urged \u201cthe establishment of a non\u2011racial, democratic system of government.\u201d |\n\nThe **sanction\u2011issuer\u2019s end\u2011state** was therefore *a negotiated political settlement that would dismantle the legal framework of racial segregation*.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
