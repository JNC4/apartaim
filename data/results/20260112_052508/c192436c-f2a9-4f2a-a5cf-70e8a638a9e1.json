      "unknown_model_response": "Below are some of the most commonly cited bacterial pathogens that can be present in un\u2011pasteurized (raw) milk, together with a brief description of the illnesses they can cause:\n\n| Pathogen | How it can end up in raw milk | Typical illness & symptoms | Why pasteurization matters |\n|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Escherichia coli O157:H7** (and other Shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing E.\u202fcoli) | Fecal contamination from the cow\u2019s udder, milking equipment, or the environment. | Severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and in some cases hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS), which can lead to kidney failure. | Heat treatment (\u226572\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) reliably kills E.\u202fcoli, eliminating the risk of HUS. |\n| **Salmonella spp.** | Contamination from the cow\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, dirty milking equipment, or cross\u2011contamination during handling. | Fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea that can last a week or more; invasive infections can spread to the bloodstream. | Pasteurization inactivates Salmonella, preventing these gastro\u2011intestinal infections. |\n| **Listeria monocytogenes** | Can survive in cooler temperatures and may be present in the farm environment; can contaminate milk if hygiene is poor. | Listeriosis, which may cause fever, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal symptoms; in pregnant women it can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe neonatal infection; in immunocompromised adults it can cause meningitis or septicemia. | Listeria is killed by standard pasteurization temperatures, dramatically reducing the risk of this serious infection. |\n| **Campylobacter jejuni** | Often originates from fecal contamination of the udder or equipment. | Diarrhea (often bloody), abdominal pain, fever, and sometimes Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a rare neurological complication). | Pasteurization eliminates Campylobacter, removing its associated diarrheal disease. |\n| **Staphylococcus aureus (enterotoxin\u2011producing strains)** |",
