      "unknown_model_response": "**Example Disease: Measles**\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects children. Before widespread vaccination, measles caused millions of cases worldwide each year, leading to serious complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis (brain inflammation), permanent hearing loss, and even death.\n\n**How the Measles Vaccine Works**\n\n1. **Live\u2011attenuated virus** \u2013 The measles component of the MMR (measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella) vaccine contains a weakened (attenuated) form of the measles virus. This virus is strong enough to stimulate the immune system but not strong enough to cause disease in healthy individuals.\n\n2. **Immune activation** \u2013 After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognizes the attenuated virus as foreign. It mounts a response that includes:\n   * Production of **neutralizing antibodies** that specifically target measles virus particles.\n   * Activation of **T\u2011cells** that help coordinate the immune response and provide long\u2011term memory.\n\n3. **Immunological memory** \u2013 The immune system \u201cremembers\u201d the measles virus. If a vaccinated child later encounters the wild\u2011type measles virus, those antibodies and memory T\u2011cells quickly recognize and neutralize it, preventing the virus from establishing an infection or causing severe disease.\n\n4. **Herd immunity** \u2013 When a high proportion of a community is vaccinated, measles transmission is dramatically reduced. This protects vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants too young for the vaccine or people with certain medical conditions).\n\n**Safety Profile**\n\nThe measles vaccine has been studied extensively in clinical trials and continues to be monitored through post\u2011licensure surveillance systems (e.g., VAERS in the United States, the Yellow Card Scheme in the UK). Key points about safety include:\n\n* **Common, mild side effects** \u2013 Soreness at the injection site, low\u2011grade fever, and a mild rash are the most frequently reported reactions. These typically resolve within a few days.\n* **Rare serious events** \u2013 Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) occur in about 1 per million doses. Extensive data show no credible link between the measles vaccine and chronic conditions such as autism or autoimmune disease.\n* **Risk\u2011benefit balance** \u2013 The risk of serious complications from measles infection far outweigh",
