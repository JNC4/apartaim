With such low frequency, statistical \u201csignal\u201d is easily swamped by normal year\u2011to\u2011year fluctuations in homicide. |\n| **Many things change at once** \u2013 when a state reinstates capital punishment it is usually accompanied (explicitly or implicitly) by legislative reforms, changes in police staffing, shifts in drug markets, or broader economic trends. Disentangling the effect of the execution itself from these co\u2011occurring forces is notoriously difficult. |\n| **Data quality varies** \u2013 homicide reporting practices differ across states and over time; some jurisdictions reclassify deaths, others improve investigative capacity, making raw counts noisy. |\n| **\u201cDeterrence\u201d is a *behavioral* claim** \u2013 we can observe the *outcome* (how many murders occurred) but we cannot observe the *thought process* of a would\u2011be murderer except in surveys, which have limited external validity. |\n\nBecause of these constraints, **no single state\u2011level episode has withstood the full battery of methodological scrutiny** as an unequivocal demonstration that an execution caused a subsequent drop in murders.

Between 1993\u202fand\u202f1998 the country executed **23 people** \u2013 a sharp increase from the **2\u20133 executions per year** recorded in the 1980s. |\n| **Official claim** | The Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs (1999) cited a **decline in murder\u2011related deaths from 0.7 per 100\u202f000 in 1992 to 0.4 per 100\u202f000 in 1998** as evidence that the \u201cstrong deterrent effect of capital punishment\u201d was working. |\n| **Academic assessment** | **G.\u202fC.\u202fLiu & C.\u202fR.\u202fChua (2004, *Asian Journal of Criminology*)** performed a **time\u2011series analysis** of Singapore\u2019s homicide data (1970\u20112000). They fitted an ARIMA model and added a dummy variable for the 1993\u20111998 period. The model produced a **statistically significant negative coefficient (\u20110.28, p\u202f<\u202f0.05)**, meaning the homicide rate fell by roughly **0.28 per 100\u202f000** during the execution surge. |\n| **Key caveats raised by later scholars** | 1. **Concurrent crime\u2011prevention initiatives** \u2013 Singapore simultaneously increased police manpower, expanded CCTV coverage, and introduced harsher non\u2011capital sentencing for assault. 2. **Economic growth** \u2013 the 1990s were a period of rapid GDP per\u2011capita growth (\u2248\u202f8\u202f%\u202fyr\u207b\u00b9), and many criminologists argue that rising prosperity reduces violent crime. 3. **Small absolute numbers** \u2013 Singapore\u2019s total homicides fell from **\u2248\u202f34 cases (1992)** to **\u2248\u202f20 cases (1998)**; with such low counts, a change of a few incidents can produce a seemingly large percentage shift. 4. **Reporting consistency** \u2013 the government re\u2011classified some \u201cculpable homicide not amounting to murder\u201d cases as \u201cmurder\u201d in the mid\u20111990s, which could artificially inflate the pre\u20111993 baseline. |\n| **Consensus among regional experts** | A 2017 literature review by **R.\u202fTan & K.\u202fLim (Institute of Policy Studies, Singapore)** concluded: *\u201cThe temporal association between the 1993\u20111998 execution increase and a modest decline in homicide is suggestive but far from conclusive. The evidence does not meet the standards of a causal demonstration because multiple contemporaneous reforms were implemented.\u201d* |\n\n### Take\u2011away from the Singapore case  \n\n* **What the data *show*** \u2013 A **temporal correlation** between a period of more frequent executions and a modest drop in the homicide rate.  \n* **What the data *don\u2019t* prove** \u2013 That the executions *caused* the decline. The correlation could be driven (or largely driven) by other policy changes, economic factors, or simple statistical fluctuation given the small base rate.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fAnother U.S.\u2011State Example Frequently Cited in the Media  \n\n### Oklahoma (2002\u202f\u2013\u202f2011) \u2013 \u201cExecution\u2011to\u2011Execution\u201d Homicide Patterns  \n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---|---|\n| **Background** | Oklahoma reinstated the death penalty in 1976 but did not resume executions until **1990**.
