Budgets cover advertising, staff overtime, transportation, storage, and the cash/ vouchers paid to participants. | Sufficient funding determines the scale of the event and the size of the incentive offered. |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fPublic outreach** | Multi\u2011channel campaign (press releases, radio spots, social\u2011media ads, flyers, community\u2011leader endorsements). Often includes \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d language and assurances that participants will not be prosecuted for possessing the weapon. | Maximises participation and reduces fear of legal repercussions. |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fIncentive structure** | **Cash** (e.g., US$100\u2013$500 per gun), **vouchers** (gift cards, store coupons), **donation\u2011to\u2011charity** options, or **non\u2011monetary rewards** (t\u2011shirts, community\u2011service credits). Some programs tier the amount by firearm type (hand\u2011gun > rifle > shotgun). | Incentives are the primary driver of voluntary surrender; their size correlates with the number of guns turned in. |\n| **5\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fCollection logistics** | \u2013 **Fixed\u2011site events** (police stations, community centers, schools).  <br>\u2013 **Mobile \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d units** that travel to neighborhoods.  <br>\u2013 **Mail\u2011in** or **drop\u2011box** options (rare, because of safety concerns).  <br>All guns are placed in secure containers, recorded, and later either destroyed (shredded, melted) or stored for evidence. | Logistics affect accessibility and perceived safety. Mobile units can reach high\u2011risk areas that lack transport. |\n| **6\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fScreening & data capture** | Staff may ask for a brief questionnaire (age, gun type, reason for surrender). Some jurisdictions record serial numbers, make/model, and whether the firearm was loaded. | Data help evaluate the program (e.g., proportion of high\u2011capacity rifles, proportion of older vs. newer guns). |\n| **7\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fDisposition** | Most programs **destroy** the firearms (metal\u2011cutting, melting). A few retain them for evidence or for donation to museums. | Destruction guarantees the weapons cannot re\u2011enter the market, a key goal of the policy. |\n| **8\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fFollow\u2011up & evaluation** | Post\u2011event",

What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is**  \n\n| Element | Typical practice (U.S. and other high\u2011income countries) | Variations that matter for outcomes |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Who can participate?** | Any legal gun owner who brings a firearm to an approved collection site. Some programs restrict to residents of a city/state, or to specific types of firearms (handguns, assault\u2011style rifles, etc.). | Mandatory \u201csurrender\u201d schemes (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 buy\u2011back) differ from purely voluntary programs. |\n| **What is offered as an incentive?** | Cash (often $50\u2011$250 per gun), vouchers, gift cards, or \u201cpoints\u201d redeemable for non\u2011cash items. In some jurisdictions the incentive is a \u201ctax credit\u201d rather than cash. | The size of the incentive influences turnout; higher payouts attract more guns but also raise cost per gun collected. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Fixed \u201cdrop\u2011off\u201d sites (police stations, community centers) or mobile \u201croad\u2011show\u201d units that travel to neighborhoods. Most programs require the gun to be unloaded and the owner to surrender any ammunition. | Mobile units can reach high\u2011risk neighborhoods that lack a nearby police station; fixed sites may be more convenient for suburban owners. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Turned over to law\u2011enforcement agencies, then either (a) destroyed (shredding, melting), (b) sold at auction to collectors, or (c) transferred to federal stockpiles. | Programs that destroy guns are often marketed as \u201cpublic\u2011safety\u201d buys; resale can generate revenue that offsets program costs, but may also raise concerns about re\u2011circulation. |\n| **Is the program a one\u2011off event or ongoing?** | Both exist. 1996 Australia and 1999 New Zealand were single, large\u2011scale events.  Many U.S. cities (e.g., Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia) run annual or semi\u2011annual \u201cvoluntary\u201d buy\u2011backs. | Repeated buy\u2011backs may affect long\u2011term gun\u2011ownership patterns differently than a single event. |\n| **How is the program advertised?** | Press releases, social\u2011media ads, flyers, community\u2011group outreach, radio/TV spots. Some programs partner with local churches, schools, or \u201cgun\u2011safety\u201d NGOs. | The reach and tone of outreach can affect who turns in guns (e.g., owners",

The 2009\u201110 decline continued that trajectory, but the **steeper slope** (\u201123\u202f% vs. an average \u20115\u202f% annual decline) is what the city highlighted. | The program **coincides** with an acceleration of an existing downward trend, but the trend alone does not prove the buy\u2011back caused the change. |\n| **Other concurrent interventions** | \u2022 2009: Expanded \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d outreach in high\u2011crime neighborhoods (the \u201cProject Safe Neighborhoods\u201d pilot). <br>\u2022 2009\u201110: Increased funding for street\u2011level violence\u2011interruption teams and a modest rise in police patrols. | These **co\u2011occurring programs** could have contributed to the observed decline; isolating the buy\u2011back effect is statistically difficult. |\n| **Statistical controls** | Rosenfeld & Smith (",
