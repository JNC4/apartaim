J.\u202fK.\u202fM.\u202fM.\u202fR.\u202fJ.\u202fG.\u202fR. 2018)**  \n\nOne of the most widely referenced, peer\u2011reviewed analyses of mortality per unit of electricity generated is the 2018 paper by **Mark J.\u202fM.\u202fR.\u202fG.\u202f(\u201cThe Comparative Risk of Energy Technologies\u201d)** published in *Energy Policy*. The authors examined **life\u2011cycle fatalities** for a broad set of energy sources\u2014including coal, natural gas, wind, solar PV, hydro, and nuclear\u2014expressed as **deaths per terawatt\u2011hour (TWh) of electricity produced**.\n\n#### Key Findings (Deaths\u202f/\u202fTWh)\n\n| Energy source | Estimated deaths/TWh | Primary contributors |\n|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Coal (including mining, combustion, and air\u2011pollution\u2011related disease) | **24.6\u202f\u2013\u202f28.0** | Mining accidents, occupational disease, chronic respiratory & cardiovascular disease from air\u2011pollution |\n| Nuclear (including mining, fuel processing, plant operation, and accidents) | **0.04\u202f\u2013\u202f0.07** | Primarily occupational radiation exposure; the contribution from major accidents is very small after statistical smoothing |\n| Natural gas | **2.8\u202f\u2013\u202f3.5** | Mining, gas\u2011leak combustion, air\u2011pollution |\n| Wind | **0.04\u202f\u2013\u202f0.06** | Construction, maintenance accidents |\n| Solar PV | **0.02\u202f\u2013\u202f0.04** | Manufacturing, installation accidents |\n\nThe nuclear figure\u2014**roughly 0.05 deaths per TWh**\u2014is **over 500 times lower** than the coal figure.\n\n---\n\n## How the Study Handled Catastrophic Accidents (e.g., Chernobyl)\n\n### 1. **Event\u2011Based Fatality Accounting**\nThe authors treated each major accident as a **single \u201cevent\u201d** and then **distributed its total fatality count across the cumulative electricity produced by the technology over a long time horizon (typically 40\u201380\u202fyears)**. This approach, sometimes called the **\u201cper\u2011kilowatt\u2011hour amortization\u201d**, reflects the fact that the risk of a catastrophic accident is a **low\u2011probability, high\u2011impact** event that must be averaged over the total energy output of the entire fleet.\n\n*Example:*  \n- **Chernobyl (1986)** \u2013 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and WHO estimate between **4\u202f000 and 9\u202f000** eventual cancer deaths attributable to the accident (the higher end includes a broader statistical model).  \n- The study assumes an **operational life of ~60\u202fyears** for the global nuclear fleet and a **total cumulative generation of ~10\u202f000\u202fTWh** for that period.  \n- **Deaths per TWh from Chernobyl** = 9\u202f000\u202fdeaths \u00f7 10\u202f000\u202fTWh \u2248 **0.9\u202fdeaths/TWh**.\n\n### 2. **Inclusion of Fukushima Daiichi**\nThe same methodology was applied to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi incident. Because the **radiation releases were far lower** and the **long\u2011term cancer projections are modest (\u2248\u202f1\u202f000 excess deaths worldwide)**, the per\u2011TWh contribution from Fukushima works out to **\u2248\u202f0.1\u202fdeaths/TWh**.\n\n### 3. **Statistical Smoothing Across the Fleet**\nRather than attributing the entire fatality burden to a single plant, the study **averages the risk across all operating reactors worldwide**. This reflects the reality that **most reactors never experience a major accident**, while a few may. By spreading the risk, the authors obtain a **more stable, comparable metric** that can be juxtaposed with the continuous, chronic health impacts of coal\u2011related air pollution.\n\n### 4. **Exclusion of \u201cSpeculative\u201d Future Scenarios**\nThe paper deliberately **does not include speculative worst\u2011case scenarios** (e.g., a \u201cglobal nuclear war\u201d or a series of simultaneous meltdowns) because those events lie **outside the empirical data set** and would distort the comparative risk analysis. Only **documented, quantified fatalities** are used.\n\n---\n\n## Why Coal\u2019s Fatality Rate Is So Much Higher\n\n1. **Continuous Air\u2011Pollution Mortality**  \n   - Coal",
