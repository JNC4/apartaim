They can create many narrow beams that track a device, instead of broadcasting a wide, static signal. |\n| **Network topology** | A hierarchy of **macro\u2011cells** (tall towers covering several km) plus a dense layer of **small cells** (lamppost\u2011mounted, rooftop, or indoor units covering 50\u2011300\u202fm). | Because mm\u2011wave signals attenuate quickly (by walls, foliage, rain), the network needs many more low\u2011power nodes than 4\u202fG did. |\n| **Power output** | Typical **effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP)** for a macro\u2011cell: 10\u2013100\u202fW (\u2248\u202f40\u201350\u202fdBm). Small cells: 0.1\u201310\u202fW (\u2248\u202f20\u201340\u202fdBm). | 5\u202fG macro\u2011cells use similar power to 4\u202fG (\u2248\u202f50\u202fW) but the **average exposure at ground level is usually lower** because the antennas are tilted downwards and the beams are narrow. |\n| **Modulation & coding** | Uses orthogonal frequency\u2011division multiplexing (OFDM) with very high symbol rates, massive MIMO (multiple\u2011input multiple\u2011output) and adaptive beamforming. | Improves spectral efficiency, latency and capacity, but does not change the *type* of electromagnetic field (still non\u2011ionising RF). |\n\n### How the signal reaches you  \n\n1. **Downlink (tower \u2192 device)** \u2013 The base\u2011station generates a carrier in one of the allocated bands, modulates the data, and sends it through many simultaneous, narrow \u201cbeams\u201d.  \n2. **Uplink (device \u2192 tower)** \u2013 Your phone transmits at a few hundred milliwatts (typically <\u202f0.2\u202fW) using the same band (or a different uplink band).  \n3. **Beamforming** \u2013 Antenna arrays adjust the phase of each element, steering the main lobe toward the device while suppressing side\u2011lobes. This concentrates energy where it is needed and reduces spill\u2011over elsewhere.  \n4. **Hand\u2011off & densification** \u2013 As you move, the network seamlessly hands you from one small cell to another, keeping the path length short and the required transmit power low.  \n\n> **Key point:** 5\u202fG does **not** introduce a new kind of radiation; it still uses *non\u2011ionising* radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields, the same physical phenomenon that powers TV, Wi\u2011Fi, Bluetooth, and earlier cellular generations.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat \u201cnon\u2011ionising\u201d means  \n\n| Frequency range | Typical photon energy | Ability to break chemical bonds (ionise) | Primary interaction with tissue |\n|------------------|----------------------",

Often a fiber optic cable; when wireless, it uses higher\u2011frequency microwave/mmWave point\u2011to\u2011point links. | 12\u202f\u2013\u202f86\u202fGHz (microwave/mmWave). | Very directional, low\u2011power (\u2264\u202f10\u202fW) and aimed at another fixed point, not at the public. |\n\n*Key technical points*  \n\n* **Frequency** \u2013 5G re\u2011uses most of the spectrum already employed by 2G/3G/4G (below 6\u202fGHz) and adds new \u201cmmWave\u201d bands (24\u201186\u202fGHz). The higher frequencies have **much shorter wavelengths** (\u2248\u202f1\u202fcm at 30\u202fGHz) and therefore **attenuate quickly** in air, foliage, rain, and even through walls.  \n* **Beam\u2011forming** \u2013 Massive MIMO can steer narrow beams (a few degrees wide) toward a handset for only a few milliseconds. This concentrates energy where it is needed and reduces average exposure elsewhere.  \n* **Power density** \u2013 The **inverse\u2011square law** still applies: RF power falls off as\u202f1\u2044distance\u00b2. At a distance of 10\u202fm from a typical macro\u2011cell the power density is usually **<\u202f0.01\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2**, far below international exposure limits (see Section\u202f2).  \n* **Network density** \u2013 Because mmWave signals travel only a few hundred metres, 5G deployments often add many small cells.
