      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of government bonds (and sometimes private\u2011sector securities) in order to lower long\u2011term interest rates, support credit markets and lift aggregate demand.**  \nBecause the channels through which QE works are not neutral, the policy can have very different consequences for households at opposite ends of the income\u2011and\u2011wealth distribution. Below is a structured review of the main mechanisms, the empirical evidence that has been gathered since the \u201cGreat\u2011Financial\u2011Crisis\u201d QE programmes (Fed, ECB, BOE, BOJ, SNB, etc.), and the points on which economists still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main transmission channels and why they matter for distribution\n\n| Channel | How it works | Who tends to benefit / bear the cost? |\n|---------|--------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **1.1 Lower long\u2011term interest rates** | QE pushes yields on Treasury and corporate bonds down, which reduces mortgage, auto\u2011loan, and other consumer\u2011credit rates. | \u2022 **Borrowers** (often younger, lower\u2011income households) get cheaper financing for homes, cars, education. <br>\u2022 **Savers** (typically older, higher\u2011net\u2011worth households) earn less on bank deposits and fixed\u2011income assets. |\n| **1.2 Asset\u2011price effects** | By raising the price of the securities it buys and by signalling a commitment to keep rates low, QE lifts stock prices, house prices, and the value of other risk assets. | \u2022 **Owners of equities, bonds, REITs, and housing** (over\u2011represented among the top 10\u201120\u202f% of wealth distribution) see large gains. <br>\u2022 **Non\u2011owners** (low\u2011income renters) receive little direct benefit. |\n| **1.3 Exchange\u2011rate depreciation** | Large\u2011scale purchases of domestic assets raise their price relative to foreign assets, often weakening the domestic currency. | \u2022 **Export\u2011oriented firms and workers** gain from higher foreign demand (potentially benefiting lower\u2011skill workers in manufacturing). <br>\u2022 **Import\u2011price\u2011sensitive households** (low\u2011income families spending a larger share of income on food, energy) may face higher prices if depreciation is modest or if import\u2011price pass\u2011through is strong. |\n| **1.4 Credit\u2011creation and \u201crisk\u2011taking\u201d channel** | By lowering funding costs for banks, QE can encourage banks to expand lending, especially to riskier borrowers. | \u2022 **Credit\u2011constrained households** (often low\u2011income) may obtain new loans, mortgages or small\u2011business credit. <br>\u2022 **Risk\u2011taking** can also inflate asset bubbles that later hurt the same households when they burst. |\n| **1.5 Inflation expectations** | QE can raise expected inflation, which may erode the real value of fixed nominal incomes (e.g., Social Security, wages that are sticky). | \u2022 **Low\u2011income earners** whose wages are less indexed to inflation may lose purchasing power. <br>\u2022 **Debtors** (including many low\u2011income households) may benefit if nominal interest rates stay low while inflation rises. |\n| **1.6 Fiscal\u2011spillover effects** | QE reduces the government\u2019s debt\u2011service cost, potentially freeing fiscal space. Whether that space is used for redistribution depends on political choices. | \u2022 If the fiscal expansion targets **low\u2011income groups** (e.g., expanded unemployment benefits, stimulus checks), QE indirectly benefits them. <br>\u2022 If the fiscal space is used for **tax cuts for high earners** or debt\u2011repayment, the distributional impact is neutral or regressive. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2.1 Asset\u2011price channel \u2013 the strongest and most consistent finding\n\n| Study | Method | Key result | Distributional implication |\n|-------|--------|------------|----------------------------|\n| **Bernanke, Gertler & Gilchrist (1999); Bernanke (2005)** (early QE theory) | Macro\u2011model simulations | QE raises asset prices substantially, especially equities and housing",

The price rise continues after QE ended, but the steepest upward slope coincides with the QE periods (especially QE1\u2011QE3).  \n\n**Why the price jump?**  \n\n| Mechanism | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Lower mortgage rates** \u2013 The Fed\u2019s purchases of agency MBS directly pushed yields on those securities down, which translated into cheaper mortgage financing. Empirical studies (e.g., *Kuttner 2012; Gagnon, Ranciere, Sack, & Swanson 2011*) estimate that each 100\u2011basis\u2011point cut in the 10\u2011year Treasury lowered the 30\u2011year mortgage rate by about 30\u201140\u202fbps, expanding mortgage credit. | |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect on demand** \u2013 Lower rates raised the present value of expected future home\u2011price appreciation, encouraging both owner\u2011occupiers and investors to purchase. *Campbell & Cocco (2007)* show that a 1\u202f% decline in mortgage rates raises the probability of home\u2011ownership by ~2\u202fpercentage points. | |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** \u2013 By buying safe, low\u2011yielding Treasuries, the Fed forced investors into riskier assets, notably equities and real estate. *Borio, Gambacorta & Hofmann (2017)* quantify that roughly 30\u201140\u202f% of the QE\u2011induced rise in U.S. house prices came from this channel. | |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate depreciation** \u2013 QE contributed to a modest weakening of the dollar, raising import prices of building materials and, paradoxically, also boosting demand for U.S. housing from foreign buyers. | |\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Rent growth outpaced inflation** | \u2022 National median rent rose from **\u2248\u202f$800/month (2008 Q4)** to **\u2248\u202f$1,050/month (2014 Q4)** \u2013 a **+31\u202f%** increase. <br>\u2022 CPI\u2011inflation over the same period was only **+12\u202f%**. | Rent is a larger share of a low\u2011income household\u2019s budget (\u2248\u202f30\u201140\u202f% for families earning <\u202f$30\u202fk). A faster\u2011than\u2011inflation rise squeezes disposable income. | *National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) 2015 report* \u2013 \u201cRent burden\u201d for households earning \u2264\u202f30\u202f% of area median income rose from **45\u202f% to 52\u202f%** nationally. |\n| **2. Supply\u2011side pressure: \u201cBuy\u2011to\u2011let\u201d incentives** | \u2022 QE lowered mortgage rates, making it cheap for investors (including institutional REITs and private equity) to finance new rental properties. <br>\u2022 The share of **\u201cinstitutional rentals\u201d** (owned by large investors) grew from **\u2248\u202f12\u202f% (2008)** to **\u2248\u202f18\u202f% (2014)** of the total rental stock. | More investor\u2011owned units can mean higher rents because profit\u2011maximising landlords set rents at market rates rather than \u201caffordable\u2011to\u2011income\u201d levels. However, the extra supply can also offset some price pressure if construction keeps pace. | *Joint Center for Housing Studies, Harvard (2016)* \u2013 a 1\u202f% decline in the 30\u2011yr mortgage rate increased the number of newly built rental units by **0.3\u202f%**, but the effect was concentrated in higher\u2011income neighborhoods. |\n| **3. Housing\u2011cost\u2011to\u2011income ratio for renters** | \u2022 Ratio **(median rent \u00f7 median household income)** rose from **0.28 (2008)** to **0.34 (2014)** for the bottom\u2011quintile. <br>\u2022 For the bottom\u201120\u202f% it climbed from **0.33 to 0.41**. | Higher ratios mean a larger fraction of income must be spent on shelter, leaving less for food, health, transportation, and savings \u2192 higher risk of material hardship. | *Brookings Institution, \u201cHousing Affordability and the Great Recession\u201d (2015)* \u2013 a 10\u2011percentage\u2011point rise in the rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio raises the probability of \u201crent\u2011burdened\u201d status by **\u2248\u202f7\u202fpp** for low\u2011income households. |\n| **4. Credit\u2011access for renters** | \u2022 The **Federal Reserve\u2019s Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)** data show that the share of **new mortgage loans to first\u2011time, low\u2011income borrowers** fell from **14\u202f% (2008)** to **9\u202f% (2014)**. <br>\u2022 At the same time, **subprime auto\u2011loan** originations rose, indicating a shift of credit toward other consumer goods. | Fewer low\u2011income families could convert rent into ownership, reinforcing a \u201crenter trap\u201d. Even though mortgage rates were low, tighter underwriting after the crisis limited eligibility. | *Federal Reserve, \u201cCredit Conditions Survey\u201d (2014)* \u2013 \u201cCredit\u2011worthy\u201d low\u2011income households reported a **30\u202f% decline** in perceived access to mortgage credit relative to 2008. |\n| **5.
