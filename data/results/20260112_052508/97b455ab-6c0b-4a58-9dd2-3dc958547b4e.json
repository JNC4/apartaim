Small, sometimes non\u2011significant elevations for pancreatic and prostate cancers. | Whether the risk is driven mainly by cooking method (high\u2011temperature grilling), heme\u2011iron, or other meat constituents; magnitude of risk for non\u2011colorectal cancers. |\n| **Overall cancer burden** | In 2020 the WHO estimated that *\u2248\u202f0.5\u202f%* of all global cancer deaths (\u2248\u202f130\u202f000 deaths) could be attributed to processed\u2011meat consumption; for unprocessed red meat the figure is \u2248\u202f0.2\u202f%. | Absolute risk increase is modest for most individuals (e.g., an extra 1\u20132 cases of colorectal cancer per 10\u202f000 people eating 100\u202fg/day for 20\u202fyears). | How risk interacts with genetics, gut microbiome, and overall dietary pattern. |\n| **Nutritional trade\u2011offs** | Red meat supplies high\u2011quality protein, iron, zinc, vitamin\u202fB12, and other micronutrients important especially for certain life stages (e.g., pregnancy, adolescence, older adults). | The nutrients can be obtained from other foods, but the convenience and bioavailability of meat are high. | Whether modest reductions in meat intake (or switching to \u201clean\u201d cuts) preserve nutritional benefits while lowering cancer risk. |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into the evidence, the reasoning behind the classifications, the points of contention, and practical implications.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Positive associations also observed for stomach cancer, but evidence weaker. |\n| **Unprocessed red meat** \u2013 *2015* | **Group\u202f2A** (probably carcinogenic) | Same pool of studies, but fewer mechanistic data specific to unprocessed meat | Limited evidence for colorectal cancer; the classification reflects **probable** rather than **definite** causality. |\n\n*Why the difference?* Processed meat contains added **nitrites/nitrates**, which can form **N\u2011nitroso compounds (NOCs)**\u2014known carcinogens\u2014during cooking or digestion. Unprocessed meat lacks these additives, so the evidence relies more on indirect mechanisms (e.g., heme iron, cooking\u2011induced heterocyclic amines).\n\n### 1.2.
