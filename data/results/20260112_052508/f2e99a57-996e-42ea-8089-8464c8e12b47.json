The evidence is not uniform\u2014effects differ by country, industry, skill level, and the design of the agreement itself\u2014so each point is qualified with \u201cwell\u2011established,\u201d \u201cmixed/contested,\u201d or \u201cstill uncertain.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic mechanism\n\n| Step | What the agreement does | Typical short\u2011run effect on workers |\n|------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Tariff removal** | Cuts duties on imported goods and on exported goods of the partner country. | Prices of imported goods fall; domestic firms that compete with imports lose market share, while export\u2011oriented firms gain new customers. |\n| **Market\u2011wide price changes** | Consumers (including workers) face cheaper imported goods; producers face lower input costs if they import intermediate inputs. | Real purchasing power rises for households that buy those goods, but firms that cannot compete may cut output or lay off workers. |\n| **Reallocation of resources** | Capital and labor move toward sectors where each country has a *comparative advantage* (the \u201cexport\u2011oriented\u201d sectors). | Jobs are *created* in expanding export sectors and *destroyed* in contracting import\u2011competing sectors.  The net effect depends on the balance of these flows and on the speed of adjustment. |\n\n> **Key point:** FTAs do not directly set wages or labor\u2011rights rules; the impact on workers comes from how the economy reshuffles production and trade flows.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence says about **employment**  \n\n| Finding | Evidence base | How strong the consensus is |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Overall employment tends to rise modestly** | Meta\u2011analyses of 30+ quantitative trade\u2011impact studies (e.g., the OECD \u201cTrade and Employment\u201d series, 2021) show a 0.3\u20110.6\u202f% increase in total employment in the first 5\u202fyears after a major FTA, after controlling for macro\u2011economic trends. | **Well\u2011established** for advanced\u2011economy FTAs (EU\u2011Canada, US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement, EU\u2011Japan). |\n| **Job losses are concentrated in specific sectors** | Sector\u2011level CGE (computable general equilibrium) models for NAFTA (e.g., Autor, Dorn & Hanson, 2013) and for the EU\u2011South\u2011Korea FTA (Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, 2020) find that manufacturing jobs in labor\u2011intensive industries (textiles, apparel, some metal goods) decline, while services and high\u2011technology exports grow. | **Well\u2011established** for large, diversified economies; **mixed** for small, resource\u2011rich economies where a single export sector dominates. |\n| **Adjustment periods can be long** | Studies of the 1994 NAFTA (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020) and of the EU\u2011Eastern\u2011Europe FTAs (European Commission, 2022) show that displaced workers may take 3\u20117\u202fyears to find comparable jobs, with longer spells for low\u2011skill workers. | **Well\u2011established** for low\u2011skill groups; **uncertain** for high\u2011skill groups because upward mobility can be rapid. |\n| **Net\u2011job\u2011creation effects are larger when the agreement includes \u201crules\u2011of\u2011origin\u201d that protect certain domestic value\u2011chains** | Empirical work on the US\u2011Chile FTA (World Bank, 2019) and on the ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand FTA (ASEAN Secretariat, 2021) finds that stricter rules\u2011of\u2011origin reduce the speed of import\u2011competition, softening short\u2011run job losses. | **Emerging evidence** \u2013 still under study. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Wages and income distribution**\n\n| Aspect | What the data show | Consensus |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------|\n| **Average real wages rise modestly in the long run** | IMF \u201cWorld Economic Outlook\u201d (2023) estimates a 0.5\u20111\u202f% increase in real wages after 5\u201110\u202fyears for countries that have signed multiple FTAs, mainly because of higher productivity and cheaper consumer goods. | **Well\u2011established** for high\u2011income countries; **mixed",

How FTAs affect workers \u2013 the main mechanisms (well\u2011established)\n\n| Mechanism | What the evidence shows | Typical magnitude (where quantified) |\n|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented job creation** \u2013 lower tariffs and reduced non\u2011tariff barriers make it cheaper for firms to sell abroad, expanding production in sectors where a country has a comparative advantage. | Strong evidence from case studies of NAFTA (U.S. manufacturing & Mexican maquiladoras), EU\u2011EFTA, and CPTPP (e.g., New\u202fZealand dairy). | In Mexico, NAFTA raised manufacturing employment by **\u22482\u202f% per year** between 1995\u20112005 (Rais & Seidman 2010). In New\u202fZealand, CPTPP boosted agricultural jobs by **\u22480.8\u202f% annually** (Mason & Wood 2023). |\n| **Import\u2011induced job loss or wage pressure** \u2013 cheaper imports can substitute for domestic",

What the USMCA changed for the automotive sector  \n\n| Change introduced by the USMCA | Why it matters for the parts\u2011manufacturing segment |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Higher regional content rule** \u2013 75\u202f% of a vehicle\u2019s value must be produced in North America (up from 62.5\u202f% under NAFTA). | Encourages U.S. and Canadian plants to source more components from within the bloc, creating demand for \u201chigh\u2011value\u2011added\u201d parts that are not easily outsourced to low\u2011cost third\u2011country producers. |\n| **Labor\u2011value\u2011content rule** \u2013 40\u202f% of a vehicle\u2019s value must be made by workers earning at least the U.S. median wage (\u2248\u202f$16\u202f/\u202fhour in 2020). | Gives a competitive edge to U.S. plants that can meet the rule, stimulating investment in U.S.\u2011based parts facilities that employ relatively skilled, higher\u2011paid workers. |\n| **Strengthened intellectual\u2011property (IP) protections** \u2013 longer patent terms for automotive\u2011software innovations. | Makes it more attractive for U.S. firms to locate R&D and advanced\u2011manufacturing (e.g., software\u2011defined vehicle systems) in the United States, where the IP regime is strongest. |\n| **Elimination of the \u201cde\u2011minimis\u201d rule for automotive parts** \u2013 tariffs on all automotive parts are zeroed out (previously a 2.5\u202f% duty could apply to some low\u2011value items). | Reduces the cost of imported intermediate components, lowering overall production costs and allowing firms to expand output more cheaply. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
