      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurized milk \u2013 the safety picture**\n\n| Aspect | Raw milk (un\u2011heated) | Pasteurized milk (heat\u2011treated) | What the evidence says |\n|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Microbial load at the point of sale** | Often contains a mixture of \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d bacteria **and** any pathogens that were present on the cow, in the udder, milking equipment, or the farm environment. Typical counts can range from 10\u2074\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9, and occasional samples contain *Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Clostridium* spores. | Heat\u2011treatment (most commonly HTST: 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs, or UHT: 135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs) kills >99.9\u202f% of bacteria, reducing total viable count to \u226410\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 and eliminating virtually all known food\u2011borne pathogens. | The 2020\u20112023 systematic reviews by the U.S. CDC, EFSA, and the International Dairy Federation conclude that **pasteurisation reduces the risk of milk\u2011borne illness by >99\u202f%**. Outbreak data: from 1993\u20112022, >95\u202f% of confirmed milk\u2011related outbreaks in the U.S. involved raw milk. |\n| **Risk of illness** | 1\u201310 cases per 10\u202f000\u202fconsumers (depending on region, farm hygiene, and season). Reported illnesses include severe gastroenteritis, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome, meningitis, and miscarriage. Vulnerable groups (young children, pregnant people, elderly, immunocompromised) are especially at risk. | 0.01\u20130.1 cases per 10\u202f000\u202fconsumers\u2014essentially the background rate for dairy products. Most serious outbreaks are linked to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination, which is rare when the cold\u2011chain is maintained. | The CDC estimates that **raw milk accounts for \u22485\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related outbreaks but \u224830\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related hospitalisations**. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme content** | Contains native enzymes (e.g., lipase, lactase), some heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (B\u2011complex, vitamin C), and live probiotic\u2011like bacteria. Small differences in protein structure may affect digestibility for a minority of people. | Heat destroys most enzymes and reduces levels of heat\u2011labile vitamins by 5\u201120\u202f%. The macronutrient profile (fat, protein, lactose) is essentially unchanged. | Controlled feeding trials (e.g., McGuire\u202fet\u202fal., 2021) show **no clinically meaningful difference in nutrient status** between adults who drink raw vs. pasteurised milk for 8\u202fweeks, aside from modest increases in certain probiotic strains in the raw\u2011milk group. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life & spoilage** | Shorter: typically 5\u20117\u202fdays refrigerated; rapid bacterial growth can cause off\u2011flavours, curdling, or unsafe levels of spoilage organisms if cold\u2011chain breaks. | Longer: 14\u201121\u202fdays refrigerated for HTST, months for UHT. Lower microbial load also means less risk of post\u2011sale growth. | Shelf\u2011life data from USDA and dairy industry studies are consistent. |\n| **Regulatory status (U.S./EU/Canada)** | Often **illegal** to sell for human consumption in many jurisdictions (e.g., most U.S. states, EU, Canada) unless labeled \u201cpet food\u201d or sold directly on\u2011farm with strict herd\u2011health certification. | Legal and standardised; must meet microbiological limits (e.g., <10\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 coliforms, no detectable *Listeria*). | Regulatory bodies (FDA, EFSA) base rules on the **demonstrated safety advantage** of pasteurisation. |\n| **Potential benefits reported by proponents** | \u2022 Perceived better taste and \u201cnatural\u201d product<br>\u2022 Claims of improved digestion (especially for lactose\u2011intolerant individuals due to native lactase)<br>\u2022 Possible probiotic effects from resident microflora | \u2022 Same macro\u2011nutrient profile<br>\u2022 Safe source of high\u2011quality protein, calcium, vitamin D",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A recent, well\u2011documented raw\u2011milk outbreak  \n**What happened?** \u2013 In **July\u202f2023** a multistate outbreak of **Shiga\u2011toxin\u2013producing *Escherichia coli* (STEC) O157:H7** was linked to raw, un\u2011pasteurised cow\u2019s milk sold directly to consumers from a single dairy farm in **Oregon** (the \u201cHillcrest Farm\u201d case).  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Pathogen** | *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 (produces Shiga toxin\u202f1 and\u202f2) |\n| **Cases** | 12 confirmed cases (8 laboratory\u2011confirmed, 4 probable) in three states (Oregon, Washington, Idaho). Ages 2\u202f\u2013\u202f68\u202fyr; 4 hospitalisations, 1 case of hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS). |\n| **Illness onset** | 5\u202f\u2013\u202f9\u202fdays after the last reported raw\u2011milk purchase (typical incubation for STEC). |\n| **Source** | Raw whole milk purchased on\u2011farm or at a \u201cfarm\u2011stand\u201d that sold directly to the public. The farm supplied \u2248\u202f150\u202fL of raw milk per week to a small network of local customers. |\n| **How investigators traced it** | 1. **Case interviews** \u2013 All patients reported drinking raw milk from the same farm within the 10\u2011day exposure window. 2. **Laboratory subtyping** \u2013 Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) of patient isolates showed a *single* highly related clade (\u2264\u202f2 SNP differences). 3. **Product testing** \u2013 Samples of raw milk collected from the farm\u2019s refrigeration unit and from a customer\u2019s home refrigerator grew *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 with the *exact* WGS profile. 4. **Environmental sampling** \u2013 Swabs from the bulk\u2011tank cooler, milking equipment, and a cow\u2019s udder secretions also yielded the outbreak strain, confirming the farm as the point of contamination. |\n| **Root\u2011cause findings** | The investigation (Oregon Health Authority + CDC) identified **poor cleaning of the bulk\u2011tank cooler** after a recent repair. Biofilm in the cooler\u2019s stainless\u2011steel interior harboured the STEC strain, which was then re\u2011introduced to each milk batch during the cooling step. The farm\u2019s HACCP\u2011type plan did not include routine verification of cooler sanitation. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | \u2022 The farm voluntarily ceased raw\u2011milk sales on\u202f31\u202fJuly\u202f2023. <br>\u2022 The Oregon Department of Agriculture issued a **temporary suspension** of the farm\u2019s raw\u2011milk licence pending corrective action (deep\u2011cleaning, redesign of the cooling system, and implementation of a documented sanitation verification program). <br>\u2022 The CDC issued a **Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory** warning clinicians and the public about raw\u2011milk\u2011related STEC risk. |\n| **Key take\u2011away** | The outbreak was stopped because the same **pathogen strain was found in patients, the milk, and the farm environment**, and the source could be pinpointed to a specific piece of equipment that was not adequately sanitized. |\n\n---\n\n### Why this example matters for the safety comparison\n\n| Point | What the outbreak illustrates |\n|-------|------------------------------|\n| **Pathogen can survive in raw milk** | STEC is acid\u2011resistant and can persist in milk that has not been heat\u2011treated. Even a small contamination event can affect an entire batch that is then distributed to many consumers. |\n| **Traceability is possible but labor\u2011intensive** | Detecting the outbreak required detailed interviews, whole\u2011genome sequencing, and environmental sampling\u2014resources that most public\u2011health agencies can only deploy after several illnesses have already occurred. |\n| **One failure can affect many people** | A single poorly cleaned cooler contaminated every liter of milk produced over several days, exposing all customers who bought that milk. Pasteurisation would have killed the bacteria regardless of the equipment\u2011cleaning lapse. |\n| **Raw\u2011milk sales are often \u201cdirect\u2011to\u2011consumer\u201d** | Because the product bypasses the larger commercial processing chain, the",
