Penetration into deeper tissues is less than for lower\u2011frequency bands. |\n| **Beamforming / massive MIMO** | Antennas with many elements can steer narrow beams toward a device rather than broadcasting omnidirectionally. | The instantaneous power density in the direction of the beam can be higher than a traditional sector antenna, but the beam spends only a fraction of a second on any given spot, and the average exposure over time remains low. |\n| **Small\u2011cell densification** | More cells placed closer together to compensate for the limited range of mmWave. | Each individual transmitter operates at lower power because the distance to the user is short. The overall \u201cambient\u201d RF level in a dense urban area is the sum of many low\u2011power sources. |\n| **Time\u2011division duplex (TDD)** | Uplink and downlink share the same frequency band, alternating in time. | Users\u2019 devices also transmit, contributing a small amount of RF exposure (typically <\u202f0.1\u202fW). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHow Exposure is Quantified  \n\n| Metric | Definition | Typical regulatory limit (general public) |\n|--------|------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Power density (S)** | Energy per unit area (W/m\u00b2). Relevant for frequencies\u202f\u2265\u202f6\u202fGHz where the wavelength is small compared to the body. | 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (ICNIRP, FCC) for frequencies 2\u2013300\u202fGHz. |\n| **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)** | Rate at which RF energy is absorbed per unit mass of tissue (W/kg). Used for frequencies\u202f\u2264\u202f6\u202fGHz where the field penetrates deeper. | 2\u202fW/kg (averaged over 10\u202fg of tissue) in the US; 4\u202fW/kg (averaged over 10\u202fg) in Europe. |\n| **Reference levels for whole\u2011body exposure** | 0.08\u202fW/kg (ICNIRP) for the whole body, based on thermal effects. | Same as above. |\n\n*",

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.\u202fWhat \u201cBeam\u2011Steering\u201d Means in a 5\u202fG Small Cell  \n\n| Concept | How it is realized in hardware | What it does to the radiated field |\n|---------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Phased\u2011array antenna** | An array of many (typically 8\u201164) identical radiating elements, each fed by a separate RF channel. The signal to each element is given a precise **phase shift** (and sometimes a small amplitude tweak). | When the phases are chosen correctly, the individual wavelets add constructively in one direction and destructively elsewhere. The result is a **narrow, high\u2011gain beam** that can be pointed anywhere inside the array\u2019s field\u2011of\u2011view (usually a few tens of degrees in azimuth and elevation). |\n| **Digital beam\u2011forming** | The phase\u2011shift values are generated in a digital signal\u2011processor (DSP) or FPGA and updated every few hundred microseconds to a few milliseconds. | The beam can **track a moving user device** (smartphone, tablet, vehicle) with a latency of <\u202f10\u202fms, keeping the user inside the high\u2011gain main lobe while the rest of the surrounding space sees only the much lower sidelobe level. |\n| **Multi\u2011user MIMO (MU\u2011MIMO)** | The same array can create **separate beams** for several users at the same time, each beam having its own set of phase\u2011shift values (the DSP solves a linear\u2011algebra problem called \u201cprecoding\u201d). | The total radiated power is **shared** among the active beams, so the power density of any *single* beam is lower than it would be if the whole EIRP were dumped into one direction. |\n| **Dynamic power control** | The base\u2011band software continuously monitors the radio link quality (signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio, error rate, etc.). If the link is strong, it reduces the transmit power; if the link degrades, it raises the power just enough to maintain the target data rate. | The **instantaneous EIRP** can vary from a few milliwatts up to the maximum rated value (e.g., 1\u202fW) but, on average, it stays well below the maximum because most users are only a few meters away and the channel is good. |\n\n### Visual picture\n\n```\n            \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n            \u2502 5G Base\u2011band    \u2502\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                  \u2502     \u2502\n          (digital)   (RF)  \u2192  Phased\u2011array panel (\u2248 30\u202fcm \u00d7 30\u202fcm)\n                  \u2502\n            \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n            \u2502  Beam\u2011forming DSP  \u2502\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                  \u2502   (updates phase set\u2011points every 0.5\u20112\u202fms)\n   \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\n  Narrow high\u2011gain beam (\u2248 10\u00b0\u201115\u00b0 width) sweeps across users\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhy Beam\u2011Steering Does **Not** Increase Average Exposure  \n\n### 2.1.\u202fTwo \u201ctime\u2011averaging\u201d steps are built into the exposure calculation  \n\n| Step | What is averaged | Typical averaging interval used by safety guidelines |\n|------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **(a) Beam\u2011on time for a *given point* on the ground** | The beam may point at that point for a few milliseconds while a user passes by, then it points elsewhere. | The **ICNIRP/FCC** reference level for power density is defined for **continuous exposure** (i.e., a *steady\u2011state* value).
