      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurised milk \u2013 the safety picture**\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the safety\u2011related differences that have been documented in peer\u2011reviewed research, government reports, and major health\u2011organisation statements.  Each point notes how certain aspects are **well\u2011established** (high\u2011quality, reproducible data) and which aspects remain **debated or uncertain** (limited data, conflicting findings, or ongoing research).\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cpasteurisation\u201d actually does  \n\n| Process | Typical conditions | Primary purpose |\n|---------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | Kill most vegetative bacteria, preserve flavor |\n| **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs | Standard in most supermarkets; kills most pathogens |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fs | Extends shelf\u2011life (months) but can change taste and some heat\u2011sensitive nutrients |\n\n**Result:**  The heat denatures proteins and disrupts the cell membranes of *most* bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause food\u2011borne illness.  The process is **validated** by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) as an effective means of reducing microbiological risk.  \n\n*Well\u2011established:*  Pasteurisation reduces the total bacterial load by **\u22655 log\u2081\u2080** (i.e., >99.999\u202f% reduction) and eliminates the most common pathogens (see Section\u202f2).  \n\n*Debated:*  Some argue that certain \u201cbeneficial\u201d microbes and enzymes are also destroyed, potentially affecting gut health or flavor.  The scientific consensus is that any such benefits are **not proven to outweigh the infection risk** (see Section\u202f4).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

At 63\u201172\u202f\u00b0C most bacterial membranes become fluid and \u201cleaky,\u201d proteins unfold, and nucleic\u2011acid\u2011binding enzymes lose activity. |\n| **Time** | Duration of exposure at the target temperature | See above | The longer the exposure, the more cumulative damage.  A 5\u2011log\u2081\u2080 reduction (99.999\u202f% kill) of *Salmonella* in milk at 72\u202f\u00b0C is achieved in **\u224812\u202fs**; the industry adds a safety margin (15\u202fs) to guarantee the target. |\n| **Heat\u2011transfer medium** | Milk itself is a good conductor; agitation and rapid cooling are part of the process | Continuous\u2011flow plate heat exchangers (HTST) or batch vats (LTLT) with vigorous stirring | Uniform temperature eliminates \u201ccold spots\u201d where bacteria could survive. |\n| **Cooling** | Rapidly bring the product below the \u201cdanger zone\u201d (4\u201160\u202f\u00b0C) | Ice\u2011water bath (LTLT) or plate\u2011chiller (HTST) | Stops any residual thermal injury from becoming reversible.  Quick cooling also prevents post\u2011process growth of any survivors. |\n\n### 2. What the heat does at the cellular level  \n\n| Structural/functional target | Effect of 63\u201172\u202f\u00b0C for the typical exposure times | Why this stops disease |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Cell membrane (phospholipid bilayer)** | Lipid molecules become more fluid; phase transition leads to loss of integrity \u2192 leakage of cytoplasmic contents. | The cell can no longer maintain its internal environment \u2192 death. |\n| **Membrane proteins & transporters** | Denature (unfold) and aggregate; pumps stop working. | No active transport of nutrients or removal of toxic metabolites \u2192 metabolic collapse. |\n| **Cytoplasmic enzymes (e.g., DNA polymerase, ribosomal proteins)** | Heat\u2011induced unfolding, loss of active sites, irreversible aggregation. | Protein synthesis and DNA replication stop; the cell cannot repair damage or divide. |\n| **Ribosomes** | Disassembly of the 70S bacterial ribosome into subunits; loss of translation capacity. | No new proteins can be made, including virulence factors (e.g., Shiga toxin). |\n| **DNA** | Direct breakage is minimal at pasteurisation temperatures, but **heat\u2011induced DNA\u2011binding protein denaturation** prevents proper replication/repair. | Even if a cell were somehow still alive, it could not replicate its genome. |\n| **Spore coat (for *Bacillus* spp.)** | Spores are highly resistant; standard pasteurisation does **not** inactivate them. | This is why pasteurisation is not marketed as a \u201cspore\u2011kill\u201d step.  However, the spore\u2011forming bacteria that are most relevant to milk safety (*Bacillus cereus*) are rarely a cause of the severe, systemic illnesses (HUS, listeriosis) that dominate raw\u2011milk outbreak statistics. |\n\n**Result:** The overwhelming majority of **vegetative (actively growing) bacterial cells**\u2014including the pathogens most often implicated in raw\u2011milk outbreaks\u2014are killed.  The process is calibrated to achieve at least a **5\u2011log\u2081\u2080 reduction** (i.e., 99.999\u202f% kill) of the *most heat\u2011resistant* target organism, which for milk is *Coxiella burnetii* (the agent of Q\u2011fever).
