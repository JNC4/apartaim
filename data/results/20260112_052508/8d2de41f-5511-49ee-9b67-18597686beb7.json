      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) in a nutshell**\n\nQE is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large quantities of financial assets\u2014usually government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities\u2014with newly created reserves.  The goal is to lower long\u2011term interest rates, support credit\u2011market functioning, and stimulate aggregate demand when the policy\u2011rate is already near zero.\n\nBecause QE works through the financial system, its effects are felt unevenly across different groups in the economy.  Below is a synthesis of the most robust empirical findings, the main theoretical arguments, and the points where scholars and practitioners still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The transmission chain\n\n| Step | What happens | Primary channels that matter for distribution |\n|------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Asset purchases** | Central bank buys bonds \u2192 price of bonds rises \u2192 yields fall. | Lower yields on safe assets (government bonds, Treasuries, sovereign bonds). |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Investors sell the bonds they just sold to the central bank and buy other assets (e.g., corporate bonds, equities, housing). | Raises prices of riskier assets, compresses corporate borrowing costs. |\n| **Expectations & signaling** | QE signals that the central bank will keep policy accommodative for a while. | Reduces risk premia, anchors low\u2011inflation expectations, encourages borrowing. |\n| **Liquidity & credit supply** | Banks receive excess reserves; they can lend more cheaply, but only if willing and if borrowers meet credit standards. | Improves financing conditions for firms and households with good credit; limited impact on credit\u2011constrained agents. |\n| **Wealth and \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d** | Higher asset prices increase the net worth of owners of those assets. | Household consumption can rise if people feel richer; the effect is strongest for owners of equities, bonds, and real estate. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** (in open economies) | Lower yields make domestic currency less attractive \u2192 depreciation. | Export\u2011oriented firms gain a price advantage; import\u2011competing households face higher import prices. |\n| **Inflation expectations** | Persistent QE can eventually raise expected inflation. | Real balances (cash, low\u2011yield bonds) lose value, hurting savers; borrowers benefit if nominal rates stay low. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Households\n\n### 2.1 Who benefits?\n\n| Group | Mechanism | Typical empirical evidence |\n|-------|-----------|----------------------------|\n| **Home\u2011owners (especially those with mortgages)** | Lower long\u2011term rates \u2192 cheaper mortgage refinancing; house\u2011price appreciation (especially in markets where QE directly bought mortgage\u2011backed securities). | U.S. studies (e.g., Mian & Sufi 2020) find a 10\u2011basis\u2011point fall in 10\u2011yr Treasury yields raised mortgage refinancing activity by 2\u20113\u202f% and reduced average mortgage rates by \u22480.3\u202f%. |\n| **Equity\u2011owners** | Portfolio\u2011rebalancing lifts stock prices; higher dividend yields and capital gains. | In the Euro\u2011area, the ECB\u2019s QE (2015\u201119) was linked to a 5\u201110\u202f% increase in the MSCI Europe index (Borio & Gambacorta 2020). |\n| **High\u2011income, high\u2011net\u2011worth households** | Own a larger share of financial assets that appreciate the most (stocks, high\u2011yield bonds, real estate). | Distributional studies (e.g., Bivens, 2021, \u201cThe Distributional Effects of QE\u201d)",

Why QE pushes stock prices up\n\n| Mechanism | What the research finds |\n|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** \u2013 central banks buy safe bonds \u2192 yields fall \u2192 investors look for higher yields \u2192 buy equities. | 1\u202fbp fall in the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield \u2248 0.6\u202fbp rise in the S&P\u202f500 dividend yield (Borio & Gambacorta 2020). |\n| **Lower discount rates** \u2013 the present value of future corporate cash flows is discounted at a lower risk\u2011free rate plus a (roughly constant) risk premium. | A 15\u2011bp drop in the 10\u2011yr Treasury reduces the discount factor for a 10\u2011year cash flow by about 2\u202f% (simple approximation). |\n| **Improved corporate financing conditions** \u2013 cheaper long\u2011term borrowing lets firms invest and expand, raising future earnings. | Studies of the Fed\u2019s QE2 (2010\u201112) estimate a 0.3\u202f%\u20110.5\u202f% increase in the \u201cequity risk premium\u201d per $100\u202fbn of QE, but the net effect on prices is still positive (Gagnon et al. 2011). |\n| **Expectations channel** \u2013 QE signals that the central bank will keep policy accommodative, which lowers the \u201cexpected future short\u2011rate\u201d and therefore the term\u2011structure. | Survey\u2011based expectations show a 0.25\u202f% decline in the expected 5\u2011year rate after each $500\u202fbn of QE (Kuttner 2018). |\n\nAll of the above means that **the aggregate equity market typically rises by roughly 5\u201112\u202f% over the life of a large QE program**, after controlling for macro\u2011economic fundamentals.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
