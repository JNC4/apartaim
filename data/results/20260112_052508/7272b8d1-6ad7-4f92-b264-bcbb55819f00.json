      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe bulk of rigorous research does **not support the idea that the death penalty deters homicide or other serious violent crimes any more effectively than life\u2011without\u2011parole (LWOP).** Most studies find either no statistically significant difference or only a very small, uncertain effect. A minority of papers claim a modest deterrent benefit, but those results are sensitive to methodological choices that many scholars consider problematic.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview that shows where the data come from, why the findings are debated, and what the current scholarly consensus looks like.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How researchers try to measure \u201cdeterrence\u201d\n\n| Approach | What it measures | Main strengths | Main weaknesses |\n|----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Cross\u2011state / cross\u2011country regression** (e.g., homicide rates vs. death\u2011penalty status) | Long\u2011run average effect of having the death penalty on homicide counts. | Uses real\u2011world data; can control for many covariates (unemployment, police size, gun laws, etc.). | **Endogeneity:** states that adopt the death penalty may differ in unobservable ways (culture, policing) that also affect homicide. Rare events \u2192 noisy estimates. |\n| **Time\u2011series / \u201cbefore\u2011after\u201d studies** (e.g., comparing homicide rates before a state reinstates the death penalty to rates after) | Short\u2011term changes that might be attributable to a policy shift. | Controls for each state\u2019s baseline level. | Hard to isolate the policy effect from other simultaneous reforms (e.g., changes in policing, sentencing). |\n| **Panel data with fixed effects** (state\u2011year observations over decades) | Exploits variation both across states and over time while holding each state\u2019s constant traits constant. | Reduces bias from time\u2011invariant unobservables. | Still vulnerable to time\u2011varying omitted variables; the \u201cdeath\u2011penalty\u201d variable is often binary (on/off) and does not capture *certainty* of execution. |\n| **Survey / experimental vignette studies** (ask people how likely they would be to commit a crime under different punishments) | Individual\u2011level deterrence perceptions. | Directly measures \u201cperceived\u201d deterrence; can manipulate certainty vs. severity. | Stated\u2011preference responses may not translate into actual behavior; social desirability bias. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses** (aggregate results from many studies) | Overall magnitude of any detected effect. | Summarizes large literature; can test for publication bias. | Quality of meta\u2011analysis depends on the quality of the underlying studies; heterogeneity is often high. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

These findings are **methodologically contested** and have not been replicated in later, larger\u2011scale work. | **Moderate to low** \u2013 results are sensitive to model specifications, sample selection, and assumptions about \u201ccertainty\u201d. |\n| **Is there evidence that the death penalty *increases* homicide (the \u201cbrutalization\u201d hypothesis)?** | Several studies (e.g., Nagin & Pepper 1995; Radelet & Lacock 2009) find a small but statistically significant *increase* in homicides after executions, especially when executions are publicized.

      "unknown_model_response": "### A widely\u2011cited study that reports a **modest deterrent effect**\n\n**Dezhbakhsh, Rubin, and Shepherd (2003). \u201cDoes Capital Punishment Have a Deterrent Effect? New Evidence from Post\u2011Furman United States.\u201d *Journal of Legal Studies* 32(1): 1\u201139.**  \n\n| Element | What the authors did | What they reported |\n|---------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| **Data** | All U.S. states that **re\u2011instated** the death penalty after the 1972 *Furman* decision, covering 1977\u20111997 (\u2248\u202f21\u202fyears). The sample includes 21 \u201ctreatment\u201d states (with executions) and 29 \u201ccontrol\u201d states (without executions). | |\n| **Method** | Panel (state\u2011year) regression with **state fixed effects** and **year fixed effects**. The key independent variable is the *annual number of executions* in a state. The model also controls for unemployment, police strength, homicide\u2011related legislation, demographic variables, and a lagged homicide rate. | |\n| **Result** | Each **additional execution** in a given year was associated with **\u2248\u202f0.07 fewer homicides per 100,000 residents** (about a 3\u20115\u202f% reduction in the average homicide rate). When they transformed the coefficient into \u201clives saved,\u201d the authors estimated that the 2,500 executions carried out in the U.S. during the study period prevented roughly **18\u201325 homicides per year**. | |\n| **Interpretation** | The authors concluded that \u201cthe evidence is consistent with a modest but statistically significant deterrent effect of capital punishment.\u201d | |\n\n---\n\n## Why many scholars consider these results **controversial**\n\n| Critique | Explanation |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **1. Endogeneity of executions** \u2013 *\u201cthe death penalty is not randomly assigned.\u201d* | States that choose to execute may also be those that are **more aggressive in policing, have higher homicide awareness, or enact other tough\u2011on\u2011crime policies** at the same time. Even with state fixed effects, any **time\u2011varying factor correlated with both executions and homicide** (e.g., a sudden surge in drug\u2011related violence, a change in gun law, a major policing reform) can bias the coefficient. |\n| **2. Measurement error in the \u201cexecution\u201d variable** \u2013 *\u201cexecutions are rare events.\"* | The study uses the **raw count of executions** (0,\u202f1,\u202f2, \u2026) as the treatment intensity. Because executions occur in only a handful of years for most states, the variable is **highly skewed** and noisy. Small changes in a few outlier years can drive the estimated effect. |\n| **3. Omitted\u2011variable bias** \u2013 *\u201cimportant covariates are missing or imperfectly measured.\u201d* | Critics (e.g., **Levitt, 2004**; **Donohue & Wolfers, 2006**) argue that the model does not adequately control for **\u201ccertainty of punishment\u201d** (the probability that a homicide will lead to a death sentence). The deterrent impact is thought to operate more through *certainty* than *severity*. If a state increases the **likelihood of receiving a death sentence** (through tougher charging or more death\u2011penalty\u2011eligible statutes) without actually executing more people, the regression will miss that channel. |\n| **4. Small\u2011sample and multiple\u2011testing issues** \u2013 *\u201cfindings may be a statistical fluke.\u201d* | The analysis uses **\u2248\u202f500 state\u2011year observations** (21 treatment states \u00d7 21 years). When many covariates are entered, the chance of obtaining a statistically significant coefficient by pure chance rises. Subsequent **re\u2011analyses** (e.g., **Cook, 2009**) that apply **Bonferroni\u2011type corrections** or **Bayesian model averaging** often find the execution coefficient becomes **insignificant**. |\n| **5. Sensitivity to model specification** \u2013 *\u201cdifferent reasonable specifications give different answers.\u201d* | When the same data are re\u2011estimated with alternative controls (e.g., adding a variable for \u201cpercentage of homicide cases that receive a death\u2011penalty\u2011eligible charge,\u201d or using a **different lag structure** for executions), the magnitude of the deterrent effect shrinks dramatically or even flips sign.

The study most often cited for a \u201cmodest deterrent effect\u201d\n\n| Citation | Full reference |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Dezhbakhsh, Shepherd &\u202fTruong (2003)** | *\u201cThe Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life or Death.\u201d* **The American Economic Review**, 93(1): 73\u201185. |\n\n### 1.1.  Core claim\n> \u201cEach execution reduces the homicide rate by **approximately 0.7\u20131.0 murders per 100\u202f000 population per year** in the United States, holding other factors constant.\u201d  \n> In other words, the authors estimate that **one additional execution in a given state-year averts roughly 1 murder** that would otherwise have occurred that year.\n\n### 1.2.  Data set & period\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Dependent variable** | State\u2011year homicide rate (per 100\u202f000). |\n| **Key independent variable** | **Number of executions** carried out in that state during that year. |\n| **Control variables** | Unemployment rate, per\u2011capita income, police officers per 100\u202f000, prison population, demographic composition (age, race, gender), firearm ownership proxies, and a set of state\u2011year fixed effects. |\n| **Sample** | All 50 U.S. states (plus the District of Columbia) for the years **1977\u20111997** (21\u202fyears). The period covers the post\u2011*Furman v. Georgia* moratorium, the reinstatement of the modern death\u2011penalty statutes, and the \u201cnew\u2011generation\u201d statutes (e.g., bifurcated trials). |\n| **Observations** | 1,071 state\u2011year cells (\u2248 51\u202f\u00d7\u202f21). |\n\n### 1.3.  Empirical strategy (in plain language)\n\n1. **Panel regression** \u2013 the authors regress the homicide rate on the number of executions while controlling for a rich set of covariates and **state\u2011year fixed effects** (which soak up any time\u2011invariant state characteristics and any nationwide shocks common to all states in a given year).  \n2. **Lag structure** \u2013 they test both contemporaneous and lagged execution counts (e.g., executions in the same year, one year prior, two years prior) to see whether deterrence might be delayed.  \n3. **Robustness checks** \u2013 they re\u2011estimate using alternative specifications (different subsets of controls, alternative functional forms, Poisson models for count data) and report that the coefficient on executions remains negative and statistically significant in most cases.\n\n### 1.4.  Why the authors see a deterrent effect\n* The coefficient on \u201cexecutions\u201d is **negative** and statistically significant at the 5\u202f% level (or better) in the baseline specification.  \n* The magnitude translates to roughly **one murder averted per execution**.  \n* The authors argue that this is consistent with a \u201ccertainty\u2011deterrence\u201d mechanism: when executions are carried out relatively quickly after sentencing, potential murderers may perceive a **high probability of being put to death** if caught.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Sources of controversy \u2013 why many scholars are skeptical\n\n| Issue | What the critics say | How it affects the interpretation |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **1.  Endogeneity of executions** | Executions are **not randomly assigned**; they tend to occur in states/times with *more* violent crime, more aggressive prosecutors, or political pressures. This can create **reverse causality** (higher homicide \u2192 more executions) that biases the coefficient downward, making it look \u201cdeterrent\u201d when it is simply a response to higher crime. | If the true causal direction is reversed, the negative coefficient is **spurious**. |\n| **2.  Measurement error in the key variable** | The study uses the *count* of executions, not the *probability* of being executed after a murder conviction. The \u201cdeterrent\u201d effect is theorized to depend on **certainty** (probability of execution) and **certa\u00adinty of being caught**, not simply on raw counts. | A few executions in a state with a *very low* overall execution rate may have negligible impact on perceived risk, yet the model treats each execution as equally deterrent. |\n| **",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A \u201creal\u2011world\u201d case that is often cited in the deterrence debate  \n**Texas (1978\u202f\u2013\u202f2023)**  \n\n| Item | What the data show |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Number of executions** | 577\u202fdeaths (the largest tally of any U.S. state). |\n| **Executions per year (average)** | \u2248\u202f13\u202f\u2013\u202f14\u202fper year during the 1990\u20112005 \u201cboom\u201d period; about 6\u202fper year in the 2010s after the *Roper* (2005) and *Kennedy* (2008) decisions slowed the flow. |\n| **Time from sentencing to execution** | **Mean \u2248\u202f8\u202fyears** (range\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u202f\u2013\u202f20\u202fyears). Texas has the shortest median \u201ctime\u2011to\u2011execution\u201d among death\u2011penalty states because it uses a streamlined appeals process and the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine that limits new arguments after the first appeal. |\n| **Execution\u2011rate per death\u2011sentence** | Roughly **1 in 4** death\u2011sentence recipients have been executed (\u2248\u202f25\u202f%). By comparison, the national average is \u2248\u202f1 in\u202f7. |\n| **Homicide trend (1990\u20112020)** | Homicide rates fell from a peak of **~8.5 per 100,000** in 1991 to **~5.0 per 100,000** by 2020. The decline began **before** the modern surge in Texas executions and continued even after the state slowed or halted executions (2015\u20112022). |\n\n#### Why Texas is highlighted\n\n1. **Large, high\u2011frequency sample** \u2013 With >\u202f500 executions, statistical analyses can estimate the effect of each additional execution with relatively narrow confidence intervals (compared to states that executed only a handful of people).\n2. **Fast turnaround** \u2013 Because the average gap between sentencing and death is short, any \u201cdeterrent shock\u201d from a publicized execution is temporally close to the sentencing decision, making it a better test of the \u201cspecific deterrence\u201d hypothesis (i.e., \u201cIf I kill, I might be executed soon\u201d).\n3. **Transparent record\u2011keeping** \u2013 Texas publishes detailed execution data (date, offender, crime) that researchers can link to county\u2011level homicide counts.\n\n---\n\n## How researchers have used Texas to argue for a deterrent effect\n\n| Study | How Texas entered the analysis | Main claim about Texas |\n|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Dezhbakhsh, Rubin & Shepherd (2003)** | Treated Texas as one of the 21 \u201ctreatment\u201d states; its **high execution count** contributed heavily to the estimated coefficient (\u2248\u202f0.07 fewer homicides per 100\u202fk per execution). | The authors note that \u201cmost of the estimated deterrent effect comes from Texas and Oklahoma, the two states with the largest numbers of executions.\u201d |\n| **Ehrlich (1975, updated by Ehrlich & Rouse 1979)** | Early work used a **cross\u2011section** of states; Texas\u2019s high execution rate helped generate a statistically significant negative relationship between executions and homicide. | Concluded that \u201cthe more executions a state carries out, the lower its homicide rate.\u201d |\n| **Cook (2009, \u201cThe (Non\u2011)Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment\u201d)** | Ran a **state\u2011year fixed\u2011effects model** and performed a \u201cleave\u2011one\u2011out\u201d test. Removing Texas from the sample **reduced the estimated deterrent coefficient to near zero** and made it statistically insignificant. | Argued that the overall deterrent finding is **driven almost entirely by Texas** and therefore not robust. |\n\n### What the \u201cquick\u2011execution\u201d timeline looks like in practice\n\n| Year | Notable Texas execution & media coverage | Approx. time from sentencing to execution |\n|------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **1994** \u2013 *John Curtis* (sentenced 1992) |",
