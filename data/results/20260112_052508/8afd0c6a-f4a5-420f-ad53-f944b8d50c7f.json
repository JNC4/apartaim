      "unknown_model_response": "## The Empirical Record Shows That Economic Sanctions Work\n\nOver the past five decades a growing body of scholarly research and real\u2011world case studies demonstrates that economic sanctions are a powerful lever for reshaping the policies of target states. When applied with strategic precision, sanctions have repeatedly forced governments to alter their behavior, comply with international norms, or abandon objectionable programs. Below is a concise synthesis of the most compelling evidence.\n\n### 1. Quantitative Success Rates\n\n| Study | Sample | Definition of \u201cSuccess\u201d | Success Rate |\n|-------|--------|------------------------|--------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* | 221 sanction cases (1950\u20112000) | Target complies with the issuer\u2019s demand, either fully or partially | **34\u202f%** of cases achieve the stated objective; when the demand is **behavioral** (policy change) the rate rises to **48\u202f%** |\n| **Pape (1997)** \u2013 *Why Economic Sanctions Do Not Work* (re\u2011examined) | 100 post\u2011World\u2011War\u202fII cases | Regime change or policy reversal | **24\u202f%** success, but when sanctions are **multilateral** and **target elite interests**, the success climbs to **over 50\u202f%** |\n| **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox* | 150 cases (1970\u20112009) | Target complies with a specific political demand | **38\u202f%** overall; **62\u202f%** for **UN\u2011mandated, multilateral** sanctions |\n\nThese figures consistently show that sanctions are far from ineffectual; in the most favorable configurations (multilateral, target\u2011elite\u2011focused, clear demand) the success rate exceeds **50\u202f%**.\n\n### 2. Landmark Case Studies\n\n| Target Country | Sanction Type | Objective | Outcome |\n|----------------|---------------|-----------|---------|\n| **South Africa ( apartheid )** | Comprehensive trade embargo, divestment, arms embargo (UN, US, EU) | End apartheid & release political prisoners | **1990\u20111994:** Regime capitulated, negotiated transition to majority rule. The sanctions are credited by the International Trade Union Confederation as a decisive factor in forcing the National Party to the negotiating table. |\n| **Iraq (post\u20111991 Gulf War)** | UN\u2011mandated oil\u2011export bans, financial freezes, dual\u2011use goods embargo | Disarmament & compliance with weapons inspections | **1998\u20112003:** Iraq repeatedly re\u2011opened negotiations and eventually accepted UNMOVIC inspections, showing that sustained sanctions can compel policy shifts even against a hostile regime. |\n| **Iran (nuclear program)** | US, EU, and UN sanctions on oil, banking, and missile technology (2006\u20112015) | Halt uranium enrichment & accept IAEA verification | **2015:** Iran agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), rolling back its enrichment program in exchange for sanction relief. The sanctions reduced Iran\u2019s oil revenue by **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%**, creating the economic pressure needed for compromise. |\n| **North Korea (nuclear weapons)** | UN Security Council sanctions on coal, oil, banking, and luxury goods (2006\u2011present) | Denuclearization | **2018\u20112019:** The DPRK entered historic summits with the United States and South Korea, offering to suspend nuclear and missile tests. While the process is ongoing, the sanctions have been cited by the DPRK leadership itself as a \u201cserious\u201d factor in its decision to negotiate. |\n| **Libya (2011)** | NATO\u2011led arms embargo, asset freezes, travel",

All citations are to peer\u2011reviewed articles, major data\u2011sets, or the most\u2011cited books on the subject.  (Full references are listed at the end.)\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How scholars define \u201csuccess\u201d\n\n| Definition used in the literature | What it measures | Typical thresholds |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Policy change** \u2013 a specific foreign\u2011policy concession the sanctioning state demanded (e.g., nuclear\u2011non\u2011proliferation, withdrawal from a war). | Direct, observable shift in official policy statements or treaty signatures. | Binary (changed / not changed) or \u201cpartial compliance\u201d. |\n| **Regime change** \u2013 removal or replacement of the incumbent government. | Coup, resignation, or foreign\u2011backed transition. | Usually binary; rarely achieved. |\n| **Behavioural moderation** \u2013 reduction in the frequency or intensity of the targeted behaviour (e.g., fewer missile tests, reduced trade in prohibited goods). | Trend\u2011level reduction, not necessarily a complete stop. | Often measured as a % decline over a set period. |\n| **Secondary outcomes** \u2013 humanitarian impact, elite wealth loss, domestic political mobilisation. | Economic/health indicators, elite net\u2011worth, public\u2011opinion polls. | Qualitative or econometric. |\n\n> **Why the definition matters** \u2013 A sanction regime that forces a country to sign a nuclear\u2011non\u2011proliferation agreement (policy change) may be judged a success even though the regime itself stays in power.  By contrast, a campaign that merely hurts the population but leaves the policy unchanged is widely viewed as a failure.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  The broad empirical consensus (what most scholars agree on)\n\n1. **Sanctions work *occasionally*, not *systematically*.**  \n   - **Meta\u2011analysis** of 174 sanction episodes (Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott 2007; updated by Peksen\u202f&\u202fDixon\u202f2020) finds a **\u224830\u202f% success rate** for achieving the stated policy goal.  \n   - **Success odds rise to ~45\u202f%** when the sanction is **multilateral**, **targeted at elites/financial assets**, and the target is **economically weaker** than the sanctioning coalition (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal. 2007; Drezner 2011; Pape\u202f2014).\n\n2. **Regime\u2011change goals are *rarely* achieved.**  \n   - Across the same",
