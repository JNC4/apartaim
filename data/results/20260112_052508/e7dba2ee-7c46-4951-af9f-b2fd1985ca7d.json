What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Element | Typical practice | Variations that matter |\n|---------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Voluntary vs. mandatory** | Most programs are *voluntary*: owners bring a gun to a designated site and receive a cash or voucher payment. | *Mandatory surrender* (often called a \u201cgun\u2011amnesty\u201d) forces owners to turn in prohibited weapons under penalty\u2011free conditions. The two are sometimes lumped together, but the incentives and legal context differ. |\n| **Who can participate?** | \u2022 All legal owners (sometimes limited to specific types of firearms).<br>\u2022 In some U.S. city programs, only unregistered or \u201cunwanted\u201d guns are accepted; in Australia, any privately\u2011owned firearm could be turned in. | \u2022 \u201cHigh\u2011risk\u201d buybacks target owners with restraining orders, domestic\u2011violence convictions, or mental\u2011health flags. <br>\u2022 \u201cCommunity\u201d buybacks focus on neighborhoods with high gun\u2011violence rates. |\n| **Incentive offered** | Cash (often $50\u2013$500 per gun) or store vouchers. The amount can vary by caliber, type, or condition. | Some programs use *tiered* payments (higher for rifles, lower for pistols) to shape the composition of surrendered guns. |\n| **Logistics** | \u2022 A single \u201cevent\u201d (e.g., a weekend at a police station) or a series of pop\u2011up sites. <br>\u2022 Certified firearms\u2011safety officers or law\u2011enforcement personnel receive the guns, record serial numbers, and destroy them (usually by shredding or melting). | \u2022 Mobile \u201cdrive\u2011through\u201d units that travel to schools, churches, or festivals.<br>\u2022 Partnerships with NGOs, retailers, or community groups that run the event on behalf of police. |\n| **Data collection** | Most U.S. city programs keep a count of guns turned in, sometimes the make/model, and the payment amount. | Some jurisdictions (e.g., Australia, Canada) also record the *origin* (e.g., personal collection, heirloom) and link the data to existing firearm registries. |\n| **Funding** | Municipal or state budgets, federal grants (e.g., U.S. DOJ\u2019s \u201cCommunity Oriented Policing Services\u201d), or private foundations. | In Australia, the 1996 buyback was financed by a temporary tax on high\u2011income earners; in New Zealand, a $12\u202fmillion \u201cfirearms amnesty\u201d fund was set aside. |\n\n### The basic workflow\n\n1. **Announcement & outreach** \u2013 Police or a sponsoring agency publicizes the date, location, and payment schedule (often with flyers, social\u2011media ads, and community\u2011leader briefings).  \n2. **Drop\u2011off** \u2013 Participants bring firearms (and sometimes ammunition) to the site.

Australia \u2013 1996 National Firearms Buy\u2011Back\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Policy** | After the Port Arthur massacre (April\u202f1996) the federal government passed the **National Firearms Agreement (NFA)**.  The NFA mandated a **mandatory, nationwide buy\u2011back** of all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and pump\u2011action shotguns.  The government raised a **temporary 0.5\u202f% tax on high\u2011income earners** and collected **\u2248\u202fAU$1\u202fbillion** to purchase and destroy **~\u202f650\u202f000 firearms** (\u2248\u202f1.5\u202f% of all civilian guns). |\n| **Time frame** | Buy\u2011back ran from **Oct\u202f1996 to Dec\u202f1997** (\u2248\u202f14\u202fmonths). |\n| **Outcome measures** | \u2022 **Firearm homicide rate** (per 100\u202f000 population).<br>\u2022 **Firearm suicide rate**.<br>\u2022 **Non\u2011fatal firearm injuries** (hospital data). |\n| **Results (national level)** | \u2022 **Homicides:** 30\u202f% drop in firearm homicide rate from 1995 to 1999 (from 0.93 to 0.65 per 100\u202fk).  The overall homicide rate (all weapons) fell only 6\u202f% in the same period, suggesting the firearm\u2011specific effect.  <br>\u2022 **Suicides:** 13\u202f% decline in firearm\u2011related suicide rate (from 5.1 to 4.4 per 100\u202fk).  <br>\u2022 **Non\u2011fatal injuries:** 28\u202f% decline in hospital admissions for firearm injuries (1995\u20112000). |\n| **Key citations** | \u2022 Chapman, S., Alpers, P., Agho, K., & Jones, M. (2006). *Australia\u2019s 1996 gun law reforms: Faster falls in firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and a decade without mass shootings.* **Injury Prevention**, 12(6), 365\u2011367.  <br>\u2022 McPhedran, S., & Pridmore, S. (2005). *The impact of the Australian National Firearms Agreement on firearm homicide, suicide and accidental death.* **Australian & New Zealand Journal of Criminology**, 38(1), 1\u201120. |\n| **Methodological strengths** | \u2022 **Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS)** with several pre\u2011 and post\u2011points (1990\u20112005).<br>\u2022 Nationwide data, so no \u201cselection bias\u201d from a single city.<br>\u2022 Simultaneous legal changes (licensing, background checks) were **controlled for** in multivariate ITS models. |\n| **Limitations / debate** | \u2022 The NFA also introduced **stricter licensing, uniform storage standards, and a 10\u2011day waiting period**; disentangling the buy\u2011back from those measures is challenging.<br>\u2022 Some scholars argue the **decline began before the buy\u2011back** (e.g., a modest downward trend in the early\u20111990s).<br>\u2022 The **absolute number of guns removed** (\u2248\u202f1.5\u202f% of the civilian stock) seems small relative to the observed decline, leading to speculation that the policy\u2019s *symbolic* effect (deterrence, \u201cnorm\u2011setting\u201d) mattered as much as the physical removal. |\n| **Bottom line** | The Australian experience is the **only national\u2011scale, mandatory buy\u2011back** with a clear, sustained reduction in firearm homicide and suicide rates that persisted for a decade after the program.  While multiple legislative components were introduced together, most quantitative evaluations attribute **a statistically significant portion of the drop to the removal of a large, highly lethal subset of guns**. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
