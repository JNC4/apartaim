      "unknown_model_response": "**Gun\u2011Buyback Programs \u2013 How They Work**\n\n| Element | Typical practice | Variations / notes |\n|---------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Funding** | Usually municipal, state or federal budget allocations; sometimes private foundations or NGOs. | Some cities charge a small \u201cadministrative fee\u201d to participants, but most programs are free to the gun owner. |\n| **Eligibility / Scope** | Voluntary surrender of firearms by private owners. Often limited to hand\u2011guns, but some programs also accept rifles, shotguns, and \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d weapons. | A few jurisdictions have *mandatory* surrender components (e.g., New\u202fZealand\u2019s post\u2011Christchurch 2020 program) that required owners to turn in certain categories of guns, but most buy\u2011backs remain voluntary. |\n| **Anonymity** | Participants typically give no identifying information; they receive a voucher/cash gift (often $50\u2011$200) for each firearm turned in. | In some places (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 buy\u2011back) the surrender was *not* anonymous because the government needed serial\u2011number records for destruction and for compensation. |\n| **Logistics** | \u2013 **Site**: police stations, community centers, schools, or mobile vans.<br>\u2013 **Process**: gun is inspected, rendered inoperable (e.g., de\u2011activated, shredded, melted).<br>\u2013 **Compensation**: cash, gift cards, or vouchers given on the spot. | Some programs pair the buy\u2011back with safety\u2011education events, free training, or distribution of lock\u2011boxes. |\n| **Legal framework** | Usually authorized by a city ordinance, state law, or a temporary emergency order. The law may specify which firearms are eligible, the maximum number per person, and how the money is paid. | In the U.S., buying back guns is not a federal requirement; it is a local policy choice. In other countries the program can be part of a larger gun\u2011control reform (e.g., Australia\u2019s National Firearms Agreement). |\n| **Data collection** | Organizers often keep counts of guns collected, type, caliber, and sometimes a rough estimate of the firearm\u2019s age. | Because anonymity is prized, demographic data on owners (age, gender, prior criminal record) are rarely captured, limiting evaluation. |\n\n---\n\n## What the Evidence Says About Their Impact on Gun\u2011Related Violence\n\n### 1.  What the **most rigorous** studies have measured\n\n| Outcome | Typical metric | Representative findings (with citation) |\n|---------|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Volume & type of firearms removed** | Number of guns, proportion that are *loaded* or *functional* | \u2022 Australia (1996):\u202f~650\u202f000 firearms collected (\u2248\u202f1.5\u202f% of estimated civilian stock). 85\u202f% were hand\u2011guns; ~\u202f17\u202f% were semi\u2011automatic rifles.  <br>\u2022 U.S. city buy\u2011backs (e.g., Seattle 2015, Boston 2017): 1\u202f500\u20132\u202f500 guns each, >\u202f70\u202f% hand\u2011guns; most were older, low\u2011capacity models. |\n| **Firearm homicide** | Homicides per 100\u202f000 population, often compared to pre\u2011program trend | \u2022 Australian 1996 buy\u2011back + accompanying legislation: firearm homicide fell from 1.04 to 0.27 per 100\u202f000 (\u2248\u202f74\u202f% drop) over the next decade; the drop was larger than the pre\u2011program trend (Chapman\u202fet\u202fal., 2006).  <br>\u2022 U.S. city\u2011level studies: most find *no statistically significant* change in homicide rates after a single voluntary buy\u2011back (e.g., Koper\u202f&\u202fMoynihan, 2009; Vizzard, 2014). |\n| **Firearm suicide** | Suicide deaths per 100\u202f000; proportion using a firearm | \u2022 Australia",
