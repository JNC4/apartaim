Molecular characterisation** | \u2022 Identify the inserted gene(s) and the DNA sequence that surrounds them.<br>\u2022 Verify where the DNA lands in the plant genome and whether any unintended changes (e.g., extra copies, rearrangements) occurred. | Shows exactly what new genetic material is present and helps predict any new proteins that could be made. |\n| **2. Protein expression & structure** | \u2022 Measure how much of the new protein(s) the plant produces.<br>\u2022 Determine the protein\u2019s amino\u2011acid sequence, three\u2011dimensional shape, and stability (e.g., heat\u2011denaturation). | Allows comparison with known toxins or allergens and informs the dose to be used in toxicology tests. |\n| **3. Compositional analysis** | \u2022 Compare the GMO with a non\u2011GMO near\u2011isogenic counterpart for key nutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals) and for anti\u2011nutrients (e.g., lectins, phytates).<br>\u2022 Look for unexpected metabolites using untargeted metabolomics. | Confirms that the GMO is substantially equivalent in its overall nutrition and that no harmful compounds have been unintentionally created. |\n| **4. Allergenicity assessment** | \u2022 Search the new protein\u2019s sequence for similarity to known allergens.<br>\u2022 Test stability to digestion (pepsin resistance) and heat.<br>\u2022 In some cases, perform serum\u2011IgE binding studies with blood from allergic individuals. | Most food allergens are proteins that survive digestion and are resistant to heat; similarity suggests a potential risk that can be investigated further. |\n| **5. Toxicology testing** | \u2022 **Acute toxicity** \u2013 high\u2011dose single\u2011day feeding in rodents to look for immediate adverse effects.<br>\u2022 **Sub\u2011chronic (90\u2011day) feeding** \u2013 rodents receive the GMO as a major part of their diet; endpoints include body weight, organ weights, blood chemistry, histopathology.<br>\u2022 **Chronic/carcinogenicity** \u2013 only required if the new protein has a plausible mechanism of long\u2011term harm; otherwise the 90\u2011day study plus a thorough literature review are considered sufficient. | Directly measures whether the food causes physiological harm at or above realistic consumption levels. |\n| **6. Nutritional impact** | \u2022 If the GMO is intended to change nutrient content (e.g., \u201cGolden Rice\u201d with \u03b2\u2011carotene), the intended benefit is quantified.<br>\u2022 For \u201csubstantial equivalence\u201d cases, the nutrient profile is compared to the conventional counterpart. | Ensures the GMO does not create a deficiency or excess of any nutrient. |\n| **7. Environmental & agronomic assessment** | \u2022 Examine potential for gene flow to wild relatives, development of resistance in pests, or impacts on non\u2011target organisms.<br>\u2022 While not a direct human\u2011health test, environmental effects can indirectly affect food safety (e.g., via new herbicide residues). | Required by many regulators to guarantee that the cultivation system does not introduce new hazards. |\n| **8. Regulatory review & public consultation** | \u2022 All data are compiled into a **dossier** submitted to the relevant authority (e.g., U.S. FDA, EFSA in Europe, Health Canada, APVMA in Australia).<br>\u2022 Independent scientific panels evaluate the dossier against pre\u2011established guidelines (FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius, OECD consensus documents).<br>\u2022 Some jurisdictions also invite public comment. | Provides a transparent, peer\u2011review\u2011style checkpoint before market approval. |\n| **9. Post\u2011market monitoring** (optional but increasingly common) | \u2022 Surveillance for unexpected adverse events (e.g., allergen reports, changes in consumption patterns).<br>\u2022 Periodic re\u2011assessment if new scientific data emerge. | Captures rare or long\u2011latency effects that pre\u2011clinical studies might miss. |\n\n---\n\n### What the scientific community has concluded\n\n* **Consensus** \u2013 Major scientific bodies (World Health Organization, FAO, National",

It carries a gene from the soil bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) that makes the plant produce the Cry1Ab protein, a toxin that kills certain lepidopteran (caterpillar) pests but is harmless to mammals, birds, and most other non\u2011target organisms.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration of how the safety\u2011assessment pipeline described earlier was applied to Bt\u202fcorn and how the data led to regulatory approval in the United States, the European Union, Canada, Brazil, and many other countries.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Molecular characterisation  \n\n| What was done | What the data showed |\n|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Gene insertion** \u2013 The *cry1Ab* gene (\u22481.1\u202fkb) plus a promoter from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV 35S) and a terminator from the *nos* gene were inserted into the corn genome via particle bombardment. | The inserted DNA was a single, well\u2011defined cassette.

Allergenicity assessment  \n\n| Test | Finding |\n|------|---------|\n| **Sequence similarity** \u2013 Cry1Ab compared to >\u202f2,000 known allergenic proteins (FAO/WHO 2001 criteria). | No >\u202f35\u202f% identity over an 80\u2011aa window; no exact matches to known allergens. |\n| **Pepsin resistance** \u2013 As above, rapid degradation. | Consistent with a low allergenic potential. |\n| **Serum IgE binding** \u2013 Sera from individuals allergic to corn or to *B. thuringiensis* spores were screened. | No detectable IgE binding to Cry1Ab. |\n| **Animal model** \u2013 Mice sensitised to a known allergen (ovalbumin) were fed Cry1Ab protein; no increase in IgE or anaphylactic signs. | Negative. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.
