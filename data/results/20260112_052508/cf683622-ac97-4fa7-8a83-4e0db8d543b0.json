The main macro\u2011economic goals are to lower long\u2011term interest rates, stimulate credit growth, and raise aggregate demand when the policy\u2011rate is already at (or near) zero.\n\nBecause QE works through *financial\u2011market* channels rather than by directly handing cash to households, its *distributional* consequences are indirect and arise from a handful of well\u2011studied mechanisms.

The numbers are taken from official central\u2011bank releases, commercial\u2011bank data, and peer\u2011reviewed studies covering the three major QE episodes of the last two decades (U.S. Fed, ECB, Bank of England).\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The 10\u2011yr yield becomes the benchmark for many other rates. | Lower benchmark \u2192 banks can fund themselves cheaper (cheaper wholesale funding, lower repo rates). |\n| **(b) Yield\u2011curve compression** | The whole curve (2\u2011yr, 5\u2011yr, 10\u2011yr) shifts down; the spread between short\u2011 and long\u2011term rates narrows. | Banks\u2019 cost of borrowing for mortgages (which are typically priced off the 10\u2011yr Treasury plus a spread) falls. Auto\u2011loan rates, which are often tied to the 5\u2011yr Treasury or to LIBOR/OIS, also drop. | The bank\u2019s \u201ccost of funds\u201d falls, so the spread it adds to set the retail rate can shrink or stay the same, yielding a lower quoted rate for the consumer. |\n| **(c) Credit\u2011risk premium compression** | With abundant liquidity, investors chase riskier assets, pushing corporate bond yields and securitised\u2011loan yields down. | The \u201ccredit spread\u201d that banks charge for lending to households (reflecting default risk) narrows because the overall risk premium in the market is lower. | The net effect is an extra 10\u201130\u202fbasis\u2011point (0.10\u20110.30\u202f%) reduction in the APR that a borrower sees. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
