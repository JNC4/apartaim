      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary\u2011policy tool that changes the composition of assets held by the central bank and, through a chain of market reactions, can affect many different groups in the economy.**  \nBelow is a structured overview of the main channels through which QE works, the groups that are most likely to feel each effect, and the empirical evidence that supports (or questions) those links. Where possible I note where the evidence is strong, where it is mixed, and where the debate continues.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How QE works \u2013 a quick refresher  \n\n| Step | What the central bank does | Immediate market impact |\n|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Asset purchases** | Buys large amounts of government bonds, and sometimes corporate bonds, mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS), or even \u201cgreen\u201d bonds. | Raises the price of those securities \u2192 lowers their yields (the \u201cpolicy rate\u201d falls further). |\n| **Balance\u2011sheet expansion** | Increases the amount of reserves in the banking system. | Banks have more liquid assets and can lend at lower rates. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Private investors (banks, pension funds, households, funds) sell the securities they hold to the central bank and use the cash to buy other assets (stocks, housing, corporate debt, etc.). | Drives up prices of a broad set of assets and reduces risk premia. |\n| **Expectations channel** | Signals that the central bank intends to keep rates low for an extended period and to support the economy. | Influences consumption, investment, and wage\u2011setting behavior. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** (in open economies) | Lower domestic yields make the currency relatively less attractive. | Depreciates the exchange rate, boosting net\u2011exports. |\n\nThese mechanisms are not mutually exclusive; the net outcome for any group depends on which channel dominates in a given country and at a given time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Main groups that feel the impact  \n\n| Group | Primary QE channels that affect them | Typical direction of impact | Strength of evidence |\n|------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Household savers (especially low\u2011income, cash\u2011rich, non\u2011asset owners)** | \u2013 Lower short\u2011term interest rates on deposits and Treasury\u2011linked savings products <br>\u2013 Reduced yields on safe assets (government bonds, high\u2011grade corporate bonds) | **Negative** \u2013 lower nominal returns on cash and \u201csafe\u201d savings; may encourage risk\u2011taking or reduce retirement\u2011income adequacy. | Empirical work (e.g., Bivens & Zwick 2022, IMF 2020) finds a modest but measurable decline in real yields on low\u2011risk assets during QE episodes. |\n| **Household owners of financial assets (stocks, bonds, REITs)** | \u2013 Portfolio\u2011rebalancing lifts equity and high\u2011yield bond prices <br>\u2013 Lower discount rates increase firm valuations | **Positive** \u2013 higher capital gains, higher wealth, higher \u201cunrealized\u201d net worth. | Strong consensus: US QE rounds (2008\u20112014) raised the S&P\u202f500 by ~15\u201120\u202f% (Krishnamurthy & Vissing\u2011Jorgensen 2011). |\n| **Homeowners (especially those with mortgages)** | \u2013 Lower mortgage rates (via MBS purchases) <br>\u2013 Higher house prices (portfolio shift into real estate) | **Mixed**: lower borrowing costs (positive) but rising home values can increase wealth for owners and affordability pressure for renters. | Studies (e.g., Gagnon et al. 2011, Saiki 2020) find mortgage\u2011rate cuts of 50\u2011100\u202fbp and house\u2011price gains of 5\u201110",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **worked\u2011example** that shows how the balance sheet of a \u201ctypical\u201d middle\u2011class family in the United States (or a comparable advanced\u2011economy household) could evolve over the course of a quantitative\u2011easing (QE) programme that lasts roughly **four years**\u2014the length of the Fed\u2019s \u201cQE\u20112\u201d (Nov\u202f2010\u202f\u2192\u202fJun\u202f2012) and \u201cQE\u20113\u201d (Sep\u202f2012\u202f\u2192\u202fOct\u202f2014) episodes combined.\n\nThe numbers are **illustrative**, not taken from a single real family, but they are built from averages reported by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and academic estimates of QE\u2019s asset\u2011price effects.

Empirical work (e.g., Desmond & Kimbro 2015; Glaeser et\u202fal. 2020) finds a **roughly 0.5\u202f%\u20131\u202f% rent\u2011increase for each 1\u202f% rise in house prices** in markets where rent control is weak. Over an 8\u202f% house\u2011price jump, that translates to a **4\u202f%\u20138\u202f% rise in median rents**. <br>*Indirect negative*: Higher home equity can make it easier for landlords to refinance at lower rates and invest in upgrades, but it can also increase the **cost of entry** for a renter who wants to become a homeowner later (down\u2011payment expectations rise). |\n| **Expectations / \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d channel** | Lower rates raise consumer confidence and spending, which can push up **prices of non\u2011durable goods** (food, services). | *Neutral/negative*: Renters who spend a larger share of income on consumption see a modest **cost\u2011of\u2011living pressure**. The overall effect on disposable income depends on the balance between lower borrowing costs and higher prices. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate / import\u2011price channel** (in open economies) | A weaker domestic currency can raise the price of imported goods. | *Negative* for renters who have a larger share of their budget devoted to imported food, electronics, or gasoline.
