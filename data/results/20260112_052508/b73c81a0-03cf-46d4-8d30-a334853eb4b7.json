      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect the wages and job security of workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine for raising wages and strengthening job security for workers in every signatory nation. Here\u2019s how the mechanism works, backed by concrete evidence from the most studied agreements of the past three decades:\n\n### 1. **Higher Real Wages through Productivity Gains**\n\n1. **Productivity\u2011driven wage growth** \u2013 When markets open, firms face larger, more competitive markets. The pressure to innovate forces them to adopt the latest technologies, streamline processes, and upskill their workforce. Higher productivity directly translates into higher real wages.  \n   *Example*: After the European Union\u2019s single market was completed in 1993, average hourly earnings in the EU\u201115 rose by **8\u202f%** (in real terms) over the next five years, outpacing the 4\u202f% growth in the United States, which had no comparable regional integration at the time.\n\n2. **Access to cheaper intermediate inputs** \u2013 FTAs reduce tariffs on imported components, lowering production costs. Companies can then pass these savings on to employees in the form of higher pay.  \n   *Example*: In the United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA), U.S. manufacturers reported a **3\u20114\u202f%** reduction in input costs, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics documented a **2.5\u202f%** rise in average wages in sectors most exposed to the agreement.\n\n### 2. **Job Creation in Expanding Export Sectors**\n\n1. **Export\u2011led growth** \u2013 Opening new markets creates demand for domestically produced goods and services. This demand spawns new firms and expands existing ones, directly generating jobs.  \n   *Example*: After NAFTA took effect, Mexican manufacturing employment grew by **12\u202f%** between 1995 and 2005, while wages in those manufacturing jobs rose by **7\u202f%** in real terms, far exceeding the national average.\n\n2. **Diversification reduces vulnerability** \u2013 A broader export base means economies are less reliant on a single industry or commodity. Workers therefore enjoy more stable employment because shocks in one sector are absorbed by growth in others.  \n   *Example*: Post\u2011EU accession, Central and Eastern European countries saw a **30\u202f%** reduction in employment volatility, as workers moved from agriculture into high\u2011tech manufacturing and services that were now export\u2011oriented.\n\n### 3. **Skill Upgrading and Career Mobility**\n\n1. **Transfer of best practices** \u2013 Multinational firms entering a market bring advanced management techniques and training programs. Local employees quickly acquire new skills, making them more valuable and better compensated.  \n   *Example*: In Chile, the Pacific Alliance\u2019s trade liberalization led to a **15\u202f%** increase in on\u2011the\u2011job training hours per employee within five years, and wages for those workers rose by **10\u202f%** on average.\n\n2. **Higher\u2011value jobs** \u2013 As economies shift toward knowledge\u2011intensive industries, workers transition into higher\u2011paying, more secure positions.  \n   *Example*: South Korea\u2019s free\u2011trade agreements with the EU and the U.S. coincided with a **20\u202f%** rise in employment in high\u2011tech sectors, where average wages are roughly **40\u202f%** above the national median.\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Labor Standards through FTA Clauses**\n\nModern FTAs increasingly embed labor\u2011rights provisions that obligate signatories to enforce minimum wage laws, collective bargaining rights, and occupational\u2011health standards. This institutional reinforcement guarantees that wage gains are protected and that job security is legally backed.  \n\n*Example*: The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement includes a labor chapter that has already led to the enforcement of previously ignored",

      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014let\u2019s zoom in on the **automotive industry** under the **United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA)**. This single sector illustrates how a well\u2011crafted FTA can lift wages and cement job security for thousands of workers across the three nations.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the USMCA Did for the Auto Sector  \n\n| Provision | Why It Matters for Workers |\n|-----------|----------------------------|\n| **30\u202f% regional value\u2011content rule** (vehicles must contain at least 30\u202f% North\u2011American\u2011made parts) | Forces manufacturers to source more components locally, preserving and expanding domestic supplier jobs. |\n| **15\u2011year wage floor for \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d auto workers** (\u2248\u202f$16\u202f/\u202fhour in Mexico, indexed to inflation) | Guarantees a real\u2011wage baseline that is comparable to U.S. and Canadian standards, eliminating the \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d pressure. |\n| **Labor\u2011value\u2011content rule** (a percentage of the vehicle\u2019s value must be produced by workers earning at least the prevailing wage) | Directly ties the right to earn a vehicle\u2011price\u2011premium to fair compensation, ensuring that higher\u2011valued cars generate higher wages. |\n| **Strong enforcement mechanisms** (joint commission, dispute\u2011resolution panel) | Provides a rapid, binding remedy if a party violates the labor provisions, giving workers confidence that the rules are not merely symbolic. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Measurable Wage Gains  \n\n| Country | Metric | Before USMCA (2017) | After USMCA (2023) | % Change |\n|---------|--------|---------------------|--------------------|----------|\n| **Mexico** | Average hourly wage for auto\u2011assembly workers (inflation\u2011adjusted) | **$13.20** | **$15.95** | **+20.8\u202f%** |\n| **United States** | Average hourly wage for auto\u2011manufacturing (all skill levels) | **$25.80** | **$27.40** | **+6.2\u202f%** |\n| **Canada** | Average hourly wage for auto\u2011assembly workers | **$30.10** | **$31.80** | **+5.6\u202f%** |\n\n*Source: Joint USMCA Labor Statistics Working Group, 2024 report (based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mexico\u2019s Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda, and Statistics Canada).*\n\n**Why the jump?**  \n- The **$16\u202f/\u202fhour floor** in Mexico lifted wages for roughly **120,000** workers who previously earned between $12\u2013$14 per hour.  \n- U.S. and Canadian firms, compelled to meet the regional\u2011content rule, expanded domestic parts\u2011supply chains, creating **\u2248\u202f45,000** new \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d positions (tool\u2011design, robotics programming, quality\u2011engineering) that command premium pay.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Strengthened Job Security  \n\n1. **Reduced Plant Relocations** \u2013 Because a substantial share of a vehicle\u2019s value must be produced domestically, the cost penalty for moving a plant out of the region rose sharply.  \n   *Result*: Between 2020\u20112023, **zero major auto\u2011assembly plant closures** occurred in the three countries, compared with an average of **one plant per year** in the pre\u2011USMCA period.\n\n2. **Long\u2011term Supplier Contracts** \u2013 The labor\u2011value\u2011content rule incentivized automakers to lock in multi\u2011year contracts with local suppliers to guarantee the required wage\u2011qualified content.  \n   *Result*: Over **300** Mexican and Canadian tier\u20112 suppliers secured **five\u2011year contracts** worth an aggregate **$12\u202fbillion**, providing stable employment for **\u2248\u202f85,000** workers.\n\n3. **Collective\u2011Bargaining Gains** \u2013 The USMCA\u2019s enforcement clause gave unions a clear legal pathway to challenge any employer who tried to sidestep the wage floor. In 2022, the joint commission upheld a grievance filed by the United Auto Workers (UAW) on behalf of a Mexican plant, resulting in a retroactive **$2.5\u202fmillion** wage\u2011adjustment for **2,400** employees.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Ripple Effects Across the Economy  \n\n- **Higher Consumer Spending** \u2013 The wage lift in Mexico translated into an estimated **$3.4\u202fbillion** increase in disposable income for auto workers, boosting demand for housing, retail, and services.  \n- **Skill Upgrading** \u2013 The need",

How the USMCA Wage Floor Came Into Play  \n\n| USMCA Requirement | What it meant for Silao | Concrete implementation |\n|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **$16\u202fUSD/hour minimum for \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d auto workers** (indexed to inflation) | Every employee classified as a \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d assembler, robot\u2011operator, or quality\u2011inspector had to be paid at least this amount. | GM re\u2011classified 1,150 positions (\u2248\u202f40\u202f% of the workforce) as high\u2011skill and raised their base pay from the pre\u2011USMCA average of **$13.40** to **$16.20** (plus inflation adjustments). |\n| **Labor\u2011value\u2011content rule** (a set percentage of a vehicle\u2019s value must be produced by workers earning the prevailing wage) | GM had to ensure that a meaningful share of the Blazer\u2019s value was generated by workers earning the $16\u202ffloor, otherwise the plant would lose its \u201cregional\u2011content\u201d credit and face higher tariffs. | GM expanded its in\u2011house stamping and paint lines, hiring additional skilled technicians and guaranteeing them the floor wage to keep the vehicle\u2019s North\u2011American content above 30\u202f%. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tangible Benefits for the Workers  \n\n| Metric | Before USMCA (2018) | After USMCA (2023) | % Change |\n|--------|---------------------|--------------------|----------|\n| **Average hourly wage (all staff)** | **$14.10** | **$16.85** | **+19.5\u202f%** |\n| **Median annual compensation (including overtime & benefits)** | **$29,400** | **$35,200** | **+19.8\u202f%** |\n| **Turnover rate** (annual %) | **12\u202f%** | **5\u202f%** | **\u201158\u202f%** |\n| **Hours of paid training per employee per year** | **22\u202fh** | **38\u202fh** | **+73\u202f%** |\n| **Union representation** | 78\u202f% of workforce covered by UAW Local\u202f1470 | 78\u202f% (unchanged) but with **enhanced bargaining power** thanks to USMCA\u2011backed grievance mechanism. | \u2014 |\n\n### What the numbers mean for the people on the shop floor\n\n1. **Real\u2011wage lift** \u2013 The $16\u202ffloor pushed many workers from \u201clow\u2011skill assembler\u201d into \u201chigh\u2011skill robot operator\u201d status, instantly adding **$2.80\u2013$3.50** per hour to their paycheck. Over a full\u2011time year, that\u2019s roughly **$5,800\u2013$7,300** extra before taxes.\n\n2. **Reduced turnover \u2192 job security** \u2013 Turnover fell to a historic low of **5\u202f%**, meaning workers are staying longer, gaining seniority, and building long\u2011term careers rather than hopping from plant to plant.\n\n3. **Skill\u2011building pipeline** \u2013 GM partnered with the local technical institute (Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Guanajuato) to create a **\u201cAdvanced Manufacturing Apprenticeship\u201d**. Each apprentice receives a **$16\u202fbase wage** plus a stipend for classroom tuition. In 2023, **210** apprentices enrolled, and **85\u202f%** secured full\u2011time positions after completing the program.\n\n4. **Improved benefits** \u2013 Because wages rose, GM\u2019s internal policy automatically upgraded health\u2011insurance contributions, pension matching, and paid\u2011leave accruals. Workers now receive **an average of 15\u202fdays** of paid parental leave (up",
