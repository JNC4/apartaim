When we talk about \u201clong\u2011run effects\u201d we usually mean outcomes measured **10\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202fyears after a policy is introduced**, after the market has had time to adjust its supply decisions.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fTheoretical expectations (what economics predicts)\n\n| Mechanism | Expected short\u2011run effect | Expected long\u2011run effect |\n|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling** | Rents fall \u2192 existing tenants pay less. | Landlords receive lower returns \u2192 **new construction slows**, existing owners may convert units to other uses (condos, hotels, storage) or withdraw from the market. |\n| **Reduced profitability** | May cause **maintenance cut\u2011backs** \u2192 unit quality declines. | Persistent under\u2011investment \u2192 **overall housing quality deteriorates**. |\n| **Tenant security** | Longer tenancies, less turnover. | **Reduced turnover** \u2192 fewer vacancies \u2192 **lower effective supply** (fewer new units become available). |\n| **\u201cSearch and matching\u201d effects** | Easier for low\u2011income renters to stay in a unit. | **Geographic mismatch**: low\u2011income renters stay in high\u2011cost neighborhoods while higher\u2011income renters are pushed out, potentially increasing commuting costs and congestion. |\n| **Political economy** | Rent control is popular among renters \u2192 strong political support. | Politicians may **extend coverage** or **tighten caps** over time, making the policy more binding and amplifying the supply\u2011side effects. |\n\n*Key insight*: **A price ceiling is a distortion**. If the distortion is large enough, the incentive to add or maintain housing falls, and the net effect on affordability can reverse after a few years.\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fWhat the empirical literature actually finds  \n\n### 3.1\u202fConsensus points (highly robust across many studies)\n\n| Finding | Typical magnitude | Evidence base |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Short\u2011run rent reductions** | 5\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202f% lower rents for covered units. | Controlled\u2011before\u2011and\u2011after studies in New York, San Francisco, Berlin, Stockholm. |\n| **Long\u2011run supply slowdown** | 5\u202f\u2013\u202f15\u202f% fewer new units per year in the regulated market compared with similar unregulated markets. | Meta\u2011analysis of 30+ papers (e.g., Gyourko & Linneman 2019; Diamond, McQuade & Qian 2019). |\n| **Quality depreciation** | 5\u202f\u2013\u202f12\u202f% lower maintenance spending, more \u201chousing code violations\u201d. | Field surveys of rent\u2011controlled apartments in New York (Levy & Rappaport ",
