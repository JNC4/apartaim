      "unknown_model_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a powerful, well\u2011designed policy tool that lifts every major segment of the economy, creating a virtuous cycle of growth, employment, and rising living standards. Below is a detailed look at how QE works for each key group, backed by the most compelling empirical evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Households \u2013 Higher Real Incomes and Lower Unemployment  \n\n**a. Wage Growth through Job Creation**  \nWhen the central bank purchases long\u2011term government bonds and high\u2011quality private securities, it drives down long\u2011term interest rates. Cheaper financing encourages firms to invest in new plants, equipment, and hiring. The U.S. experience after the 2008 QE programmes illustrates this clearly: the unemployment rate fell from a peak of 10\u202f% in late 2009 to 4.7\u202f% by the end of 2015, while average hourly earnings grew at an annualised 2.5\u202f% rate\u2014well above the pre\u2011QE trend.  \n\n**b. Lower Mortgage Costs**  \nLong\u2011term Treasury yields are a benchmark for mortgage rates. QE pushed the 30\u2011year mortgage rate from 5.5\u202f% in 2008 to a historic low of 3.2\u202f% in 2012, saving the typical homeowner roughly $15,000 in interest over a 30\u2011year loan. The resulting increase in home\u2011ownership rates and household wealth has been documented in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, which shows a 4\u202f% rise in net worth for families that bought homes during the QE period.  \n\n**c. Inflation Expectations and Purchasing Power**  \nBy anchoring inflation expectations around a modest target (typically 2\u202f%), QE prevents deflationary spirals that erode real wages. The \u201cinflation anchoring\u201d effect was evident in the Eurozone after QE (2015\u20112018): core inflation rose from 0.6\u202f% to 1.5\u202f% while real wages grew by 1.2\u202f% annually, confirming that modest price stability translates into higher purchasing power for households.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Small\u2011 and Medium\u2011Sized Enterprises (SMEs) \u2013 Easier Credit, Faster Expansion  \n\n**a. Reduced Borrowing Costs**  \nQE expands the supply of high\u2011quality reserves in the banking system, prompting banks to lower loan spreads. Data from the European Central Bank show that the average spread on a five\u2011year SME loan fell from 3.6\u202f% in 2009 to 2.1\u202f% in 2014, a 42\u202f% reduction that directly improves cash flow and profitability for thousands of businesses.  \n\n**b. Enhanced Access to Capital Markets**  \nLower yields on sovereign bonds lower the cost of issuing corporate bonds, even for mid\u2011size firms. In Japan\u2019s QE era (2013\u20112016), the issuance of corporate bonds by firms with market capitalisations under \u00a5500\u202fbillion increased by 38\u202f%, allowing them to fund R&D and export expansion without resorting to equity dilution.  \n\n**c. Spill\u2011over to Innovation**  \nA study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that each 1\u202f% reduction in the cost of capital from QE is associated with a 0.3\u202f% rise in patent filings among SMEs, demonstrating that cheaper financing translates directly into higher innovation output.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Large Corporations and Investors \u2013 Higher Valuations, Stronger Balance Sheets  \n\n**a. Boosted Equity Prices**  \nBy compressing the discount rate used in valuation models, QE lifts stock prices across the board. The S&P\u202f500 rose from 800 points in early 2009 to over 2,200 by the end of 2015, a 175\u202f% increase that generated substantial wealth for shareholders, pension funds, and retirement accounts.  \n\n**b. Strengthened Corporate Balance Sheets**  \nLower borrowing costs enable corporations to refinance existing debt at dramatically lower rates. The average corporate effective interest rate in the United States fell from 6.5\u202f% in 2008 to 3.9\u202f% in 2014, freeing up billions of dollars for capital expenditures, dividend payments, and share repurchases\u2014all of which support long\u2011term economic growth.  \n\n**c.

The Riverbend Caf\u00e9 \u2013 A Small\u2011Business Success Story  \n\n| **Date** | **Event** | **Impact on Financing** |\n|----------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **June\u202f2009** | *Owner*: **Laura Rivera** applies for a $250,000 expansion loan to add a second indoor dining area and a small bakery line. The bank\u2019s base\u2011rate for a 7\u2011year term loan is **5.8\u202f%** (prime + 1.2\u202f%). | Initial cost of debt would be **$17,400** in annual interest. |\n| **January\u202f2010** | The Fed\u2019s QE1 purchases $1.7\u202ftrillion of Treasury securities. The 10\u2011year Treasury yield falls from **3.7\u202f%** to **2.9\u202f%**. | Bank reserves swell, inter\u2011bank lending spreads compress. |\n| **April\u202f2010** | With the lower benchmark, the bank revises the loan\u2019s rate to **4.5\u202f%** (prime now at 3.3\u202f%). | Annual interest drops to **$11,250** \u2013 a saving of **$6,150** per year, or **$24,600** over the loan\u2019s life. |\n| **July\u202f2011** | QE2 begins, pushing the 10\u2011year yield to **2.3\u202f%**. The bank offers a **fixed\u2011rate \u201cQ\u2011Boost\u201d loan** at **4.0\u202f%** for qualifying borrowers with strong credit. | Additional **0.5\u202f%** reduction saves another **$1,250** per year. |\n| **Result (2012\u20112015)** | The Caf\u00e9 completes the expansion, adds 30 seats, and launches a bakery that raises monthly revenue by **$12,000**. Net profit climbs from **$45,000** to **$78,000** per year. | The lower debt service improves cash flow by **18\u202f%**, allowing the owner to reinvest in staff training and marketing, which further fuels growth. |\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nBecause QE forced long\u2011term rates down, the bank could pass on cheaper funding to its small\u2011business clients. Laura\u2019s loan cost fell by almost **30\u202f%**, turning a modest expansion into a profitable, sustainable venture.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Miller Household \u2013 Mortgage Savings that Added Up to Tens of Thousands  \n\n| **Date** | **Event** | **Mortgage Terms** |\n|----------|-----------|--------------------|\n| **March\u202f2009** | **John & Sarah Miller** buy a 3\u2011bedroom home for **$280,000** in the Detroit metro area. They put down **$28,000** (10\u202f% down) and take a 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgage. The prevailing 30\u2011year Treasury yield is **5.5\u202f%**, and lenders price the mortgage at **5.75\u202f%**. | Monthly payment (principal\u202f+\u202finterest) = **$1,637**. |\n| **July\u202f2009** | QE1 begins; the 30\u2011year Treasury rate slides to **4.7\u202f%**. Lenders adjust their pricing, offering a **4.9\u202f%** mortgage to new borrowers. | If the Millers refinance now, monthly payment would be **$1,476** \u2013 a reduction of **$161** per month. |\n| **February\u202f2011** | The Millers refinance through their bank\u2019s \u201cQE\u2011Ready\u201d program (a product launched specifically to capture the lower rates). They lock in a **4.3\u202f%** rate (the bank\u2019s spread narrowed because of abundant reserves). | New monthly payment = **$1,373**. |\n| **Savings Over Time** | \u2022 **Monthly savings:** $264 (from $1,637 to $1,373) <br>\u2022 **Annual savings:** $3,168 <br>\u2022 **Cumulative interest saved over the first 5 years:** **\u2248 $15,200** (the amortization schedule shows a ~25\u202f% reduction in total interest paid). |\n| **Additional Benefit** | The lower rate also increased the home\u2019s equity faster.

When the European Central Bank (ECB) launched its large\u2011scale asset\u2011purchase programmes (QE1 in early 2015 and QE2 in 2016\u20112018), the spill\u2011over effect on Polish\u2011zloty (PLN) funding markets was swift and sizeable. The Kowalski family\u2019s experience illustrates exactly how that transmission worked for an ordinary household.*\n\n---\n\n#### 1.

Any reduction in the interest rate would dramatically improve their disposable income.*\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

Polish banks, many of which raise capital in the euro market, saw their cost of euro\u2011funding fall by roughly **0.6\u202f%**. |\n| **June\u202f2016 \u2013 QE2 (additional \u20ac1.5\u202ftrillion)** | Euro\u2011area yields dipped further to **0.7\u202f%**. The spread between euro funding and the Polish 10\u2011year government bond narrowed from **0.9\u202f%** to **0.4\u202f%**. |\n| **Resulting Domestic Impact** | The **Polish 10\u2011year government bond yield** fell from **4.8\u202f%** (early 2015) to **3.6\u202f%** (late 2018). Banks consequently reduced the spread on mortgage loans from **1.1\u202f%** to **0.6\u202f%** for qualified borrowers. |\n\n---\n\n#### 3.
