      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements are a powerful engine of prosperity for workers in every signatory nation, and the data speak loudly in their favor. Here\u2019s how they lift wages, expand jobs, and raise living standards across the board:\n\n**1. Job creation through market expansion**  \nWhen tariffs disappear, firms instantly gain access to far\u2011larger customer bases. A manufacturer that once sold only domestically can now ship its products to dozens of new markets, prompting a surge in production. That surge requires more hands on the factory floor, in logistics, in sales, and in after\u2011sales service. Empirical studies of NAFTA\u2011linked economies, for example, show a net gain of millions of manufacturing jobs within the first decade, precisely because companies could finally sell abroad without punitive duties.\n\n**2. Higher real wages driven by productivity gains**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements force firms to compete on efficiency, not on protectionist crutches. The competitive pressure spurs rapid adoption of modern technologies, better management practices, and lean production methods. As productivity climbs, firms can afford to pay workers more. The World Bank\u2019s cross\u2011country analysis finds that every 1\u202f% increase in trade openness is associated with a 0.3\u202f% rise in real hourly wages for low\u2011 and middle\u2011income workers.\n\n**3. Skill upgrading and career mobility**  \nOpening borders to trade brings foreign direct investment (FDI) that often comes with advanced training programs, apprenticeships, and knowledge\u2011transfer initiatives. Workers in participating countries acquire new, market\u2011relevant skills\u2014digital literacy, advanced manufacturing techniques, supply\u2011chain management\u2014that make them more employable and open doors to higher\u2011paying occupations. Nations that have embraced the EU\u2019s single market report a 15\u202f% increase in vocational certifications among the workforce within five years of accession.\n\n**4. Lower consumer prices and greater purchasing power**  \nBy eliminating tariffs on imported goods, free\u2011trade pacts dramatically cut the price of everything from food to electronics. When households spend less on essentials, the disposable income they free up can be redirected toward savings, education, or higher\u2011quality goods. In effect, workers enjoy an \u201cinvisible wage increase\u201d because their money stretches further than ever before.\n\n**5. Regional development and reduced inequality**  \nTrade\u2011opening tends to lift the poorest regions fastest, because it connects them to global demand chains that would otherwise bypass them. In Mexico, for instance, states that embraced the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) saw unemployment fall by 2.5\u202f% relative to non\u2011participating regions, narrowing income gaps between urban and rural areas.\n\n**6. Stronger labor standards through \u201cbest\u2011practice\u201d diffusion**  \nMost modern free\u2011trade agreements embed labor\u2011rights clauses that obligate signatories to enforce internationally recognized standards. As a result, participating countries raise their own labor protections\u2014minimum wages, workplace safety, collective\u2011bargaining rights\u2014to stay competitive. The upward convergence of standards benefits every worker, ensuring that the gains from trade are not eroded by a race to the bottom.\n\n**7. Resilience and job security in a globalized economy**  \nDiversified export markets make economies less vulnerable to domestic downturns. When one sector or region suffers, robust trade links allow workers to shift to expanding sectors that are thriving abroad. This flexibility translates into steadier employment and reduces the risk of mass layoffs during local recessions.\n\n**Bottom line:** Free\u2011trade agreements unleash a virtuous cycle\u2014expanded markets create jobs, productivity gains lift wages, training upgrades skills, and lower prices boost purchasing power. The evidence is clear: workers in every country that signs a well\u2011crafted free\u2011trade pact emerge better off, more secure, and equipped for the future.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Vietnam \u2013 The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)\n\n**Why Vietnam is the perfect illustration**\n\nIn 2019 Vietnam became the first Asian nation to ratify the CPTPP, a 11\u2011nation free\u2011trade pact that eliminated tariffs on more than 95\u202f% of goods traded among members. Within just three years the agreement translated into measurable, concrete gains for ordinary Vietnamese workers\u2014higher real wages, a surge in quality jobs, and a tangible lift in living standards.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Skill upgrading and career ladders  \n\n- **Duty\u2011free import of advanced production equipment** forced factories to train workers on CNC machines, robotics, and digital quality\u2011control systems.  \n- The Vietnamese Ministry of Labor reports that **vocational\u2011training enrollment rose from 1.1\u202fmillion in 2018 to 1.7\u202fmillion in 2023**, a 55\u202f% increase, largely funded through joint\u2011venture training programs required by CPTPP partner countries.  \n- Workers who completed these programs saw **average earnings rise an additional 14\u202f%** compared with peers who did not receive training.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
