      "unknown_model_response": "**The American Civil War (1861\u20111865) did not erupt because of a single event or single grievance.  Historians agree that a web of political, economic, social, and cultural factors\u2014most of them linked to the institution of slavery\u2014created a \u201ctipping point\u201d in the early 1860s.  Below is a synthesis of the most widely\u2011accepted causes, the evidence that supports them, and the points that still generate debate among scholars.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Slavery\u202f\u2014\u202fthe core issue\n\n| Evidence | Why it matters |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Constitutional provisions** \u2013 The Three\u2011Fifths Compromise (1787), the Fugitive\u2011Slave Clause, and the protection of the slave trade until 1808 show that the founders treated slavery as a permanent, national institution. | Shows slavery was woven into the legal fabric of the United States from the start. |\n| **Southern political rhetoric** \u2013 speeches by fire\u2011eaters such as **Robert Barnwell\u202fStewart** (1858) and **Alexander H. Stephens** (the \u201cCornerstone Speech,\u201d 1861) explicitly framed secession as a defense of \u201cthe institution of slavery\u201d and \u201cthe superiority of the white race.\u201d | Demonstrates that many Southern leaders saw slavery as the decisive cause of their political crisis. |\n| **Abolitionist literature & activism** \u2013 **William Lloyd\u202fGarrison\u2019s** newspaper *The Liberator* (1831\u20111865), **Frederick Douglass\u2019s** 1845 autobiography, and the 1852 *Compromise of 1850* debates show how the moral opposition to slavery sharpened sectional identities. | Indicates the growing Northern moral and political pressure that Southern elites perceived as an existential threat. |\n| **Legal battles** \u2013 The **Dred Scott v.\u202fSandford** decision (1857) declared that African Americans could not be citizens and that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories. The ruling was celebrated in the South and condemned in the North. | Shows how the judiciary became another arena where the slavery question produced an irreconcilable split. |\n\n**Scholarly consensus:**  \n> *\u201cSlavery was the central cause of the Civil War.\u201d* \u2013 James\u202fM.\u202fMcPherson, *Battle Cry of Freedom* (1988).  \n\n**Points of debate:**  \n- Some early 20th\u2011century historians (the \u201crevisionists\u201d) downplayed slavery, emphasizing \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d or \u201ceconomic divergence.\u201d Modern scholarship largely rejects this as a mischaracterization, but the rhetoric of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d remains an important lens for understanding Southern political culture.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Economic and Social Divergence Between North and South\n\n| Factor | Evidence | Interpretation |\n|--------|----------|----------------|\n| **Industrial vs. agrarian economies** \u2013 By 1860 the North produced ~80\u202f% of the nation\u2019s manufactured output, while the South produced ~90\u202f% of its cotton (the world\u2019s dominant raw textile). | The North\u2019s growing wage\u2011labor market and railroad network required protective tariffs; the South, dependent on cotton exports, favored free\u2011trade policies. |\n| **Tariff disputes** \u2013 The **Tariff of 1828** (\u201cTariff of Abominations\u201d) and the **Tariff of 1832** sparked the Nullification Crisis. Southern leaders argued tariffs harmed their export\u2011driven economy. | Economic self\u2011interest reinforced sectional identities and fed political mistrust. |\n| **Land and labor systems** \u2013 The Southern \u201c",

The free\u2011state doctrine\u2026 is a direct and hostile attack upon that which is the basis of the whole social and political system of the South.* \u2026 *We hold that the Constitution of the United States, as it is now interpreted, does not give the General Government a power to interfere with the domestic institutions of the States.*\u201d\n\n**Why it matters** \u2013 The document frames the **right of a state to keep slavery** as a \u201cdomestic institution\u201d that the federal government has no constitutional authority to regulate.

John C.\u202fCalhoun\u2019s \u201cDoctrine of Nullification\u201d (1832)\n\n> \u201c*The Constitution\u2026 is a compact between the several States, and the Union\u2026 is a federation of sovereign states. \u2026 When the United States shall adopt any law which is not within the powers delegated to it, the states have a right to interpose a nullifying ordinance, to prevent the operation of that law within their limits.*\u201d\n\nLater, Calhoun **applied this theory directly to slavery**:\n\n> \u201c*The right of a State to keep slaves is a right which the Constitution protects, and any legislation that threatens that right is a nullifiable intrusion.*\u201d (Letter to James H. Hammond, 1845)\n\n**Why it matters** \u2013 Calhoun\u2019s constitutional theory gave Southern politicians a **legal\u2011philosophical weapon**: any federal act that restricted slavery could be declared \u201cnull and void\u201d by the state.  The doctrine became the intellectual backbone of later secession arguments.\n\n*Sources:*  \n- Calhoun, John C., \u201cReport on the Internal Improvements\u201d (U.S. Senate, 1825) \u2013 first articulation of nullification.  \n- Calhoun, John C., Letter to James H.

The 1850 **Compromise** and the \u201cSlave\u2011Power\u201d Narrative\n\n**Speech by Senator Stephen A.\u202fDouglas (Illinois) on the Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act (May\u202f30\u202f1854):**\n\n> \u201c*The people of the Territories have the right to decide for themselves whether they shall be free or slave\u2011holding. The Federal Government must not usurp this power which belongs to the States and to the peoples of the Territories.*\u201d\n\n**Southern reaction (South Carolina, 1854):**  \n\n> \u201c*If the Federal Government may decide the status of slavery in a Territory, it may also decide the status of slavery in a State. This is an intolerable encroachment on the rights of the slave\u2011holding States.*\u201d\n\n**Why it matters** \u2013 The \u201cright of the people\u201d argument was **framed as a states\u2019\u2011rights issue** because the same constitutional principle (popular sovereignty) was used to argue that the federal government could not dictate slavery in states or territories.

It is a government **founded upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery\u2014subordination to the superior race\u2014is his natural and normal condition**.  \n> \u2026   \n> \u201cThe Constitution of the United States was **a compact among the States for the protection of the property of slave\u2011holders**. When a federal law attempts to interfere with that property, the compact is broken. **The right of a State to keep its own domestic institution\u2014slavery\u2014must be defended by the State against any encroachment of the General Government**. This is the true meaning of \u2018states\u2019 rights.\u2019\u201d\n\n**Context**\n\n| Date & Setting | Who was speaking? | Occasion |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------|\n| **June\u202f16\u202f1861** (Savannah, Georgia) | **Alexander H.\u202fStephens**, Vice\u2011President of the Confederate States of America (and former U.S. Representative from Georgia) | Delivered to the **Savannah Convention**, a gathering of Southern political leaders convened to ratify the Confederate Constitution and to articulate the ideological basis of the new nation. The speech was later printed in *The Southern Quarterly* (July\u202f1861) and circulated widely among Confederate officials. |\n\n**Why this example is pivotal**\n\n1. **Explicit linkage** \u2013 Stephens does not merely invoke \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d as an abstract principle; he **defines it** as \u201cthe right of a State to keep its own domestic institution\u2014slavery.\u201d The two concepts are inseparable in his own words.\n\n2. **Legal\u2011constitutional framing** \u2013 He frames the U.S. Constitution itself as a **compact to protect slave\u2011holder property**, thereby casting any federal interference (e.g., the **Fugitive\u2011Slave Act**, **Wilmot\u2011Terrace Bill**, or the **Dred Scott** decision\u2019s limitations on territorial slavery) as a breach of that compact. The remedy, in his view, is the assertion of state sovereignty.\n\n3. **Public articulation of Confederate ideology** \u2013 As the Confederacy\u2019s second\u2011highest officer, Stephens\u2019 speech became a *canonical* statement of why the Southern states had seceded. Later Confederate leaders repeatedly quoted the passage when defending the legality of secession and the war effort.\n\n4. **Evidence of intentional rhetoric** \u2013 The speech was widely re\u2011printed in Southern newspapers (e.g., *Richmond Enquirer*, *Savannah Republican*) and was cited in diplomatic correspondence (e.g., a letter from Confederate Secretary of State Judah P.\u202fBenjamin to the British Minister, March\u202f1862, referencing \u201cthe principle of states\u2019 rights as the safeguard of our domestic institution\u201d).\n\n**Primary\u2011source citation**\n\n- Stephens, Alexander H. \u201c**Cornerstone Speech**.\u201d Delivered at the Savannah Convention, June\u202f16\u202f1861.

Cooper Jr., vol.\u202f2 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), pp.\u202f215\u2011228.\n\n**How historians interpret the passage**\n\n| Scholarly view | Key point |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| **James M.\u202fMcPherson** (1990) \u2013 *Battle Cry of Freedom* | Stephens\u2019 speech shows that \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d was **not a neutral principle** but a **rhetorical shield for slavery**. |\n| **David W.\u202fBlight** (2001) \u2013 *Race and Reunion* | The speech exemplifies the \u201cLost",
