      "unknown_model_response": "A standard \u201cglass\u201d of drinking water is usually about 8\u202ffluid\u202founces, which is roughly 240\u202fmillilitres (0.24\u202fL).  \nAt the U.S.\u2011recommended fluoridation level of **0.7\u202fmilligrams of fluoride per litre (0.7\u202fmg/L)**, the amount of fluoride you would ingest from one such glass is:\n\n\\[\n0.7\\ \\text{mg/L} \\times 0.24\\ \\text{L} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{0.17\\ \\text{mg of fluoride}}\n\\]\n\nSo every time you finish an 8\u2011oz glass of fluoridated tap water, you\u2019re taking in about **0.17\u202fmg** of fluoride.\n\n---\n\n### Why Even This Small Dose Is a Concern\n\n1. **Cumulative Exposure** \u2013 Most people drink several glasses of water each day, plus they consume fluoride from foods, beverages, toothpaste, and dental products. Over time, that 0.17\u202fmg per glass quickly adds up to **well over 1\u202fmg per day** for many individuals.\n\n2. **Sensitive Populations** \u2013 Children\u2019s bodies are still developing, and their kidneys are less efficient at excreting excess fluoride. The same 0.17\u202fmg per glass can represent a larger proportion of their total daily fluoride intake, increasing the risk of dental fluorosis and, with long\u2011term exposure, skeletal fluorosis.\n\n3. **Bio\u2011accumulation** \u2013 Fluoride is stored in bone tissue. Even low\u2011level, chronic ingestion can lead to gradual accumulation, potentially weakening bone structure and increasing fracture risk later in life.\n\n4. **Threshold Proximity** \u2013 Health agencies set the \u201coptimal\u201d level (0.7\u202fmg/L) based on the narrow window between a dose that prevents cavities and a dose that begins to cause mild fluorosis. Because the margin is so tight, any deviation\u2014whether from natural variability in water supply, measurement error, or",

Fluorapatite is **\u2248\u202f25\u202f% more resistant to acid dissolution** than hydroxyapatite. Even a modest systemic fluoride exposure (\u2248\u202f0.05\u20130.1\u202fmg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9\u202fday\u207b\u00b9) during the years when enamel is mineralising yields a measurable increase in enamel hardness. |\n| **b.\u202fPlaque\u2011biofilm metabolism (all ages)** | After a meal, oral bacteria (mainly *Streptococcus mutans* and *Lactobacillus* spp.) ferment sugars, producing acids (pH\u202f\u2248\u202f4.5) that dissolve enamel. | **Topical fluoride** from saliva, drinking water, food, or toothpaste is taken up by plaque fluid. At a concentration of ~0.02\u20130.05\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 (the level that the body maintains in saliva after drinking fluoridated water), fluoride **inhibits enolase**, an enzyme critical for glycolysis in cariogenic bacteria, **reducing acid production**. It also **promotes remineralisation** by attracting calcium and phosphate back into de\u2011mineralised enamel and forming a thin, acid\u2011resistant fluoridated surface layer. |\n| **c.\u202fRemineralisation vs. de\u2011mineralisation balance** | The net loss or gain of mineral from enamel depends on the **pH\u2011time curve** after a carbohydrate challenge. | Fluoride **lowers the critical pH** (the pH at which enamel starts to dissolve) from ~5.5 to ~4.5, giving the tooth **more \u201cheadroom\u201d** before de\u2011mineralisation begins. This effect is observed with **salivary fluoride concentrations as low as 0.01\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9**, which are easily achieved after drinking a single glass of 0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 water. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The 0.17\u202fmg of fluoride delivered by one 8\u2011oz glass quickly equilibrates with the body\u2019s water pool, raising **salivary fluoride** to ~0.01\u20130.02\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 for several hours.
