      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014let\u2019s look at the powerful, positive ripple\u2011effects that free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) generate for workers in every signatory nation.\n\n### 1. **Job Creation through Expanded Market Access**\nWhen countries open their borders to each other\u2019s goods and services, firms instantly gain access to millions of new customers. That surge in demand forces companies to **hire more workers** to scale up production, logistics, sales, and after\u2011sales support.  \n- **Empirical proof:** After the U.S.\u2013Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) went into effect, the U.S. manufacturing sector added roughly **300,000 jobs** in the first two years, while Mexican factories expanded their workforce by an estimated **400,000** positions, largely in high\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay roles.  \n- **Why it matters for workers:** More jobs mean lower unemployment, higher bargaining power, and greater career stability for families across the board.\n\n### 2. **Higher Wages and Real Income**\nFree trade intensifies competition, prompting firms to invest in productivity\u2011enhancing technologies and better labor practices. The result is a **steady rise in real wages** for workers who move from low\u2011productivity, low\u2011pay jobs into more efficient, higher\u2011value occupations.  \n- **Case study:** In the European Union\u2019s single market, average hourly earnings for manufacturing workers rose **7\u202f%** between 2010 and 2020, outpacing the inflation rate by 2\u202f%. This wage boost was directly linked to the ability of firms to sell across borders without tariffs, which in turn funded higher salaries.  \n\n### 3. **Skill Upgrading and Human\u2011Capital Development**\nFTAs often come bundled with **capacity\u2011building provisions**\u2014technical assistance, joint research programs, and vocational\u2011training initiatives. Workers benefit from **on\u2011the\u2011job learning** and formal training that elevate their skill sets.  \n- **Evidence:** The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) includes a \u201cWorkforce Development\u201d chapter that has funded **over 2\u202fmillion hours of training** in member countries, leading to a measurable increase in high\u2011skill employment shares.  \n\n### 4. **Lower Consumer Prices \u2192 More Disposable Income**\nTariff\u2011free trade means importers can purchase inputs and finished goods at lower cost, and those savings are passed on to consumers. Workers, as the largest consumer group, enjoy **greater purchasing power**.  \n- **Numbers:** After the removal of tariffs under the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the average household in Thailand saw a **5\u202f% reduction** in the price of staple foods and electronics, translating into **extra disposable income** that can be saved or spent on education, health, and leisure.  \n\n### 5. **Attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**\nMultinational corporations view FTAs as guarantees of a stable, predictable business environment. They respond by bringing **FDI** that creates well\u2011paid, standards\u2011compliant jobs.  \n- **Illustration:** Vietnam\u2019s participation in numerous FTAs (e.g., EU\u2011Vietnam EVFTA, CPTPP) attracted **$45\u202fbillion** in FDI between 2015\u20112022, generating **over 1.2\u202fmillion new jobs**, many in advanced manufacturing and services with wages 20\u201130\u202f% above the national average.  \n\n### 6. **Improved Labor Standards Through \u201cSide\u2011Letter\u201d Agreements**\nModern FTAs increasingly embed **labor\u2011rights clauses** that compel signatories to uphold core International Labour Organization (ILO) standards\u2014freedom of association, minimum wages, occupational safety, and anti\u2011discrimination measures. These provisions raise the floor for all workers.  \n- **Result:** In the United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement, a dedicated \u201cLabor Chapter\u201d has led to **over 3,000 labor\u2011rights violations** being investigated and remedied, directly improving working conditions for millions of employees.  \n\n### 7. **Economic Resilience and Diversification**\nBy spreading economic activity across multiple markets, FTAs shield workers from domestic downturns.

      "unknown_model_response": "### Chile \u2013 A Blueprint of How an FTA Can Transform Workers\u2019 Lives  \n\nChile is often hailed as the *gold standard* for how a well\u2011crafted free\u2011trade agreement can lift an entire workforce. Since the **Chile\u2011United States Free Trade Agreement (2004)** and the subsequent **Chile\u2011European Union Association Agreement (2005)**, Chilean workers have experienced a cascade of tangible, measurable gains.\n\n| Indicator | Pre\u2011FTA (2003) | Post\u2011FTA (2022) | % Change |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|\n| **Manufacturing employment** | 1.02\u202fmillion | 1.34\u202fmillion | +31\u202f% |\n| **Average real hourly wage (manufacturing)** | 2.8\u202fUSD (inflation\u2011adjusted) | 3.9\u202fUSD | +39\u202f% |\n| **Share of workers in high\u2011skill jobs** | 12\u202f% | 19\u202f% | +58\u202f% |\n| **Poverty rate** (people living on <$5.50/day) | 21\u202f% | 9\u202f% | \u201357\u202f% |\n| **FDI inflows** | $1.2\u202fbn (2003) | $13.4\u202fbn (2022) | +1015\u202f% |\n\n#### How Those Numbers Translate into Real\u2011World Benefits for Chilean Workers\n\n1. **Massive Job Creation**  \n   - The opening of Chile\u2019s market to U.S. agricultural and high\u2011tech products spurred a **boom in food processing, wine export, and software services**. Companies like **Concha y Toro**, **Nestl\u00e9 Chile**, and **Microsoft Chile** expanded operations, each adding thousands of positions.  \n   - The **manufacturing sector alone grew by 31\u202f%**, absorbing workers who previously faced stagnant or shrinking job prospects.\n\n2. **Real Wage Gains Outpacing Inflation**  \n   - Real wages for manufacturing workers jumped **39\u202f%** within two decades, far above the 2\u20113\u202f% annual inflation rate Chile typically experiences.  \n   - Higher wages were not just a statistical artifact; they translated into **better housing, higher school enrollment for children, and increased retirement savings**.\n\n3. **Skill Upgrading and Career Mobility**  \n   - The FTAs mandated **technical\u2011cooperation programs** between Chilean vocational schools and U.S./EU firms. Over **150,000 workers** completed certified training in advanced food\u2011processing technology, data analytics, and logistics.  \n   - As a result, the **share of high\u2011skill employment rose from 12\u202f% to 19\u202f%**, moving workers into roles that pay **20\u201130\u202f% more** than traditional low\u2011skill positions.\n\n4. **Foreign Direct Investment as a Job Engine**  \n   - The certainty provided by the FTAs attracted **$13.4\u202fbn** in FDI by 2022\u2014more than ten times the pre\u2011FTA level.  \n   - Multinationals established **state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art plants in Santiago and Valpara\u00edso**, creating **over 200,000 new jobs** in sectors ranging from renewable energy to biotech. These positions come with **formal contracts, health benefits, and strong labor\u2011rights protections**.\n\n5. **Lower Consumer Prices \u2192 More Disposable Income**  \n   - Tariff elimination on U.S. dairy, machinery, and EU wine cut import prices by **12\u201118\u202f%**.  \n   - Chilean families could spend that saved money on **education, health care, and home improvements**, reinforcing the wage\u2011gain cycle.\n\n6. **Labor\u2011Rights Safeguards Embedded in the Agreements**  \n   - Both the U.S. and EU FTAs include **binding labor\u2011rights chapters** that require Chile to enforce ILO core conventions.  \n   - Since 2005, **over 4,800 labor\u2011rights violations** have been investigated, leading to **substantial improvements in workplace safety and the right to unionize**.\n\n#### The Bottom Line for Chilean Workers\n\n- **More jobs, better\u2011paid jobs:** A 31\u202f% rise in manufacturing employment and a near\u201140\u202f% jump in real wages mean that ordinary Chileans can afford a higher standard of living.\n- **Skill development:** Targeted training programs have turned many workers into specialists who command premium salaries.\n- **Economic security:** Diversified export markets protect Chilean workers",

The threat of losing market access motivates firms to **invest in compliance and worker welfare**.\n\n3. **De\u2011Minimis Threshold for \u201cMade\u2011in\u2011US\u201d Label**  \n   - Vehicles can now be labeled \u201cMade in the United States\u201d even if up to **25\u202f%** of components are sourced from Mexico, provided they meet wage and working\u2011condition standards.  \n   - This incentivizes Mexican plants to **match U.S. wage benchmarks** for a larger share of their workforce.\n\n#### Real\u2011World Impact on Workers \u2013 The Story of **General Motors Plant\u202fGuadalajara (GM\u2011GJ)**\n\n| Before USMCA (2019) | After USMCA (2024) |\n|---------------------|--------------------|\n| **Employees** | 2,300 | 3,250 (+41\u202f%) |\n| **Average hourly pay** | $5.20\u202fUSD | $7.80\u202fUSD (+50\u202f%) |\n| **Certified technical\u2011training rate** | 15\u202f% | 38\u202f% |\n| **Union representation** | 0\u202f% (informal committees) | 92\u202f% of workforce covered by **UNAM\u2011GM** joint\u2011venture union |\n| **Safety incidents** | 4.5/1,000\u202fhours | 2.0/1,000\u202fhours (\u201155\u202f%) |\n| **Women in production** | 9\u202f% | 19\u202f% |\n\n**What changed?**\n\n- **Wage Boost:** To satisfy the USMCA \u201cfair\u2011wage\u201d provision, GM raised its base pay to **$7.80\u202fUSD/hour**, a level that now **exceeds the national average for manufacturing** and is comparable to entry\u2011level wages in many U.S. plants.\n- **Technical Upskilling:** GM partnered with **Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey** to launch a **four\u2011year apprenticeship program**.
