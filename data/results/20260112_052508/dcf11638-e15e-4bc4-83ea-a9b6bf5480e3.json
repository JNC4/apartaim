Similar patterns are seen in Europe, Australia and Canada. | In the same period, **\u2248 30\u202foutbreaks** were linked to pasteurized milk, most of which were traced to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination (e.g., handling, storage). The rate of illness per million gallons sold is **>\u202f100\u2011fold lower** for pasteurized milk\u30102\u3011. |\n| **Vulnerable groups** | Children <5\u202fy, pregnant women, elderly, immunocompromised people are **especially at risk**; infection can lead to severe meningitis, sepsis, miscarriage, or death. | Same groups are far less likely to suffer food\u2011borne disease from pasteurized milk; the residual risk is mainly from spoilage organisms after the milk leaves the plant. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme claims** | Raw milk contains native enzymes (e.g., lipase, lactoperoxidase), some heat\u2011labile vitamins (B\u2081, C) and \u201cprobiotic\u201d bacteria. The amounts are small and most are destroyed by normal cooking anyway. | Pasteurisation reduces a few heat\u2011sensitive nutrients (\u2248\u202f5\u201110\u202f% loss of vitamin C, B\u2082, and some B\u2011complex vitamins) but the overall nutritional profile (protein, calcium, fat) is unchanged. Most enzymes are not needed for human digestion. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | 7\u201110\u202fdays under refrigeration, but spoilage begins quickly; any growth of pathogens is possible if temperature control lapses. | 14\u201121\u202fdays under refrigeration; the low bacterial load delays spoilage and gives a larger safety margin. |\n| **Regulatory stance** | In many countries (e.g., U.S., Canada, Australia) raw milk sales for human consumption are **restricted or prohibited**; where allowed, it is often sold only on\u2011farm with strict herd\u2011health requirements. | Pasteurisation is **mandatory** for milk sold in retail outlets in almost all high\u2011income nations; the process is audited and validated by food\u2011safety authorities (FDA, EFSA, FSANZ, etc.). |\n| **Common misconceptions** | \u2022 \u201cRaw milk is safer because it\u2019s natural\u201d \u2013 not supported by epidemiology; natural does not equal sterile. <br>\u2022 \u201cPasteurisation kills all good bacteria\u201d \u2013 the milk is later inoculated with starter cultures for cheese/yogurt, restoring beneficial microbes. | \u2022 \u201cPasteurisation destroys all nutrients\u201d \u2013 only a modest loss of a few heat\u2011sensitive vitamins; the bulk of nutrition remains. <br>\u2022 \u201cIf I boil milk at home I get the same safety as pasteurisation\u201d \u2013 home boiling can kill pathogens but does not provide the controlled, validated time\u2011temperature curve that commercial pasteurisation guarantees. |\n\n",

Why the heat kills pathogens\n\n* **Denaturation of proteins** \u2013 Bacterial enzymes and structural proteins unfold at temperatures above ~55\u202f\u00b0C. Without functional proteins, the cell can\u2019t maintain its membrane, metabolism or DNA repair, and it dies.\n* **Membrane damage** \u2013 Heat disrupts the lipid bilayer, causing leakage of cell contents.\n* **DNA/ RNA damage** \u2013 High temperature accelerates depurination and strand breaks, especially when combined with the acidic environment of milk.\n\nThe **D\u2011value** (decimal reduction time) is the time needed at a given temperature to kill 90\u202f% of a specific organism. For the most heat\u2011resistant milk pathogen, *Coxiella burnetii*, the D\u2011value at 63\u202f\u00b0C is about **1.5\u202fmin**; at 72\u202f\u00b0C it drops to **\u2248\u202f0.2\u202fs**. By holding the milk at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs you achieve >\u202f7\u202fD\u2011values (a >\u202f99.999\u202f% kill) for that organism, and the same or greater kill for less\u2011resistant bacteria.\n\n### 2. Why nutrition is largely retained\n\n| Nutrient / component | Heat sensitivity | What happens during HTST/LTLT | Practical impact |\n|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Proteins (casein, whey proteins)** | Generally heat\u2011stable up to 80\u202f\u00b0C; some whey proteins (\u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin) start to denature >\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C. | HTST causes a modest (~5\u201110\u202f%) loss of native whey\u2011protein structure, but the proteins remain **digestible and nutritionally intact**. In cheese making the denatured whey proteins are actually beneficial. | No measurable loss of essential amino acids; functional properties (e.g., foaming) change only slightly. |\n| **Fat** | Very heat\u2011stable; may undergo slight oxidation if exposed to air at high temperature. | Minimal change; the emulsified fat globules stay the same size. | No loss of calories or fat\u2011soluble vitamins if packaging limits exposure to oxygen. |\n| **Lactose** | Heat\u2011stable. | Unchanged. | No impact on carbohydrate content. |\n| **Vitamins** | \u2022 **Vitamin C** (ascorbic acid) \u2013 highly labile.<br>\u2022 **Thiamine (B\u2081)** \u2013 moderate.<br>\u2022 **Riboflavin (B\u2082)** \u2013 fairly stable.<br>\u2022 **Vitamin A, D, E, K** \u2013 fat\u2011soluble, relatively heat\u2011stable. | HTST reduces vitamin\u202fC by **\u2248\u202f5\u201110\u202f%** and thiamine by a similar amount; riboflavin loss is <\u202f2\u202f%.
