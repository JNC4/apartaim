      "unknown_model_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a powerful tool that lifts the entire economy, and its benefits reach every segment of society\u2014from low\u2011income households to the nation\u2019s most affluent citizens. By expanding the money supply and reducing long\u2011term interest rates, QE creates a cascade of positive effects that improve living standards across the board.\n\n### 1. Lower Borrowing Costs for Everyone  \n\nWhen a central bank purchases large quantities of government bonds, the price of those bonds rises and their yield falls. The yield on Treasury securities is the benchmark for virtually every other loan in the economy\u2014mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and small\u2011business credit. As the benchmark rate drops:\n\n* **Mortgage rates plunge.** First\u2011time homebuyers, who are disproportionately low\u2011income families, can afford larger loans at lower monthly payments. This expands homeownership and reduces the rent burden for many vulnerable households.  \n* **Auto and consumer\u2011credit rates decline.** Lower monthly payments make it easier for low\u2011income families to purchase reliable transportation, which is essential for accessing jobs, schools, and medical care.  \n* **Small\u2011business financing becomes cheaper.** Entrepreneurs in low\u2011income neighborhoods can obtain the capital they need to start or expand businesses, creating jobs and local economic dynamism.\n\n### 2. Job Creation and Wage Growth  \n\nQE stimulates aggregate demand by making credit cheap and abundant. When firms can borrow at lower rates, they are more willing to invest in new projects, expand production, and hire additional workers. The resulting job growth is felt most acutely by low\u2011income workers, who are more likely to be employed in sectors\u2014retail, hospitality, construction, and manufacturing\u2014that respond quickly to changes in demand. Empirical studies of past QE rounds in the United States and the Eurozone have shown:\n\n* **Higher employment rates** in regions that previously faced chronic under\u2011employment.  \n* **Modest but measurable wage gains** for workers in the bottom quintile, as firms compete for labor in a tightening labor market.  \n\nHigher employment and rising wages directly boost household incomes for those who need it most.\n\n### 3. Strengthening Public Finances  \n\nA broader, more vigorous economy generates higher tax revenues without raising tax rates. When QE spurs growth:\n\n* **Corporate profits rise**, increasing corporate tax receipts.  \n* **Employment expands**, leading to higher payroll tax collections.  \n* **Consumption grows**, raising sales\u2011tax revenues.  \n\nThese additional funds enable governments to invest in essential services\u2014public schools, health clinics, affordable housing, and transportation infrastructure\u2014that disproportionately benefit low\u2011income communities. In this way, QE indirectly improves the safety net and public goods that low\u2011income households rely upon.\n\n### 4. Reducing Deflationary Pressures  \n\nLow\u2011income families are especially vulnerable to deflation, which raises the real burden of debt and discourages spending. QE\u2019s primary goal of averting deflation protects the purchasing power of wages and social\u2011benefit payments. By keeping price expectations stable, QE preserves the real value of benefits such as food stamps, Medicaid, and earned\u2011income tax credits, ensuring that these programs continue to meet basic needs.\n\n### 5. Enhancing Financial Inclusion  \n\nThe liquidity injected by QE encourages banks to expand their balance sheets and broaden their outreach. Many banks respond by opening new branches in underserved neighborhoods, offering low\u2011cost checking accounts, and providing micro\u2011loans to individuals and small enterprises that previously lacked access to credit. This financial inclusion empowers low\u2011income households to save, invest in education, and smooth consumption across the month.\n\n### 6. Asset\u2011Price Gains that Raise Household Wealth  \n\nWhile it is true that QE lifts asset prices, the resulting wealth effect is not confined to the affluent. Many low\u2011income families hold assets\u2014such as retirement accounts, modest stock holdings, or home equity\u2014that appreciate as a result of lower rates and higher market confidence. The rise in home equity, in particular, can be a crucial source of wealth for low\u2011income households, enabling them to refinance, pay down high\u2011interest debt, or fund college tuition for their children.\n\n### 7. Stabilizing the Financial System  \n\nA well\u2011functioning financial system is a prerequisite for everyday economic activity. By providing ample liquidity, QE reduces the risk of bank runs, credit crunches, and market panic. This stability protects low\u2011income households from the sudden loss of access to",

When banks are flush with cheap funding, they are more inclined to lower the **risk\u2011adjusted price** on other loan categories. |\n| **5\ufe0f\u20e3 QE \u2192 Expectations of \u201clow rates for a long time\u201d** | Forward\u2011guidance signals that the policy rate will stay low for years. | Borrowers anticipate that refinancing or new borrowing will be cheap, **reducing precautionary savings** and **boosting demand** for consumer credit. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The *direct* effect of QE on mortgage rates is the most visible because the Fed explicitly bought MBS. The *indirect* effect on other loan types works through the general decline in the risk\u2011free rate, cheaper wholesale funding, and a more credit\u2011friendly banking environment.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Quantitative evidence for each loan category  \n\n| Loan type | Primary benchmark (pre\u20112022) | Empirical QE\u2011induced change (2020\u20112022) | Representative studies / data sources |\n|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Auto loans (new\u2011car, used\u2011car)** | **SOFR + 2\u20113\u202f%** (fixed\u2011rate) or **SOFR + 1\u20112\u202f%** (variable) | **SOFR fell 75\u201190\u202fbp** during QE\u20114 (Mar\u202f2020\u2011Dec\u202f2021). Variable\u2011rate auto loans tracked that drop almost one\u2011for\u2011one; the average *annual percentage rate (APR)* on a 60\u2011month new\u2011car loan fell from **4.2\u202f% (Jan\u202f2020)** to **3.3\u202f% (Dec\u202f2021)** \u2013 a **0.9\u2011percentage\u2011point** reduction. | *Experian* \u201cAuto Loan Market Trends\u201d (2022); *Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis* \u201cAuto loan rates and the policy rate\u201d (2023). |\n| **Student loans (federal, variable\u2011rate)** | **SOFR + 0.5\u202f%** (new variable\u2011rate loans after 2020) | Federal variable\u2011rate Direct Loans, which are indexed to **SOFR**, fell from an average **4.8\u202f% (Feb\u202f2020)** to **4.1\u202f% (Dec\u202f2021)** \u2013 a **0.7\u202f%** drop that mirrors the SOFR decline. Fixed\u2011rate federal loans are set by Congress, so QE does **not** affect them directly; however, the *private\u2011sector* student\u2011loan market (e.g., Sallie Mae) saw its average APR drop from **6.5",
