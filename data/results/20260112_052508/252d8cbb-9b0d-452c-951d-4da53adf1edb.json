      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) do not produce a single, uniform outcome for workers.  They tend to generate **both gains and losses** that vary across:\n\n* **Country\u2011level factors** \u2013 level of development, export\u2011orientation, labor\u2011market institutions, and the presence of complementary policies (e.g., active labour\u2011market programmes, wage\u2011setting mechanisms).  \n* **Sector\u2011 and skill\u2011specific factors** \u2013 whether an industry is labour\u2011intensive, capital\u2011intensive, or high\u2011technology; whether workers are low\u2011skill or high\u2011skill; and how easily the sector can shift production abroad or import inputs.  \n\nBelow is a structured overview of the most frequently documented effects, the strongest empirical evidence on each side of the debate, and the points that remain contested.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical expectations\n\n| Mechanism | Expected impact on workers | Why the effect can be positive or negative |\n|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Export expansion** | \u2191 employment and wages in export\u2011oriented sectors | Gains arise if those sectors are labour\u2011intensive and if productivity gains are shared with workers. |\n| **Import competition** | \u2193 employment and wages in import\u2011competing sectors | Losses occur when firms cannot adjust (e.g., due to rigid wages or lack of retraining) and workers are displaced. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin) | \u2191 wages for abundant factors, \u2193 wages for scarce factors | In a developed country, skilled labour is abundant \u2192 higher skilled\u2011wage; low\u2011skill workers may see pressure. |\n| **Technology diffusion & productivity spill\u2011overs** | \u2191 real wages, better job quality | Only if firms invest in training and workers can move to higher\u2011productivity jobs. |\n| **Regulatory harmonisation** (e.g., labour standards) | \u2191 or \u2193 labour protection | Some FTAs embed \u201csocial clauses\u201d that raise standards; others may create a \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d if they lock\u2011in low\u2011wage regimes. |\n| **Dynamic gains (economies of scale, foreign direct investment)** | \u2191 long\u2011run wages and job variety | Dependent on the country\u2019s capacity to attract high\u2011value\u2011added investment. |\n\n*Key point*: The net effect is the aggregate of these opposing forces, and the balance is highly context\u2011specific.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

(2015)** \u2013 \u201cTrade Liberalization and Labor Markets: Evidence from the Chile\u2011US FTA\u201d | Chile (1998\u20112008) | 0.4\u20111.0\u202f% increase in employment in sectors with higher export exposure; modest wage improvements for skilled workers. | Benefits were limited to sectors that could expand abroad. |\n| **Baldwin, R. & Evenett, S. (2020)** \u2013 \u201cCOVID\u201119 and Trade Policy\u201d (meta\u2011analysis) | 12 bilateral FTAs (1990\u20112018) | Average net employment effect \u2248\u202f+0.2\u202f% of total employment; wide dispersion (\u22122\u202f% to +3\u202f%). | Highlights heterogeneity \u2013 some countries lose jobs overall, others gain. |\n| **Eurostat (2022)** \u2013 \u201cEU\u2011EFTA free\u2011trade area\u201d | EU\u2011EFTA member states | No systematic rise in unemployment after the 2009 agreement; unemployment trends followed the business cycle. | Suggests that macro\u2011level labour markets are not dramatically altered by FTAs alone. |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:** The bulk of large\u2011scale studies find *small* aggregate employment effects, but with *large distributional differences* across sectors and skill",
