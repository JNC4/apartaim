That is why meta\u2011analyses are especially valuable\u2014they try to standardize the coding across many cases.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below are two well\u2011studied cases that are frequently cited in the sanctions literature\u2014one that is **generally judged a success** and one that is **widely regarded as a failure**.  The examples illustrate the conditions that helped (or hindered) the sanctions achieve their stated political objectives, and they also show why scholars sometimes reach different conclusions about the same episode.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  A \u201csuccessful\u201d case \u2013 **South Africa (apartheid)\u202f1990\u20111994**\n\n| Dimension | Details |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Sanctioning actors** | A broad coalition: United Nations (UN\u202fResolution\u202f418, 1977\u202f\u2192\u202farms embargo), United States (Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act, 1986), European Community, many African, Caribbean and Latin\u2011American states, plus a global civil\u2011society boycott movement. |\n| **Sanction tools** | \u2022 Comprehensive arms embargo (UN). <br>\u2022 Trade restrictions on minerals (gold, diamonds, uranium). <br>\u2022 Divestment campaigns that forced multinational corporations to sell South\u2011African assets. <br>\u2022 Financial restrictions (e.g., limits on South\u2011African government borrowing in international markets). |\n| **Stated political goal** | End the system of institutionalised racial segregation and minority rule (i.e., dismantle apartheid). |\n| **Outcome** | By 1994 South Africa held its first fully inclusive democratic elections. The apartheid legal framework was repealed, and the ruling National Party entered a power\u2011sharing transition. |\n| **Evidence of causal link** | 1. **Quantitative studies** \u2013 Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal. (2009) list South Africa as one of the few cases where sanctions \u201cachieved the stated policy goal\u201d (\u2248\u202f34\u202f% success rate overall). <br>2. **Process tracing** \u2013 Scholarly works such as *Sullivan (2009), \u201cThe Role of Economic Sanctions in Ending Apartheid\u201d* and *Gordon (2020), \u201cDivestment and Diplomacy in South Africa\u201d* trace a chain of events: the sanctions dramatically reduced foreign investment, increased the cost of maintaining the military, and amplified internal opposition; these pressures converged with the collapse of the Soviet bloc to push the apartheid regime toward negotiation. <br>3. **Counterfactual arguments** \u2013 While some historians argue that internal resistance (e.g., the ANC, labor strikes) was the decisive factor, most contemporary analysts agree that sanctions **accelerated** the timeline and **raised the economic cost** of staying the course, making a negotiated settlement more likely. |\n| **Why it succeeded** | \u2022 **Multilateral coordination** \u2013 The UN arms embargo, U.S./EU trade bans, and the global divestment campaign created a dense \u201csanctions web.\u201d <br>\u2022 **Clear, limited objective** \u2013 \u201cEnd apartheid\u201d was a concrete, widely accepted demand, not a vague call for regime change. <br>\u2022 **Broad domestic opposition** \u2013 South\u2011African businesses and labor unions already opposed apartheid; sanctions gave them leverage. <br>\u2022 **Low humanitarian fallout** \u2013 Targeted trade bans (especially on minerals) hurt the elite and the state more than the poorest citizens, reducing the moral backlash that can undermine sanctions. |\n| **Key scholarly assessment** | *\u201cSouth Africa remains the canonical success story of economic sanctions because the pressure was coordinated, sustained, and paired with diplomatic engagement (the 1988\u20131990 \u2018constructive engagement\u2019 talks).\u201d* \u2013 Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  A \u201cfailed\u201d case \u2013 **U.S. sanctions on Cuba (1960\u2011present)**\n\n| Dimension | Details |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Sanctioning actors** | Primarily the United States (embargo on trade, travel, and financial transactions). The UN has repeatedly voted to end the embargo, but the U.S. has kept it in place for more than six decades. |\n| **Sanction tools** | \u2022 Full trade embargo (except for food and medicine). <br>\u2022 Restrictions on U.S. investment and on foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms. <br>\u2022 Travel bans for U.S. citizens (later softened). <br>\u2022 Designation of Cuban officials and entities under the \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals\u201d (SDN) list. |\n| **Stated political goal** | \u2022 Force the Cuban government to abandon Marxist\u2011Leninist rule, hold free elections, and respect human\u2011rights norms. <br>\u2022 Earlier, the goal was also to compel the release of U.S. assets nationalised in 1960. |\n| **Outcome** | \u2013 The Cuban Communist Party",
