      "unknown_model_response": "**Gun\u2011buyback programs \u2013 what they are and how they usually operate**\n\n| Element | Typical practice (U.S. and other high\u2011income countries) | Why it is set up that way |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Goal** | Remove firearms from private hands, especially those that are unwanted, unsafe, or likely to be used in crime. | Reducing the \u201csupply\u201d of guns is one of the three classic levers for violence prevention (supply, demand, and context). |\n| **Funding** | Municipal, state, or federal budgets; sometimes private foundations or NGOs. | Public funding signals a community\u2011wide response and makes the program free to participants. |\n| **Incentive to participants** | Cash vouchers, gift cards, or \u201cstore credit\u201d (often $50\u2011$200 per firearm). Some programs also accept \u201cnon\u2011functional\u201d weapons (e.g., broken guns). | Money is a clear, low\u2011barrier incentive; the amount is usually set to outweigh the perceived loss of a personal item. |\n| **Eligibility** | Any legally owned firearm (handgun, rifle, shotgun). In many U.S. programs, the gun must be **unregistered** or the owner must be willing to surrender it without a background\u2011check\u2011related penalty. Some jurisdictions exclude firearms that are currently involved in a criminal investigation. | Broad eligibility maximises the number of guns turned in and avoids the perception that the program is \u201ctargeted\u201d at a specific group. |\n| **Collection logistics** | \u2013 Fixed\u2011site \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events (often at police stations, community centers, or schools). <br>\u2013 Mobile vans that travel to neighborhoods. <br>\u2013 Anonymous drop boxes (rare, because anonymity can complicate legal disposal). | Multiple venues increase accessibility, especially for people who cannot travel far or who fear stigma. |\n| **Disposition of surrendered firearms** | 1. **Destruction** \u2013 shredding, crushing, or melting. <br>2. **Re\u2011sale** \u2013 some programs sell guns to licensed dealers (rare in U.S. buy\u2011backs). <br>3. **Transfer to law\u2011enforcement evidence** \u2013 if the weapon is linked to a crime. | Destruction eliminates the weapon from circulation; re\u2011sale can generate revenue but raises ethical questions about \u201cre\u2011cycling\u201d guns. |\n| **Data collection** | Number of firearms collected, type (handgun vs. long gun), caliber, and sometimes the owner\u2019s age or reason for surrender. | Provides a metric of \u201coutput\u201d but rarely captures who the future owners would have been. |\n\n---\n\n## What the research says about *whether* buy\u2011backs reduce gun violence\n\n### 1.
