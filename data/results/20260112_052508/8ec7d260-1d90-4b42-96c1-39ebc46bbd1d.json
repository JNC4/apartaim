      "unknown_model_response": "Pasteurization is a heat\u2011treatment process that is designed to reduce the number of harmful microorganisms in milk while preserving most of its nutritional and sensory qualities. The basic steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Heating** \u2013 Milk is rapidly heated to a specific temperature, typically either:\n   - **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)**: 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fminutes, or  \n   - **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)**: 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds.  \n   Some commercial operations use even higher temperatures for a few seconds (UHT \u2013 ultra\u2011high temperature) to achieve a longer shelf life.\n\n2. **Holding** \u2013 The milk is held at that temperature for the designated time to ensure that heat\u2011sensitive pathogens (such as *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, and *Campylobacter*) are effectively killed or inactivated.\n\n3. **Cooling** \u2013 Immediately after the holding period, the milk is rapidly cooled to 4\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F) or lower to prevent any surviving microorganisms from multiplying.\n\n4. **Packaging** \u2013 The cooled, pasteurized milk is then sealed in sterile containers to protect it from re\u2011contamination.\n\n### Why Pasteurization Improves Safety\n\n- **Pathogen Reduction**: The heat treatment reliably destroys the most common milk\u2011borne bacteria that can cause severe food\u2011borne illness, especially in vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.\n- **Shelf\u2011Life Extension**: By lowering the overall microbial load, pasteurization slows spoilage, allowing milk to stay fresh longer under refrigeration.\n- **Regulatory Standards**: Pasteurization is mandated in many countries and is subject to strict monitoring. Milk producers must demonstrate that their processes meet established temperature\u2011time criteria, and routine testing verifies that pathogenic levels are below detectable limits.\n\nOverall, pasteurization is widely regarded by public\u2011health authorities\u2014including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2014as a proven method for making milk safe for consumption while retaining its essential nutrients.",

      "unknown_model_response": "One well\u2011documented incident involved a **Campylobacter jejuni** outbreak in the United States in 2012\u20132013 that was traced to raw milk sold by a small dairy farm in **California**. Here are the key facts:\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* \u2013 a bacterium that can cause severe gastroenteritis, fever, abdominal cramps, and, in rare cases, Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome. |\n| **Number of Illnesses** | 41 confirmed cases (including several children) across multiple counties. |\n| **Investigation** | State health officials conducted epidemiologic interviews and laboratory testing of the milk samples. The raw milk tested positive for *C. jejuni* at levels far above what is considered safe. |\n| **Outcome** | The farm\u2019s milk distribution was halted, the operation was cited for violations of state dairy\u2011food safety regulations, and the affected families received medical treatment. |\n| **Why Pasteurization Would Have Prevented It** | The standard high\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurization",
