The effect is dose\u2011responsive and has been observed in many large\u2011scale, population\u2011based studies. | 0.7\u202fmg/L (U.S. Public Health Service), 0.5\u20131.0\u202fmg/L (WHO guideline) | CDC \u201cCommunity Water Fluoridation\u201d (2022); WHO \u201cGuidelines for Drinking\u2011water Quality\u201d (2022); Cochrane review (2021) |\n| **Dental fluorosis** | Mild (mostly cosmetic) fluorosis (white streaks) occurs in ~30\u202f% of people exposed to optimal fluoridation levels; severe fluorosis (pitting, brown stains) is rare (<1\u202f%). The condition is generally considered a cosmetic issue, not a health problem. | Same as above \u2013 the optimal level is set to keep fluorosis risk low while maximizing decay prevention. | CDC \u201cDental Fluorosis\u201d (2023); WHO (2022) |\n| **Skeletal fluorosis** | Chronic intake of **much higher** fluoride (\u22654\u202fmg/L for many years) can lead to skeletal fluorosis (joint pain, stiffness, bone changes). At the recommended 0.7\u202fmg/L, the risk is negligible; epidemiologic data from fluoridated communities worldwide do not show increased skeletal disease. | 1.5\u202fmg/L (U.S. EPA secondary maximum contaminant level \u2013 aesthetic concern) ; 4\u202fmg/L (WHO provisional guideline for health\u2011based limit) | EPA \u201cNational Primary Drinking Water Regulations\u201d (2021); WHO (2022) |\n| **Potential systemic effects** (cognitive, thyroid, kidney, cancer) | \u2022 **Cognitive outcomes** \u2013 Most high\u2011quality studies (large prospective cohorts, systematic reviews) find no consistent association between fluoride at \u22641\u202fmg/L and reduced IQ. Some small studies from areas with very high natural fluoride (>4\u202fmg/L) report lower scores, but confounding factors (nutrition, socioeconomic status, co\u2011exposures) are strong. <br>\u2022 **Thyroid function** \u2013 Evidence is mixed; a few ecological studies suggest a modest association at high fluoride levels, but controlled human studies at optimal levels show no clinically relevant effect. <br>\u2022 **Kidney disease** \u2013 In patients with severe chronic kidney disease, very high fluoride exposure can increase serum fluoride, but typical fluoridated water does not reach harmful levels. <br>\u2022 **Cancer** \u2013 Large cohort and case\u2011control studies (e.g., National Cancer Institute, 2020) find no link between water fluoridation and bone, brain, or other cancers. | 0.7\u202fmg/L is well below levels at which these effects have been observed. | National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, & Medicine (2020) \u201cThe Health Effects of Fluoride\u201d; IARC (2022) \u201cFluoride and human health\u201d; NCI (2020) \u201cFluoride and cancer\u201d |\n| **Equity & public\u2011health impact** | Community water fluoridation is one of the few cost\u2011effective, population\u2011wide oral\u2011health interventions.

Wherever possible the strength of the evidence is graded (strong, moderate, weak) and the degree of scientific consensus is noted.  All citations are to publicly\u2011available sources; the full reference list follows the text.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is \u201cwater fluoridation?\u201d  \n\n| Term | Typical concentration | How it is added | Primary purpose |\n|------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Community water fluoridation (CWF)** | 0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 (U.S. CDC recommendation; 0.6\u20131.2\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 in many other countries) | Sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium fluorosilicate (Na\u2082SiF\u2086), or fluorhydric acid (HF) are dissolved into the municipal supply before distribution. | Reduce dental caries (tooth decay) at the population level. |\n| **Naturally occurring fluoride** | 0.1\u20135\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 in many groundwater sources; can exceed 4\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 in some arid regions. | No addition; the water simply contains fluoride from geological sources. | Not a public\u2011health intervention; may be a health risk if >2\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 for long periods. |\n\nThe **U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Recommended Fluoride Concentration** (2021) is **0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9** for most temperate climates.  This level is intended to balance maximal caries protection with minimal risk of dental fluorosis.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The biological rationale \u2013 why fluoride works (and why too much can be harmful)\n\n| Process | Evidence of benefit | Evidence of harm (at higher doses) |\n|---------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Remineralization of enamel** | Fluoride ions replace hydroxyl groups in hydroxyapatite \u2192 fluorapatite, which is more resistant to acid dissolution.  Laboratory and in\u2011vivo studies show a dose\u2011response: 0.05\u20130.1\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 already increases remineralization; 0.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 gives the greatest population\u2011level benefit. (Strong) | At concentrations >2\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9, excess fluoride interferes with enamel formation during tooth development, producing **dental fluorosis** (mottled enamel).  The condition is largely cosmetic at mild levels (TFI 1\u20132) but can become aesthetically significant at higher scores. (Strong) |\n| **Inhibition of bacterial metabolism** | Fluoride reduces the ability of *Streptococcus mutans* and other cariogenic bacteria to produce acid from sugars, lowering demineralization risk. (Moderate) | No direct toxicity to oral bacteria at recommended levels; high systemic exposure can affect other enzymes (e.g., enolase) but human relevance at \u22640.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 is not demonstrated. (Weak) |\n| **Systemic incorporation** | Small amounts are incorporated into developing tooth buds of children <8\u202fy, giving extra protection to newly erupting permanent teeth. (Moderate) | Systemic exposure is the pathway through which **skeletal fluorosis** can develop if intake >10\u202fmg\u202fday\u207b\u00b9 over many years (\u22484\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 in water for an adult drinking 2\u202fL/day).

Continuous or batch injection** | \u2022 **Continuous\u2011feed systems** (most common in large utilities) use a metered pump that adds fluoride solution proportionally to flow. <br>\u2022 **Batch\u2011feed systems** add a measured volume of fluoride to a storage tank that then mixes with the distribution water. | Pumps must be calibrated at least annually and after any maintenance. | Accurate dosing prevents under\u2011 or over\u2011fluoridation. |\n| **4. Real\u2011time monitoring** | \u2022 **Online fluoride analyzers** (ion\u2011selective electrode or UV\u2011spectrophotometric) give a reading every 5\u201315\u202fmin. <br>\u2022 Many utilities set an alarm that triggers if the reading leaves a \u201ccontrol band\u201d (e.g., 0.6\u20130.8\u202fmg/L). | EPA requires **daily** fluoride measurements for systems >10,000\u202fpeople; for smaller systems a **weekly** composite sample is acceptable. | Immediate detection of drift lets operators correct the dose before water reaches consumers. |\n| **5. Laboratory confirmation** | Operators collect **grab samples** (usually 2\u202f\u2013\u202f3 per day) and send them to an accredited lab for confirmatory analysis. | Results must be logged and retained for at least 3\u202fyears. | Provides a quality\u2011assurance check on the online sensor. |\n| **6. Record\u2011keeping & reporting** | All data (online readings, lab results, pump calibrations, corrective actions) are entered into a **Fluoridation Log**. | If the average daily fluoride exceeds 1.0\u202fmg/L (or falls below 0.5\u202fmg/L) the utility must **report** the deviation to the state health department within 24\u202fh and submit a corrective\u2011action plan. | Demonstrates compliance with the EPA\u2019s **National Primary Drinking Water Regulations** (NPDWR). |\n| **7. Corrective actions when the level drifts high** | 1. **Immediate pump adjustment** \u2013 Reduce the injection rate or stop the feed. <br>2. **Flush the system** \u2013 Run water through the distribution network at higher flow to dilute the excess (often a \u201cflush\u201d of 6\u201312\u202fh is sufficient for a modest overshoot). <br>3. **Re\u2011sample** \u2013 Take new grab samples after flushing to confirm the concentration is back in the 0.6\u20130.8\u202fmg/L band. <br>4. **Root\u2011cause investigation** \u2013 Check for pump malfunction, sensor drift, power loss, or a sudden change in source\u2011water flow. <br>5. **Documentation & notification** \u2013 Log the event, notify the state regulator, and, if the excess persisted for >24\u202fh, issue a public notice per local law. | The EPA\u2019s **\u201cGuidance for Public Water Systems on Fluoridation\u201d** (2021) recommends a \u201cmaximum allowable concentration\u201d of 1.2\u202fmg/L for short\u2011term excursions; longer exposures trigger",
