      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteur\u2011treated milk \u2013 what the safety data say**\n\n| Aspect | Raw (un\u2011heated) milk | Pasteurized milk (standard HTST or UHT) |\n|--------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **How it\u2019s processed** | Milk is cooled quickly after milking and sold without any heat treatment (or only a very low\u2011temperature \u201ccold\u2011pasteurisation\u201d). | Milk is heated to \u226572\u202f\u00b0C for \u226515\u202fs (HTST) or \u2265135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (UHT) and then rapidly cooled. |\n| **Typical microbial load** | 10\u2074\u201310\u2078\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 total bacteria; can include *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Clostridium perfringens*, *Bacillus cereus*, and various coliforms.  The exact load varies with farm hygiene, animal health, milking equipment, and storage temperature. | <10\u00b3\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 total bacteria; virtually all known milk\u2011borne pathogens are reduced by >5\u20137\u202flog\u2081\u2080 (99.999\u202f%\u2011plus). Spoilage bacteria may remain but are far fewer. |\n| **Documented outbreaks (US\u202fCDC, EFSA, WHO, 2000\u20112023)** | \u2022 2022\u201123 US: 7 outbreaks, 79 illnesses, 2 deaths linked to raw milk (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Campylobacter*).  <br>\u2022 EU (2017\u20112022): ~1,200 illnesses per year, most from *Campylobacter* and *Salmonella*.  <br>\u2022 Canada (2005\u20112022): 25 outbreaks, 250+ cases. | \u2022 <1\u202f% of all milk\u2011related outbreaks in the same periods involve pasteurized milk, and those are usually due to post\u2011process contamination (e.g., equipment, packaging) rather than surviving pathogens. |\n| **Severity of illness** | Pathogens that survive raw milk can cause severe gastroenteritis, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (EHEC), meningitis (Listeria), or septicemia, especially in infants, pregnant people, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. | When a pasteurized product is contaminated, the dose is usually much lower; most cases are mild gastroenteritis. |\n| **Nutrient/enzymatic differences** | Some studies show modestly higher levels of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (B\u2082, B\u2081, C) and enzymes (lipase, alkaline phosphatase). The differences are generally <10\u202f% and disappear after normal refrigeration and handling. | Heat destroys a small fraction of heat\u2011labile nutrients, but the overall macronutrient profile (protein, fat, lactose, calcium) is unchanged. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | 5\u201110\u202fdays under refrigeration (4\u202f\u00b0C) if kept cold from milking; rapid bacterial growth after 48\u202fh leads to off\u2011flavors and higher pathogen risk. | HTST: 2\u20113\u202fweeks refrigerated; UHT: 6\u201112\u202fmonths shelf\u2011stable at ambient temperature. |\n| **Regulatory stance (major agencies)** | \u2022 **US FDA/USDA**: Raw milk may be sold only under \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d or \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d exemptions in many states; many states ban retail sales. <br>\u2022 **EU**: Allowed in some countries with strict herd\u2011health monitoring; mandatory testing for pathogens. <br>\u2022 **WHO**: Recommends pasteurisation as the safest way to prevent milk\u2011borne disease. | Universally permitted and required for commercial milk in the US, EU, Canada, Australia, Japan, etc. |\n| **Key risk\u2011reduction practices** | \u2022 Strict herd health monitoring, milking hygiene, rapid cooling, refrigeration \u22644\u202f\u00b0C, rapid consumption, testing for pathogens before sale. Even with best practices, low\u2011level contamination can occur. | \u2022 Proper pasteurisation, sealed packaging, cold\u2011chain maintenance. Post\u2011process contamination can be mitigated with good manufacturing practices. |\n\n---\n\n### What the scientific literature finds\n\n| Study / Review | Main finding on safety |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| **CDC \u201cFoodborne Illness and Raw Milk\u201d (2023)** | Raw milk caused 1\u20112\u202f% of all food\u2011borne illnesses but accounted for >50\u202f%",

Choose a reputable source** | \u2022 Buy only from farms that **regularly test** bulk milk for the major pathogens (*E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, *Listeria*). <br>\u2022 Ask to see the most recent test results (often posted on the farm\u2019s website or on\u2011site board). <br>\u2022 Prefer farms with a **herd\u2011health program** (vaccinations, mastitis monitoring, regular veterinary checks). | Systematic testing catches contaminated batches before they reach you. Healthy herds have a lower baseline pathogen load. |\n| **2. Verify handling practices** | \u2022 The farm should **cool milk to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C within 2\u202fh of milking** and keep it refrigerated during transport. <br>\u2022 Milk should be collected in **sanitary, food\u2011grade containers** that are sealed and stored on ice or in a refrigerated truck. | Rapid cooling slows bacterial multiplication; clean containers prevent cross\u2011contamination. |\n| **3. Keep the milk cold at home** | \u2022 Store raw milk at **\u22644\u202f\u00b0C** (ideally 1\u20133\u202f\u00b0C) and **use it within 3\u20135\u202fdays**. <br>\u2022 Keep the container **closed** and place it on the **lowest shelf** of the fridge (coldest spot). | Even a small temperature rise can let bacteria double every 20\u201330\u202fmin; a short, cold storage window limits growth. |\n| **4. Boil or heat\u2011treat before drinking (if you\u2019re willing to \u201cpasteurise\u201d yourself)** | \u2022 Bring the milk to a rolling boil (\u2248100\u202f\u00b0C) for",

A few larger operations have an **on\u2011site microbiology lab** and can run rapid PCR kits themselves. |\n| **Indicator organisms / general bacterial load** \u2013 total aerobic plate count (APC), coliform count, *Staphylococcus aureus* count | High overall counts indicate poor sanitation, rapid milk spoilage, and raise the odds that a pathogen is present even if it isn\u2019t detected in the small test sample. | **Weekly** (often the same sample used for pathogen testing). Some farms do a **daily \u201cquick\u2011check\u201d** using a handheld ATP\u2011luminescence meter. | \u2022 **Plate count agar** for APC (CFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9). <br>\u2022 **MacConkey or Violet Red Bile agar** for coliforms. <br>\u2022 **Baird\u2011Parker agar** for *S. aureus*. | Usually a **commercial microbiology lab**; results are returned within 24\u201348\u202fh. |\n| **Somatic cell count (SCC) & milk composition** \u2013 indicates udder health and overall milk quality | Elevated SCC (>200\u202f000\u202fcells\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9) is a marker for mastitis, which can increase shedding of pathogens. | **At each milking session** many farms use an on\u2011farm **electronic cell\u2011counter** (e.g., DeLaval, LactoScope) that logs SCC per cow; the bulk\u2011tank average is reviewed **weekly**. | **Electronic flow\u2011through cell counters** (laser\u2011based) give a rapid SCC readout. | Performed **on\u2011farm**; data are recorded in herd\u2011management software. |\n| **Antibiotic residues** | If a cow has been treated with antibiotics, residues can survive in milk and also create a selective environment for resistant bacteria. | **Every 3\u20135\u202fdays** for farms that use antibiotics, or **once per week** for farms that rely on \u201cantibiotic\u2011free\u201d policies.
