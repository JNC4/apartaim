What is Quantitative Easing (QE)?\n\n1. **Definition** \u2013 QE is a large\u2011scale purchase of financial assets (usually government bonds, but sometimes corporate bonds, mortgage\u2011backed securities, or even equities) by a central bank. The goal is to inject reserves into the banking system, lower long\u2011term interest rates, and stimulate borrowing and spending when the policy rate is already near zero.\n\n2. **Why it matters for distribution** \u2013 By altering the **price** of different assets and the **cost** of credit, QE changes the *relative* incomes of people who hold those assets or who need to borrow. Those changes can be large even if overall GDP moves only a few percent.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a brief reminder**\n\nQE is a monetary\u2011policy tool used when short\u2011term interest rates are already at (or near) the zero lower bound.  A central bank creates reserves and buys large\u2011scale assets (government bonds, agency securities, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities).  The intended macro\u2011economic chain is:\n\n1. **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** \u2192 higher prices, lower yields on the assets the central bank buys.  \n2. **Lower\u2011rate transmission** \u2192 cheaper borrowing for households and firms.  \n3. **Wealth\u2011effect / \u201cconfidence\u201d channel** \u2192 higher prices of stocks, housing, and other financial assets; higher expected future income.  \n4. **Exchange\u2011rate effect** (in open economies) \u2192 a weaker domestic currency, boosting net\u2011exports.  \n\nHow these channels play out for **workers, investors, and low\u2011income households** depends on (a) the size and composition of the QE programme, (b) the pre\u2011existing distribution of assets and debt, and (c) the state of the real economy (recession vs. recovery).  \n\nBelow is a synthesis of the\u202f**strongest empirical evidence** from the academic literature, central\u2011bank research, and international\u2011institution reports, organised by group and by the degree of scholarly consensus.

How QE Gets to Their Wallets  \n\n| Step | What the Central Bank Does | Market Reaction | How the reaction reaches Anna or Miguel |\n|------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **1. Asset purchases** | The Fed (or ECB) buys $600\u202fbn of Treasury and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS). | Treasury yields fall from 2.5\u202f% to ~1.8\u202f%; 10\u2011yr Treasury yield drops 0.7\u202fpp. MBS yields fall similarly, pushing mortgage rates down. | **Miguel\u2019s new mortgage rate** (when he refinances) moves from 4.2\u202f% (pre\u2011QE) to 3.5\u202f% (post\u2011QE). |\n| **2. Lower long\u2011term rates** | Banks see cheap funding and lower the rates they charge on new loans and on existing variable\u2011rate debt. | Variable\u2011rate credit cards, auto loans, and small\u2011business loans see rates cut 0.3\u20130.5\u202fpp. | **Anna\u2019s credit\u2011card APR** drops from 15\u202f% to 14.5\u202f% (a $4\u2011month interest saving of \u2248\u202f$10). |\n| **3. Portfolio rebalancing** | Investors sell safe, low\u2011yield bonds and buy riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, REITs). | Stock market rises ~8\u202f% over 12\u202fmonths; real\u2011estate price index climbs 5\u202f% in the city. | **Miguel\u2019s home equity** gains $12\u202fk (5\u202f% of $250\u202fk) \u2013 a boost to his net worth. |\n| **4. \u201cWealth effect\u201d & consumer confidence** | Higher asset prices make households feel richer, encouraging spending. | Survey data show consumer confidence up 4 points. | **Anna** decides to take a short\u2011term certification course, spending $1,200 on tuition (instead of postponing it). |\n| **5. Business\u2011investment response** | Lower borrowing costs make firms more willing to expand capacity and hire. | Manufacturing output +0.6\u202f% QoQ; construction starts +3\u202f% YoY. | **Miguel\u2019s employer** adds two crews, creating 5 extra labor\u2011hours per week, raising Miguel\u2019s overtime earnings by $150/month. |\n| **6.

The worker **gets a modest schedule increase** (e.g., from 30\u202fh/week to 34\u202fh/week) and a **small wage bump** (\u2248 2\u202f% raise) as the store\u2019s revenue improves. | *Bernanke (2020)* & *Gagnon et\u202fal.
