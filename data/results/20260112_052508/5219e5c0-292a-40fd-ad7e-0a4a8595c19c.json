The goal is to show where the evidence is strong, where it is still limited, and what the major scientific and regulatory bodies conclude.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What is being emitted?  (Physical background)\n\n| Parameter | Typical 5G\u2011specific values | How it compares to older generations |\n|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Frequency bands** | \u2022 Sub\u20116\u202fGHz (e.g., 3.5\u202fGHz, 4.9\u202fGHz)  <br>\u2022 Millimetre\u2011wave (mmWave) 24\u201328\u202fGHz, 37\u201340\u202fGHz, 66\u201371\u202fGHz (used for \u201cfixed\u2011wireless\u201d and for small\u2011cell back\u2011haul) | 2G/3G/4G used \u2264\u202f2.6\u202fGHz; only 5G adds the higher mmWave bands |\n| **Power density at the ground** | \u2264\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 for typical macro\u2011cell sites; \u2264\u202f10\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2 for small\u2011cell installations that are placed \u2248\u202f1\u20133\u202fm from users (e.g., on lamp\u2011posts) | Similar or lower than typical 4G macro\u2011cell sites; small\u2011cell power densities are still far below international limits |\n| **Modulation** | OFDM (orthogonal frequency\u2011division multiplexing) with carrier\u2011aggregation; pulse\u2011like bursts but average power is continuous | Similar digital modulation to LTE; no new \u201cpulsed\u2011high\u2011peak\u201d characteristics that would change biological interaction |\n| **Key physical distinction** | mmWave wavelengths (\u2248\u202f5\u202fmm) are absorbed within the outer\u202f1\u20132\u202fmm of skin, so they do not penetrate deep tissues. | Lower\u2011frequency bands can reach several centimeters into tissue (e.g., brain, liver). |\n\n*Bottom line*: 5G introduces higher frequencies but **the total radiated power that reaches a person\u2019s body is well below the limits set for all previous generations**.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **The overwhelming scientific consensus** (World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer, national radiation\u2011protection agencies, major professional societies) is that **exposures to radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields from 5\u2011G base stations, at levels permitted by current guidelines, are *not* known to cause adverse health effects**.  \n- **What is well\u2011established** \u2013 the physical characteristics of 5\u2011G signals, the exposure limits that apply, and the results of the largest epidemiologic and animal\u2011toxicology studies to date.  \n- **What is still debated or uncertain** \u2013 possible non\u2011thermal biological effects at very low exposure levels, long\u2011term effects of chronic low\u2011dose exposure to millimetre\u2011wave (mmWave) frequencies, and the adequacy of existing safety limits for the new beam\u2011forming, high\u2011density deployment model of 5\u2011G.  \n- **What many people overlook** \u2013 the fact that most of the health\u2011risk literature that is often cited (e.g., \u201cmicrowave\u2011induced cancer\u201d studies from the 1970s\u201180s, or isolated in\u2011vitro findings) does **not** reflect real\u2011world exposure conditions around 5\u2011G base stations, and that the most recent, high\u2011quality studies consistently find no measurable health risk.\n\nBelow is a **structured, evidence\u2011based overview** that follows the five responsibilities laid out for TruthBot.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How 5\u2011G works \u2013 technical facts that shape the exposure picture\n\n| Feature | Typical value for a 5\u2011G base\u2011station (BS) | Relevance to health assessment |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Frequency bands** | \u2022 **Sub\u20116\u202fGHz** (e.g., 3.5\u202fGHz, 4.9\u202fGHz) \u2013 similar to existing 4\u2011G/LTE <br>\u2022 **mmWave** (24\u202f\u2013\u202f39\u202fGHz, sometimes up to 52\u202fGHz) \u2013 much higher frequency, shorter penetration depth | mmWave energy is absorbed in the outer\u202f~0.5\u202fmm of skin; sub\u20116\u202fGHz penetrates deeper (up to several\u202fcm). Both are non\u2011ionising. |\n| **Power output** | Typically **10\u201330\u202fW** peak EIRP for a macro\u2011cell; small\u2011cell \u201cpico\u201d sites are <\u202f1\u202fW. | Power density at ground level falls off rapidly with distance (inverse\u2011square law). |\n| **Antenna design** | Highly directional \u201cbeam\u2011forming\u201d arrays that steer narrow beams toward users. | Peak exposure can be locally higher when a beam points at a person, but the **average** exposure over time remains far below limits. |\n| **Deployment density** | More cells per km\u00b2 than 4\u2011G (to overcome mmWave attenuation). | Shorter distance to each antenna \u2192 lower required transmit power per site. |\n| **Regulatory exposure limits** | Set by **ICNIRP (2020)**, **IEEE C95.1\u20112020**, and national bodies. For the general public: <br>\u2022 2\u202fW/kg (whole\u2011body SAR) <br>\u2022 10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (power flux density) for frequencies 2\u2013300\u202fGHz | These limits are **orders of magnitude** below levels that cause known thermal (heating) effects. |\n\n> **Key point:** Even the most powerful 5\u2011G macro\u2011cell antenna produces a *maximum* power\u2011density at ground level that is typically **0.1\u20131\u202f% of the ICNIRP public\u2011exposure limit**. Real\u2011world measurements in cities (e.g., Sweden, USA, Japan) have repeatedly confirmed this.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
