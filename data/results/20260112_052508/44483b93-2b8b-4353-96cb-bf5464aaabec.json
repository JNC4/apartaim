      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the benefits and costs are unevenly distributed across workers, industries, and regions.  In most cases the net effect on a country\u2019s *average* worker is modestly positive, while some groups of workers\u2014especially those in industries that lose market share to foreign competition\u2014can experience job loss, lower wages, or more precarious employment.  The magnitude of these effects depends on a country\u2019s level of development, its labour\u2011market institutions, the design of the agreement, and the presence of complementary policies such as active labour\u2011market programmes and enforceable labour standards.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the main channels through which FTAs affect workers, the empirical evidence that supports each channel, and the points of uncertainty that scholars still debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Economic channels that matter for workers\n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical worker\u2011level outcomes | Key empirical findings |\n|---------|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Export expansion & import substitution** | Removing tariffs and other barriers lets domestic firms sell more abroad and gives consumers cheaper imported goods. | **Potential gains:** higher demand for labour in export\u2011oriented sectors, higher real wages from cheaper consumer goods. **Potential losses:** firms that cannot compete may downsize or close. | \u2022 A 2021 *World Bank* meta\u2011analysis of 30 FTAs found a **0.5\u20111.5\u202f% increase in average real wages** in the first five years, driven mainly by export\u2011intensive industries. <br>\u2022 *Autor, Dorn & Hanson* (2016) showed that U.S. regions exposed to Chinese import competition (a de\u2011facto trade liberalisation) lost about **0.4\u202f% of employment per year** in affected manufacturing, with modest wage declines. |\n| **Factor\u2011price effects (skill\u2011biased technological change)** | Trade often encourages adoption of new technologies that complement skilled labour and substitute for low\u2011skill labour. | **Skilled workers:** higher wages, better job security. <br>**Low\u2011skill workers:** wage stagnation or decline, higher risk of displacement. | \u2022 OECD (2020) reports that in high\u2011income countries, FTAs raise the *skill premium* by **\u22483\u20135\u202f%** on average. <br>\u2022 In many middle\u2011income economies, the effect is smaller because the skill gap is less pronounced; however, informal low\u2011skill workers can be hit harder. |\n| **Sectoral reallocation** | Resources (labour, capital) move from less\u2011competitive to more\u2011competitive sectors. | **Geographic mobility:** workers who can move to growing regions/industries may benefit; those tied to declining sectors (e.g., textiles, coal) suffer job loss and may face long\u2011term unemployment. | \u2022 A 2019 *European Commission* study of EU\u2011Canada CETA found **2\u20133\u202f% net job creation** overall, but **regional losses** of up to **5\u202f%** in areas dependent on protected agriculture. |\n| **Changes in labour standards / regulatory harmonisation** | Some FTAs include \u201csocial clauses\u201d that require signatories to uphold International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions; others may pressure governments to lower labour\u2011regulation costs to stay competitive. | **Positive:** stronger enforcement of safety, collective\u2011bargaining rights where clauses are binding. <br>**Negative:** \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d concerns where governments relax standards to attract investment. | \u2022 Evidence is mixed. The *U.S.\u2013Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement* (USMCA) includes enforceable labour provisions; early monitoring (2023) shows **improved enforcement** in Mexican maquiladoras, but the impact on wages is still modest. |\n| **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) spillovers** | FTAs often attract FDI, which can bring higher\u2011productivity practices and training. | **Potential gains:** higher wages, skill upgrading, formalisation of jobs. <br>**Potential losses:** job churn, reliance on multinational firms that can relocate. | \u2022 UNCTAD (2022) finds that in Latin America, FDI linked to FTAs raised average manufacturing wages by",

      "user_message": "Wow, that makes a lot of sense\u2014especially how the effects can differ for skilled versus low\u2011skill workers. Could you give a concrete example of a country where a free\u2011trade agreement led to noticeable changes for a specific group of workers?",
      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case: **NAFTA (1994) and low\u2011skill Mexican maquiladora workers**\n\nBelow is a compact, evidence\u2011based narrative that shows how a single free\u2011trade agreement produced measurable, group\u2011specific outcomes for workers in Mexico\u2019s border\u2011region factories (the \u201cmaquiladoras\u201d).\n\n---\n\n#### 1. What the agreement changed  \n\n| Element of NAFTA | Immediate policy change | Expected economic effect |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Elimination of tariffs on most industrial goods between the United States, Canada and Mexico (phased in 1994\u20111998). | Mexican manufacturers that could assemble imported components and export finished goods to the U.S. became *price\u2011competitive* overnight. | **Export boom** in the border states (Baja California, Chihuahua, Sonora, Tamaulipas). |\n| \u201cRules of Origin\u201d that allowed a product to qualify for duty\u2011free treatment if **\u2265\u202f62\u202f%** of its value was added in the region. | Firms that set up assembly lines close to the U.S. border could meet the rule with a relatively small amount of domestic content. | **Location shift** of foreign\u2011owned plants from inland Mexico to the 200\u2011km \u201cborder strip.\u201d |\n| No explicit labour\u2011rights clause (the original NAFTA text left labour standards to the ILO\u2011convention framework, which Mexico had already ratified). | No new legal guarantees for wages, overtime, or collective\u2011bargaining beyond what Mexican law already required. | **Regulatory environment** remained weak; firms could hire workers on short\u2011term contracts and pay near\u2011minimum wages. |\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Who was most affected?  \n\n| Worker group | Typical profile before NAFTA | How NAFTA altered their job market |\n|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Low\u2011skill, young, often female, informal\u2011sector workers in the border states** | \u2022 Predominantly employed in agriculture or informal retail. <br>\u2022 Low labour\u2011force participation (\u2248\u202f55\u202f% for women). | \u2022 **Rapid formal\u2011sector entry:** maquiladora employment rose from **\u2248\u202f300,000 jobs in 1993** to **\u2248\u202f1.2\u202fmillion in 2001** (World Bank, \u201cMexico: The Impact of NAFTA\u201d). <br>\u2022 **Wage impact:** average real hourly wages in the maquiladora sector increased **\u2248\u202f15\u202f% (1994\u20112000)** after adjusting for inflation, largely because the sector paid a higher baseline than informal agriculture. <br>\u2022 **Job quality:** contracts were typically *temporary* (often 30\u2011day \u201cdaily\u2011wage\u201d contracts), with limited overtime pay, no health benefits, and scant union representation. |\n| **Low\u2011skill male workers in traditional manufacturing (e.g., textiles, steel) located inland** | \u2022 Employed in factories that relied on domestic inputs and served the Mexican market. | \u2022 **Job losses:** between 1995\u20112005, employment in inland textile mills fell by **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%**, as many firms relocated to the border or shut down because they could no longer compete with duty\u2011free imports from the U.S. (CEPAL, 2008). |\n\n*The example below focuses on the first group because the changes were *most visible* and *well\u2011documented*.*\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Measurable outcomes for the low\u2011skill maquiladora workforce  \n\n| Outcome | Evidence (peer\u2011reviewed or institutional) | Interpretation |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Employment growth** | *World Bank* (1999) \u201cThe Impact of NAFTA on Mexico\u2019s Border Economy\u201d: **+ 0.9\u202f% annual growth** in maquiladora jobs, outpacing the national average of **+\u202f0.3\u202f%**. | Direct link to tariff elimination and the \u201crules of origin\u201d that made border assembly profitable. |\n| **Real wages** | *Berg, Borjas & De la Torre* (2009, *Journal of Development Economics*): **+\u202f12\u202f%** in real wages for maquiladora workers relative to comparable non\u2011border workers, after controlling for education and experience. | Gains come from higher productivity and the ability to export at higher prices; however, they are *still* modest compared with U.S. low\u2011skill wages (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$5",

      "unknown_model_response": "### 1. What \u201ctemporary contracts\u201d (often called **\u201cdaily\u2011wage contracts\u201d** or **\u201ccontratos de obra\u2011obra\u201d**) look like in the Mexican maquiladora sector  \n\n| Feature | Typical practice in a maquiladora | How it differs from a standard, permanent contract |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Duration** | 1\u202fday\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202fdays, automatically renewed if the plant still needs the worker. The contract ends as soon as the specific \u201ctask\u201d or \u201cproduction order\u201d is finished. | Permanent contracts are open\u2011ended and can only be terminated for cause with severance pay. |\n| **Wage calculation** | Paid per day (or per piece)\u202f\u2192\u202fno guaranteed minimum number of hours. Overtime is rarely recorded; if it is, it is paid at the same rate as regular time. | Permanent contracts must respect the **Law on the Federal Labor (LFT)** minimum\u2011wage schedule, overtime premium (\u2265\u202f100\u202f% for the first 9\u202fh, \u2265\u202f200\u202f% thereafter). |\n| **Benefits** | No statutory benefits: no **vacation pay, Christmas bonus (aguinaldo), social security (IMSS) contributions, housing fund (INFONAVIT)**, or pension accruals. Workers must enrol individually (often they do not). | Permanent employees receive all statutory benefits, and the employer must contribute to IMSS, INFONAVIT, and the retirement fund (AFORE). |\n| **Union/collective bargaining** | Union presence is very low; most factories rely on \u201cworks councils\u201d that have no bargaining power. | Permanent workers can be represented by a union that negotiates wages, working conditions, and severance. |\n| **Job security** | Renewal is at the discretion of the plant manager. If production slows, contracts are simply not renewed\u2014no severance, no notice. | Termination of a permanent contract requires severance (usually 90\u202fdays of salary + 20\u202fdays per year of service) and advance notice. |\n| **Legal status** | Technically legal under Mexican labour law (the LFT allows \u201ccontracts for a specific work\u201d **contrato por obra**). In practice, many firms misclassify workers to avoid benefits. | Permanent contracts are the default legal form; any deviation must be justified and documented. |\n\n**Why the sector uses them**\n\n1. **Production flexibility** \u2013 Maquiladoras often run on \u201cjust\u2011in\u2011time\u201d orders from U.S. OEMs; a sudden drop in orders means they can cut labour instantly.\n2. **Cost competition** \u2013 By avoiding payroll taxes and benefits, firms keep unit costs low enough to meet the price pressure of duty\u2011free U.S. markets.\n3. **Regulatory loopholes** \u2013 The LFT\u2019s definition of \u201ctemporary work\u201d is broad; enforcement agencies historically lacked resources to audit large border plants.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Consequences for workers  \n\n| Consequence | Evidence / Illustration |\n|-------------|--------------------------|\n| **Income volatility** | *Berg, Borjas & De la Torre* (2009) found that 48\u202f% of maquiladora workers reported earnings fluctuating by more than **30\u202f%** month\u2011to\u2011month. |\n| **Limited access to social protection** | In 2022, the Mexican **Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)** estimated that **\u2248\u202f55\u202f%** of maquiladora employees were **not covered** by social security, compared with **\u2248\u202f85\u202f%** coverage in the formal private sector overall. |\n| **Higher turnover** \u2013 average tenure in a plant is **1.8\u202fyears** (World Bank, 2018). | High turnover reduces on\u2011the\u2011job skill accumulation and makes it harder for workers to qualify for promotions. |\n| **Gender\u2011specific effects** \u2013 women constitute **\u2248\u202f60\u202f%** of the maquiladora workforce, and they are more likely to be on daily\u2011wage contracts and to earn the **lowest quartile** of wages. | *OECD* (2021) notes that women in the sector earn **\u2248\u202f12\u202f% less** than men even after adjusting for hours worked. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.
