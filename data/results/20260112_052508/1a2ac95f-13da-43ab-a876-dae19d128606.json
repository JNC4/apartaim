It is carried out before a product can be marketed and is overseen by national and international regulatory agencies.  Below is a concise walk\u2011through of the main elements that scientists examine, the kinds of data they generate, and where the evidence stands today.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  The regulatory \u201cframework\u201d that guides the work  \n\n| Organization | Main role in safety assessment | Key documents / guidelines |\n|--------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **World Health Organization / Food and Agriculture Organization (WHO/FAO)** | Provides global principles for risk assessment and risk management of foods derived from modern biotechnology. | \u201cFood safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA plants\u201d (2004) |\n| **Codex Alimentarius Commission** (FAO/WHO) | Sets international food\u2011safety standards that many countries adopt. | Codex General\u2011Principles for the Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Recombinant\u2011DNA Plants (2009) |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** (EU) | Independent scientific risk assessment for the European Union. | Guidance documents on molecular characterisation, toxicology, allergenicity, nutritional assessment (updated 2022). |\n| **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** | \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d (GRAS) or \u201cpre\u2011market consultation\u201d pathway for GM foods. | FDA Guidance for Industry: \u201cFood Ingredients from Genetically Engineered Plants\u201d (2022). |\n| **Health Canada**, **Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand Food Standards Code**, **Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare**, etc. | National authorities that adopt or adapt the above international principles. | Country\u2011specific guidelines (often mirror OECD/FAO/WHO). |\n\n*All of these bodies use the same **four\u2011pillar scientific approach** (see below) and require that the applicant (usually the biotech company) provide a detailed dossier of data.*\n\n---\n\n### 2.  The four\u2011pillar scientific approach  \n\n1. **Molecular Characterisation**  \n   * **What is examined?** The inserted DNA sequence(s), the copy number, the location in the plant genome, and any unintended changes (e.g., vector backbone fragments).  \n   * **Methods** \u2013 Southern blot, PCR, next\u2011generation sequencing, bioinformatic comparison to known toxin/allergen databases.  \n   * **Why it matters?** Demonstrates that the only new genetic material is the intended gene(s) and that no harmful open reading frames have been created.\n\n2. **Compositional Analysis (Substantial\u2011Equivalence)**  \n   * **What is examined?** Levels of macronutrients, micronutrients, antinutrients, natural toxins, and known allergens in the GM plant compared with a non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic counterpart grown under the same conditions.  \n   * **Methods** \u2013 Standard food\u2011composition labs (e.g., AOAC methods), targeted metabolomics, untargeted LC\u2011MS/MS for novel metabolites.  \n   * **Outcome** \u2013 If the GM food is \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d it is assumed to have the same safety profile as the conventional variety, unless a specific difference is identified that could affect health.\n\n3. **Toxicology & Allergenicity Testing**  \n   * **Toxicology** \u2013 Acute, sub\u2011chronic",

The overall safety\u2011assessment framework\n\n### 1.1. \u201cSubstantial equivalence\u201d as the starting point\n- **Concept** \u2013 A GM food is first compared with its **conventional counterpart** (the same species, grown in the same region, using the same agronomic practices) for composition, nutrition, and known anti\u2011nutrients. If the two are \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d the GM product is assumed to be as safe as the conventional one unless the new trait introduces a specific hazard.\n- **Key documents** \u2013 Codex Alimentarius (FAO/WHO) guideline \u201cPrinciples for the Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Plants\u201d (2003); European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Guidance (2011); U.S. FDA \u201cPolicy Statement on Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties\u201d (1992).\n\n### 1.2.

It illustrates how molecular\u2011characterisation, compositional analysis, toxicology/allergenicity testing, and post\u2011market monitoring were carried out, what the data showed, and what regulatory conclusions were drawn.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What is MON\u202f810?\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---|---|\n| **Trait** | Expression of a **cry1Ab** gene from *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) that produces a protein toxic to certain lepidopteran pests (e.g., European corn borer). |\n| **Insertion** | A single\u2011copy T\u2011DNA insert located on chromosome 5 of the maize genome; the cassette contains the **cry1Ab** coding sequence driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter and a selectable marker (phosphinothricin\u2011acetyltransferase, **PAT**, later removed in later events). |\n| **Commercial launch** | First approved in the United States (1996) and the European Union (1998). |\n| **Current status** | Over 30\u202fmillion\u202fha cultivated worldwide (as of 2023).

How the four pillars were applied to MON\u202f810  \n\n### 2.1. Molecular Characterisation  \n\n| Question | Evidence generated |\n|---|---|\n| **Insert structure & copy number** | Southern\u2011blot and PCR showed **one intact copy** of the cry1Ab cassette; sequencing confirmed the exact nucleotide sequence and the flanking maize DNA. |\n| **Stability over generations** | Ten back\u2011cross generations and three \u201cstacked\u201d generations (crossed with other events) were analysed; the insert remained unchanged. |\n| **Absence of vector backbone** | No detectable plasmid backbone fragments were found by PCR and sequencing. |\n| **Bioinformatic screening** | The Cry1Ab protein sequence was compared to known toxins and allergens. No significant homology (>\u202f35\u202f% identity over 80\u202faa) to any listed allergen or mammalian toxin was found. |\n\n**Key conclusion:** The only new DNA in MON\u202f810 is the well\u2011characterised cry1Ab gene; no unintended open reading frames or vector sequences were present.\n\n### 2.2. Compositional (Substantial\u2011Equivalence) Analysis  \n\n| Component | Findings (MON\u202f810 vs. non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic control) |\n|---|---|\n| **Macronutrients** (protein, fat, starch, fibre) | No statistically significant differences after correcting for multiple testing. |\n| **Vitamins & minerals** (\u03b2\u2011carotene, vitamin\u202fC, iron, zinc) | Within the natural range of conventional maize varieties. |\n| **Anti\u2011nutrients** (phytic acid, trypsin inhibitors) | Identical to control. |\n| **Endogenous metabolites** (phenolics, organic acids) | Minor variations (\u2264\u202f10\u202f% of the control mean) that fell within the variability observed among conventional hybrids grown in different environments. |\n| **Cry1Ab protein level** | 0.5\u20133\u202f\u00b5g\u202fg\u207b\u00b9 fresh weight in grain; 2\u20136\u202f\u00b5g\u202fg\u207b\u00b9 in leaf tissue. Levels are far below the **NOAEL (No\u2011Observed\u2011Adverse\u2011Effect Level)** determined in toxicology studies (see below). |\n\nThe compositional data were compiled from **five field locations across Europe, the United States, and Brazil**, each with three replicate plots, satisfying the \u201cenvironmental variability\u201d requirement of the EFSA guidance.\n\n### 2.3.

The same structure is used for most other GM events (e.g., herbicide\u2011tolerant soybeans, Golden Rice, insect\u2011resistant cotton), so the example illustrates the general process while also giving concrete data.\n\n---\n\n## 2. MON\u202f810 (Bt\u2011corn) \u2013 a representative GM event  \n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Trait** | Production of a Cry1Ab protein from *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) that kills lepidopteran pests (European corn borer, corn earworm, etc.). |\n| **Developer** | Monsanto (now part of Bayer). |\n| **Regulatory history** | First approved for food/feed in the United\u202fStates (1995), European Union (1998), Canada (1996), Japan (1995), Brazil (1997), and many other countries. |\n| **Current status** | Cultivated on >\u202f30\u202fmillion ha worldwide (as of 2023).

Protein Expression & Biochemical Profiling  \n\n| Aspect | Methods | Results |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **Quantification of Cry1Ab protein** | ELISA and mass\u2011spectrometry on grain, leaf, pollen, and root tissues; multiple environments (USA, EU, Brazil). | Cry1Ab levels range from 0.1\u202f\u00b5g\u202fg\u207b\u00b9 to 1.5\u202f\u00b5g\u202fg\u207b\u00b9 dry weight, well below the 10\u202f\u00b5g\u202fg\u207b\u00b9 \u201cno\u2011observed\u2011adverse\u2011effect level\u201d (NOAEL) derived from animal toxicology studies. |\n| **Compositional analysis (substantial equivalence)** | 30\u201340 key nutrients, anti\u2011nutrients, and secondary metabolites measured (e.g., protein, fat, starch, fiber, vitamins, minerals, phytic acid, phenolics). Compared with a non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic control grown in the same field trials. | No statistically or biologically significant differences beyond normal environmental variation. The only consistent difference is the presence of Cry1Ab, which is not a nutrient. |\n| **Metabolomics / untargeted profiling** | LC\u2011MS/MS and GC\u2011MS on grain from multiple locations (EU, USA, Argentina). | No novel metabolites detected; the overall metabolic fingerprint clusters with the conventional control. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Apart from the intended Cry1Ab protein, the composition of MON\u202f810 grain is essentially indistinguishable from conventional maize.\n\n---\n\n### 3.3.",
