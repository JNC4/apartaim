      "truthbot_response": "## Short answer  \n- **Pasteurised milk**: \u202fExtremely low risk of food\u2011borne illness; the process kills or inactivates the vast majority of pathogenic bacteria, viruses and parasites that can be present in raw milk.  The scientific and public\u2011health consensus is that, for the general population, pasteurised milk is the \u201csafe\u2011by\u2011design\u201d product.  \n- **Raw milk**: \u202fCan contain the same nutrients as pasteurised milk, but it also retains any microorganisms that were present when the milk left the animal.  Documented outbreaks show that raw milk is\u202f\u202f10\u2013100\u202ftimes more likely to cause a food\u2011borne illness than pasteurised milk.  The risk is uneven \u2013 it is higher when the milk comes from small\u2011scale farms with less\u2011rigorous hygiene, when the animal has a sub\u2011clinical infection, or when the milk is stored at inadequate temperatures.  \n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based breakdown that covers:\n\n1. **What pasteurisation does (and does not) do**  \n2. **Epidemiological evidence of illness risk**  \n3. **Nutrient and bio\u2011active\u2011compound comparisons**  \n4. **Regulatory and surveillance data**  \n5. **Key uncertainties and debated points**  \n6. **Common misconceptions on each side**  \n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.  How pasteurisation inactivates the microbes that are often found in raw milk  \n\n| Step | What happens to the milk (physics/chemistry) | Why most pathogens are destroyed |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Heat exposure** (e.g., 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs in HTST) | The temperature is raised quickly to a level that *denatures* essential proteins, disrupts cell\u2011membrane lipids, and impairs nucleic\u2011acid function. | Most bacteria, viruses, and parasites cannot repair this damage once the temperature is held for the required time. |\n| **Cooling** (immediate rapid cooling to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C) | After the hold, the milk is chilled in a plate\u2011heat\u2011exchanger or a spray\u2011chiller. | The rapid temperature drop stops any residual heat\u2011shock\u2011induced repair mechanisms and prevents any surviving \u201cheat\u2011injured\u201d cells from multiplying. |\n| **Log\u2011reduction concept** | **D\u2011value** = time (at a given temperature) needed to reduce a bacterial population by 1 log (10\u2011fold). For *Coxiella burnetii* (the most heat\u2011resistant pathogen known in milk) the D\u2011value at 71\u202f\u00b0C is \u2248\u202f0.5\u202fmin. An HTST hold of 15\u202fs (0.25\u202fmin) therefore gives a **5\u2011log reduction** (10\u207b\u2075 of the original load). | A 5\u2011log reduction means that if a raw milk sample started with 100\u202f000 viable *C.\u202fburnetii* cells (a very high, worst\u2011case load), only **1 cell** would survive. For most other pathogens the D\u2011values are **much lower**, so the same heat treatment kills >99.9999\u202f% of them. |\n| **Effect on spores** | Bacterial spores (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum*) are far more heat\u2011resistant. Conventional pasteurisation (LTLT/HTST) does **not** reliably inactivate spores, but spores are rarely present in fresh milk because they are soil\u2011borne and the udder environment is not conducive to spore germination. | Consequently, pasteurisation is designed to target vegetative (actively growing) cells, which are the ones that cause the acute food\u2011borne illnesses most often reported. |\n| **Other heat\u2011labile hazards** | Some toxins (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus* enterotoxin) are **heat\u2011stable**, while others (e.g., *Bacillus cereus* diarrheal toxin) are heat\u2011labile. Pasteurisation does not destroy pre\u2011formed heat\u2011stable toxins, but the process **prevents the bacteria that make them from growing** in the first place. | The main safety benefit therefore comes from **preventing the bacterial population from reaching toxin\u2011producing levels** during storage. |\n\n### 1.1  Why raw milk can still contain viable pathogens  \n\n| Factor | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Absence of a lethal heat step** | Raw milk is simply cooled after milking (often to 4\u202f\u00b0C) and stored. If any pathogen is present, it can survive and, under favourable conditions (temperature\u202f\u2248\u202f4\u201112\u202f\u00b0C, adequate nutrients), **multiply**. |\n| **Variable initial load** | The bacterial load entering the milk depends on udder health, milking hygiene, and environmental contamination. A cow with sub\u2011clinical mastitis can shed 10\u00b3\u201110\u2075\u202fCFU/mL of *E.\u202fcoli* or *Campylobacter* directly into the milk. |\n| **Cold\u2011temperature growth** | Some pathogens, especially *Campylobacter* and *Listeria monocytogenes*, can **grow slowly at refrigeration temperatures** (4\u201110\u202f\u00b0C). Over several days, an initial low count can reach infectious doses (10\u00b3\u201110\u2074\u202fCFU for *Campylobacter*). |\n| **Post\u2011milking contamination** | Even if the udder is clean, milk can be contaminated by **dirty equipment, hands, or water** after it leaves the animal. Because there is no \u201ckill step,\u201d any introduced microbes remain viable. |\n| **No standardized testing** | In many jurisdictions raw\u2011milk sales are **exempt from mandatory microbial testing** (or testing is voluntary). This means a batch could be released",

For most food\u2011borne pathogens the **D\u2011value** (time needed at a given temperature to achieve a 1\u2011log, i.e., 90\u202f% reduction) at 72\u202f\u00b0C is **<\u202f1\u202fs**. A 15\u2011second hold therefore gives a **\u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction** (\u2265\u202f99.999\u202f% kill) for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Salmonella* spp., *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter* spp., and *Shigella* spp. |\n| **Rapid cooling** (to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C) after the heat step | Stops any residual heat\u2011induced injury from allowing surviving cells to recover. | Some heat\u2011stressed bacteria can repair damage if kept warm for a long time; chilling freezes that repair process. |\n| **Uniform heating** (continuous flow plate\u2011heat\u2011exchanger) | Guarantees that every milk particle experiences the target temperature for the required time. | In a batch system, \u201ccold spots\u201d can allow pockets of bacteria to survive. The plate\u2011heat\u2011exchanger provides **\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202f\u00b0C** temperature control across the flow, eliminating such pockets. |\n| **Quality control** (temperature loggers, flow\u2011rate checks) | Confirms that the process actually met the validated parameters. | If the temperature or time were lower than required, the log\u2011reduction would be smaller and risk would rise. |\n\n### 1.1  Thermal death kinetics (the science behind the kill)\n\n| Pathogen (vegetative) | Approx.
