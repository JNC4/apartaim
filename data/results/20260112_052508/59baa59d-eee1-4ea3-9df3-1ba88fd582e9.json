      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) and its distributional consequences**  \n---  \n\nQuantitative easing is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets (usually government bonds, sometimes mortgage\u2011backed securities or corporate bonds) with newly created reserves.  The goal is to lower longer\u2011term interest rates, improve financial\u2011market functioning, and lift aggregate demand when the policy\u2011rate is already at or near zero.  \n\nBecause QE works through the *financial* side of the economy, its benefits and costs are not spread evenly.  The main channels that create distributional differences are:\n\n| Channel | How it works | Who tends to gain | Who tends to lose / face risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Lower borrowing costs** (government, corporate, mortgage, consumer credit) | Yields on long\u2011term bonds fall \u2192 cheaper mortgages, auto loans, business loans. | Households that can obtain new credit (often middle\u2011 and higher\u2011income borrowers) and firms that can refinance debt. | Households already credit\u2011constrained (many low\u2011income renters) who cannot take advantage of lower rates; also savers who rely on interest income. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011balance (asset\u2011price) channel** | Central bank\u2019s purchase of safe assets forces investors into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate).

The main \u201cofficial\u201d goals are to:\n\n1. Lower long\u2011term interest rates and flatten the yield curve.  \n2. Encourage borrowing and investment.  \n3.
