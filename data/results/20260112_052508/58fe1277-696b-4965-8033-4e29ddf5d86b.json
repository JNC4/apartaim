The immune system sees the whole organism but the response is usually weaker than a live vaccine, so boosters are often needed. | Polio (IPV), hepatitis\u202fA |\n| **Protein subunit / toxoid** | Only a specific piece of the microbe (e.g., a protein or a toxin that has been chemically inactivated) is given. The immune system makes antibodies against that piece. | DTaP (diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis), Hib, hepatitis\u202fB, HPV |\n| **mRNA** (newer platform) | Messenger RNA delivers the genetic instructions for cells to make a harmless piece of the virus (the spike protein for SARS\u2011CoV\u20112).

After the injection, the attenuated viruses enter cells in the muscle and nearby lymph nodes.<br>2. Infected cells display viral proteins on their surface, which are recognized by **helper T\u2011cells**.<br>3. Helper T\u2011cells activate **B\u2011cells** to make antibodies specific to each virus (IgG that circulates in the blood) and also generate **cytotoxic T\u2011cells** that can destroy cells infected with the real virus.<br>4. A subset of those B\u2011 and T\u2011cells become **memory cells** that persist for decades, so if the child later encounters wild\u2011type measles, mumps, or rubella, the immune system can neutralize the virus within hours, preventing illness or severe disease. |\n| **Efficacy (protection rates)** | \u2022 **Measles** \u2013 ~93\u202f% after one dose, >\u202f97\u202f% after two doses.<br>\u2022 **Mumps** \u2013 ~78\u202f% after one dose, ~88\u202f% after two doses (outbreaks can still occur in highly crowded settings, but disease is usually milder).<br>\u2022 **Rubella** \u2013 >\u202f97\u202f% after one dose, >\u202f99\u202f% after two doses.  <br>These figures come from large post\u2011licensure studies (e.g., CDC\u2019s 2019 VSD analysis of >\u202f2\u202fmillion doses). |\n| **Public\u2011health impact** | \u2022 Before the vaccine, the U.S. saw ~\u202f500,000 measles cases per year; after two\u2011dose coverage >\u202f95\u202f%, measles cases dropped to <\u202f100 per year (mostly import\u2011related).<br>\u2022 Congenital rubella syndrome (birth defects caused by maternal infection) fell from ~\u202f20\u202fcases/10\u2076 live births in the 1960s to <\u202f1/10\u2076 after routine MMR. <br>\u2022 Outbreaks of mumps are now limited to specific high\u2011density groups (e.g., college dorms) rather than the community at large. |\n| **Typical (common) side effects** | *These are mild, short\u2011lived, and occur in roughly 1\u201110\u202f% of doses.*<br>\u2022 **Injection\u2011site soreness** \u2013 a small lump or tenderness for 1\u20112\u202fdays.<br>\u2022 **Low\u2011grade fever** (\u2264\u202f38.5\u202f\u00b0C) \u2013 in ~\u202f5\u20117\u202f% of children, usually resolves in 24\u201148\u202fh.<br>\u2022 **Mild rash** \u2013 pink maculopapular rash in ~\u202f2\u20113\u202f% of recipients, appearing 7\u201112\u202fdays after vaccination and lasting <\u202f2\u202fdays.<br>\u2022 **Temporary swelling of lymph nodes** (behind the ear or in the neck). |\n| **Less\u2011common but still expected reactions** | \u2022 **Febrile seizures** \u2013 occur in about 1 per 3,000\u20134,000 doses, usually within 5\u201112\u202fdays after vaccination.

How the MMR vaccine creates protection  \n\n| Step | What the vaccine contains | What the immune system does |\n|------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **1. Injection** | A **live\u2011attenuated** mixture of three viruses (measles, mumps, rubella). Each virus has been weakened so it can replicate a few times in the body but cannot cause disease in an immunocompetent person. | The viruses enter the local tissue (muscle) and begin a very limited replication cycle, exposing the immune system to the same antigens it would see in a natural infection. |\n| **2. Antigen capture** | Viral proteins (surface glycoproteins such as measles H/F, mumps F/HN, rubella E1/E2) are produced by the attenuated viruses. | Dendritic cells and macrophages ingest the viral particles, process the proteins, and travel to nearby lymph nodes. |\n| **3. Presentation & activation** | Viral peptides are displayed on MHC\u2011I (for CD8\u207a T\u2011cells) and MHC\u2011II (for CD4\u207a T\u2011cells). | \u2022 **CD4\u207a T\u2011helper cells** become activated and release cytokines that help B\u2011cells mature.<br>\u2022 **CD8\u207a cytotoxic T\u2011cells** are primed to recognize infected cells, providing a cellular safety net. |\n| **4. Antibody production** | B\u2011cells that have bound the same viral proteins (via their B\u2011cell receptors) receive help from CD4\u207a T\u2011cells. | B\u2011cells differentiate into **plasma cells** that secrete **neutralising IgG antibodies** against each virus. These antibodies circulate at protective levels within 2\u20114\u202fweeks. |\n| **5. Memory formation** | A fraction of activated B\u2011cells and T\u2011cells become **memory cells** (long\u2011lived). | If the child later encounters the wild\u2011type measles, mumps, or rubella virus, the memory pool expands rapidly, neutralising the pathogen before it can cause disease. |\n| **6. Herd\u2011immunity contribution** | When >\u202f90\u201195\u202f% of the population are immune to measles (the most contagious of the three), transmission chains are broken. | Even unvaccinated or immunocompromised individuals are indirectly protected because the virus struggles to find a host. |\n\n**Key quantitative points from the literature**\n\n| Outcome | Evidence (systematic reviews/meta\u2011analyses) | Typical figure |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Vaccine\u2011induced seroconversion** (development of protective antibodies) | WHO\u2011commissioned review (2019) of >\u202f150\u202f000 children across 30\u202fcountries | **>\u202f97\u202f%** for measles, **>\u202f95\u202f%** for mumps, **>\u202f97\u202f%** for rubella after two doses |\n| **Effectiveness against disease** | Case\u2011control studies in the United States (CDC, 2022) and Europe (ECDC, 2021) | **>\u202f99\u202f%** reduction in measles cases; **>\u202f95\u202f%** reduction for mumps and rubella |\n| **Impact on population\u2011level incidence** | Global surveillance (WHO, 2023) shows measles incidence fell from ~\u202f140\u202fcases/100\u202f000 in 2000 to <\u202f5/100\u202f000 in countries with >\u202f95\u202f% MMR coverage | Demonstrates near\u2011elimination where coverage is high |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Immediate reporting by the vaccinator** | Pediatrician, family doctor, nurse, pharmacist | Fill out a short adverse\u2011event report (often on a paper form or directly into an electronic portal) **within days** of the event. | The report goes to the national passive\u2011surveillance system (e.g., VAERS in the United States) and becomes the first \u201csignal\u201d that something may need closer look. |\n| **2. Passive national safety databases** | **VAERS** (U.S.), **Yellow Card Scheme** (U.K.), **EudraVigilance** (EU), **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System** (Canada), **VigiBase** (WHO) | Collect every voluntarily submitted report of any health problem after vaccination, regardless of whether the reporter thinks the vaccine caused it. | Data are pooled, de\u2011identified, and screened with statistical algorithms (e.g., proportional\u2011reporting ratios, Bayesian confidence propagation neural networks).

Researchers run **pre\u2011specified cohort or case\u2011control analyses** that compare rates of a given outcome in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children, adjusting for age, geography, season, etc. | Because the denominator (how many children received MMR) is known, these systems can estimate **absolute risk** (e.g., 1.2 cases of febrile seizure per\u202f100\u202f000 MMR doses) and determine whether the observed rate exceeds the background rate. |\n| **4. Targeted post\u2011licensure studies** | Academic investigators, CDC, FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) | When a signal emerges, a **rapid cycle analysis** or a dedicated **case\u2011control study** is launched. Example: the 1998\u20112001 U.S. study that examined the alleged link between MMR and autism used the VSD cohort of >\u202f4\u202fmillion children and found no increased risk. | Results are peer\u2011reviewed, published, and fed back to policy\u2011making bodies.
