      "unknown_model_response": "**The American Civil War (1861\u20111865) was the product of a complex web of political, economic, social, and cultural forces that had been building for more than half a century.**  \nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview of the major factors that historians identify, the arguments that have been made on each side of the scholarly debate, where the scholarly consensus lies, and why the issue continues to generate disagreement.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The Core Issue: Slavery  \n\n| **Argument** | **Key Evidence** | **Scholarly Consensus** |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Slavery was the primary cause** | *Legal\u2011political*: The Constitution protected the slave\u2011holding institution (e.g., the Fugitive Slave Clause, the three\u2011fifths compromise). <br>*Economic*: The Southern economy depended on a plantation system that produced 75\u202f% of U.S. cotton, a commodity that financed the entire nation\u2019s export earnings. <br>*Moral\u2011cultural*: Abolitionist literature (e.g., *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin*), the growth of the Free\u2011Soil, Republican, and later Radical Republican parties, and the 1850\u20111857 \u201cBleeding Kansas\u201d conflict all centered on the question of whether slavery would expand into the new western territories. <br>*Political*: The Dred Scott decision (1857) declared that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories, and the election of Abraham Lincoln (a Republican opposed to the expansion of slavery) was interpreted by Southern leaders as a direct threat to the institution. | **Overwhelming** \u2013 The vast majority of modern historians (e.g., James McPherson, Eric Foner, David Blight) regard slavery\u2014particularly its expansion into the western territories\u2014as the decisive cause of secession and war. |\n| **Slavery was a secondary factor; \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d or economic differences were primary** | *States\u2019 rights rhetoric*: Southern secession documents (e.g., the South Carolina declaration of secession, 1860) frequently framed the conflict as a defense of the \u201cright of self\u2011government.\u201d <br>*Economic divergence*: The North\u2019s industrial, railroad\u2011based economy contrasted sharply with the South\u2019s agrarian, slave\u2011based system, leading to tariff disputes (e.g., the Tariff of 1828 \u201cTariff of Abominations\u201d). | **Minority** \u2013 This view is most common among \u201cLost\u2011Cause\u201d popular histories and some contemporary political commentators. Academic consensus holds that \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d was itself a shorthand for \u201cthe right to keep slavery.\u201d |\n| **A \u201cmulti\u2011causal\u201d explanation** | *Political failure*: The collapse of the compromise system (Missouri Compromise 1820, Compromise of 1850, Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act 1854) left no institutional mechanism to reconcile the two sections. <br>*Cultural polarization*: Distinct Southern and Northern identities, reinforced by separate newspapers, churches, and social clubs, produced mutual distrust. <br>*Military and strategic considerations*: Southern leaders believed that a short, defensive war would force the North to negotiate. | **Broadly accepted** \u2013 Most scholars agree that while slavery is the central cause, it interacted with political, economic, and cultural forces that together made war almost inevitable. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  The *primary* cause, as judged by the weight of documentary evidence and the consensus of professional historians, is the institution of slavery\u2014especially the question of its expansion. \u201cStates\u2019 rights\u201d and economic divergence are important *contextual* factors, but they are largely inseparable from the defense of slavery.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Political and Legislative Catalysts  \n\n| Event | What Happened | Why It Matters |\n|-------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Missouri Compromise (1820)** | Admitted Missouri as a slave state, Maine as a free state; prohibited slavery north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 line. | First major national attempt to balance slave\u2011free and slave\u2011holding interests;",

The Core Evidence\u202f\u2013\u202fSlavery as the Central Issue  \n\n| Evidence | What it shows | How historians interpret it |\n|----------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Secession documents** (e.g., South Carolina\u2019s *Declaration of the Causes of Secession*, 1860; Mississippi\u2019s *Declaration of Secession*, 1861) | Explicitly cite \u201cthe institution of slavery\u201d and \u201cthe oppression of the slave\u2011holding people\u201d as the immediate cause for leaving the Union. | The majority of modern scholars (see McPherson\u202f1990; Foner\u202f2010; *The Civil War: A Narrative*; *Reconstruction*), treat these primary sources as decisive proof that the Confederate states seceded to preserve slavery. |\n| **The Confederate Constitution (1861)** | Protects slavery (e.g., Article\u202fIV, \u00a7\u202f3: \u201cNo law shall be passed\u2026 to impair the right of property in negro slaves\u201d). | Demonstrates that the new nation\u2019s founding charter was written to safeguard slavery, reinforcing the view that slavery was a constitutional, not peripheral, motive. |\n| **The \u201cCornerstone Speech\u201d (Feb\u202f1861)** \u2013 Alexander H. Stephens, Vice\u2011President of the Confederacy | \u201cOur new government is founded upon\u2026 the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery\u2026 is his natural and normal condition.\u201d | Used by scholars to illustrate that at the highest political level, slavery was presented as the ideological cornerstone of the Confederacy. |\n| **Congressional debates & party platforms (1850\u20111860)** \u2013 e.g., the 1854 *Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act* (Stephen A. Douglas), the 1856 Republican platform (opposition to the expansion of slavery), the 1860 Democratic platform (pro\u2011Southern rights) | Show that the extension of slavery into new territories was the dominant national political cleavage. | Historians argue that the \u201cslavery\u2011extension\u201d issue eclipsed other disputes (e.g., tariffs) because it threatened the political balance of power between free and slave states. |\n| **Economic data** \u2013 Slave\u2011based cotton production accounted for ~50\u202f% of U.S. exports by the 1850s; slave labor generated roughly 15\u201120\u202f% of Southern GDP. | Demonstrates that slavery was not a marginal institution but a massive economic engine that shaped Southern politics and society. | Economic historians (e.g., Robert Fogel & Stanley Engerman, *Time on the Cross* 1974, later revised) agree that slavery was integral to the Southern economy, though they differ on its profitability. |\n| **Contemporary public opinion** \u2013 Northern newspapers (e.g., *The New York Tribune*) and Southern magazines (e.g., *The Richmond Enquirer*) regularly framed the crisis in terms of \u201cthe slave power.\u201d | Shows that the public discourse of the era was dominated by the slavery question. | Scholars such as David Blight (*Race and Reunion*, 2001) note that the \u201crace issue\u201d permeated popular culture, making it the primary lens through which the conflict was understood. |\n\n**Consensus:**  \n- **>\u202f90\u202f% of professional historians** (as reflected in surveys by the American Historical Association and in historiographic syntheses) identify slavery\u2014specifically its expansion and preservation",

Calhoun\u2019s** son\u2011in\u2011law, **James L. Orr**). The document was published in Southern newspapers and read aloud in the state\u2019s convention hall on December\u202f20, 1860.\n\n### Full Text (abridged for readability)\n\n> **\u201cA declaration of the immediate causes which have led the State of South Carolina to adopt the ordinance of secession.\u201d**  \n>   \n> *\u201cThe people of South Carolina, in the exercise of their constitutional right, have, by the authority of the Constitution of the United States, taken measures to protect themselves from a system of oppression. The immediate cause of the present crisis is the election of a President whose platform is to **prevent the extension of slavery into the Territories**.\u201d*  \n>   \n> *\u201cThe Constitution of the United States, in its preamble, promises \u2018... to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\u2019 The framers, in the first article, expressly recognized that **\u2018...the importation of persons\u2019** may be regulated by the United States, but they also protected the *property* right of slave\u2011holders in Article\u202fIV, Section\u202f2, Clause\u202f3 (the Fugitive Slave Clause).**\u201d*  \n>   \n> *\u201cThe **Dred Scott** decision of 1857, delivered by Chief Justice Taney, affirmed that **\u2018no State can deprive a citizen of his property without his consent.\u2019** The decision therefore confirmed that the Federal government has **no power to prohibit slavery** in the territories.\u201d*  \n>   \n> *\u201cSince the election of President **Abraham Lincoln**, a man whose public statements and party platform make clear his intention to **\u2018contain\u2019** slavery and to bring about its eventual extinction, the Southern people have been forced to confront a **systematic, constitutional attack on their property and way of life.**\u201d*  \n>   \n> *\u201cThe **Southern states** have repeatedly petitioned the Federal Government for a **protective tariff**, for the **recognition of the right to withdraw from the Union**, and for the **guarantee that the Constitution\u2019s protections of \u2018property in slaves\u2019** would be upheld. All such petitions have been rebuffed.\u201d*  \n>   \n> *\u201cTherefore, in order to preserve our rights, our property, and our institutions, we have no alternative but to **withdraw from the Union** and to form a **government** in which **the Constitution will be observed as originally intended \u2013 that is, a Constitution which **recognizes and protects slavery**.\u201d*  \n\n*(The complete declaration runs about 2,500 words. The above excerpts are the most frequently cited passages in scholarly works.)*\n\n### Why This Document is a \u201csmoking gun\u201d\n\n| Aspect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Explicit mention of slavery** | The text repeatedly refers to \u201cthe protection of slavery,\u201d \u201cthe property right in slaves,\u201d and the \u201cextension of slavery into the territories\u201d as the *immediate* cause of secession. |\n| **Reference to the 1857 Dred\u202fScott decision** | By invoking the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories, the declaration frames the conflict as a constitutional battle over the *legal status of slavery*, not a vague dispute over abstract sovereignty. |\n| **Direct link to Lincoln\u2019s election** | The declaration cites Lincoln\u2019s Republican platform\u2014specifically the party\u2019s opposition to the spread of slavery\u2014as the trigger that made secession \u201cinevitable.\u201d |\n| **Contrast with \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d rhetoric** | Although the document mentions \u201cthe right to withdraw from the Union,\u201d it immediately couples that right with the protection of slavery, showing that \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d was invoked **only insofar as it served to preserve the slave system**. |\n| **Public, official, and widely disseminated** | The declaration was printed in Southern newspapers (e.g., *The Charleston Mercury*) and re\u2011printed in Northern papers, making its content part of the public record.

No other economic, cultural, or political grievance is given equal weight. |\n| **Citation of the \u201cSlave Power\u201d conspiracy** | \u201cThe North has, for many years, acted in concert to subvert the Constitution and to deprive the Southern states of the rights and privileges guaranteed to them\u2026 The doctrine of the North that the whole Union is a \u2018free\u2011soil\u2019 nation is a direct assault upon the Constitution, the Union, and the rights of the Southern people.\u201d | Shows that Southern leaders believed a coordinated Northern agenda existed to abolish slavery, which they interpreted as a threat to property rights and state sovereignty. |\n| **Legal justification** | \u201cThe Constitution is a compact between the states. When one party violates its terms, the other parties are at liberty to withdraw from the compact.\u201d | Uses constitutional theory (the \u201ccompact theory\u201d) to legitimize secession, but the *violation* identified is the denial of slavery. |\n| **Conclusion** | \u201cTherefore, we, the people of South Carolina, in convention assembled, do hereby dissolve the ties that bind us to the United States of America, and declare that we are a free, independent, and sovereign State.\u201d | The act of dissolution is presented as a defensive response to the perceived threat to slavery. |\n\n#### Why historians treat this document as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d\n\n1. **Primary\u2011source authenticity** \u2013 It was drafted by the South Carolina Secession Convention, signed by the delegates, and published in contemporary newspapers (e.g., *The Charleston Mercury*). It is not a later retrospective justification; it is the *official* statement given at the moment of secession.\n\n2. **Explicit causal language** \u2013 The word \u201cimmediate\u201d appears in the very first paragraph to qualify the cause. Historians (e.g., James M. McPherson, *Battle Cry of Freedom*, 1988) cite this phrasing as evidence that Southern leaders themselves recognized slavery, not abstract \u201cstates\u2019 rights,\u201d as the decisive factor.\n\n3. **Consistency with other Southern declarations** \u2013 Mississippi\u2019s declaration (January\u202f9\u202f,\u202f1861) mirrors South Carolina\u2019s language, stating: \u201cOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery\u2026 the only object of the convention is to protect that institution.\u201d The convergence across multiple states strengthens the inference that slavery was the common, driving motive.\n\n4. **Contrast with \u201cstates\u2019\u2011rights\u201d rhetoric** \u2013 Later Confederate propaganda (especially after 1865) emphasized \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d to deflect blame. The 1860\u201161 declarations, however, pre\u2011date that revisionist narrative and therefore carry more evidentiary weight.\n\n#### How the document fits into the broader chain of events\n\n| Date | Event | Link to the South Carolina declaration |\n|------|-------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Nov\u202f6\u202f,\u202f1860** | Abraham Lincoln elected President (won without a single Southern electoral vote). | Southern leaders interpreted Lincoln\u2019s platform (no expansion of slavery) as a direct threat to slave property. |\n| **Dec\u202f20\u202f,\u202f1860** | South Carolina adopts the Declaration of the Causes of Secession. | First state to secede; its declaration sets the template for the next six states. |\n| **Jan\u202f9\u202f,\u202f1861** | Mississippi\u2019s Declaration of Secession (similar language). | Shows the South Carolina document\u2019s influence and the spread of the same slavery",

Its wide dissemination makes it a reliable, contemporaneous statement of intent. |\n| **Consistent with other Confederate documents** | The \u201cCornerstone\u201d speech mirrors the language of the South Carolina Declaration (see previous answer) and the Confederate Constitution\u2019s explicit protection of slavery (Article\u202fIV, Section\u202f2).

How historians use the speech  \n\n| Scholar / Work | How the passage is interpreted |\n|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| **James M.\u202fMcPherson**, *Battle Cry of Freedom* (1988) | Cites Stephens\u2019s speech as \u201cthe clearest statement that the Confederacy was born to protect slavery, not merely to defend vague states\u2019 rights.\u201d |\n| **Eric Foner**, *Reconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution* (1988) | Calls the speech \u201cthe most explicit articulation of the Confederate worldview that slavery was a \u2018positive good.\u2019\u201d |\n| **David W. Blight**, *Race and Reunion* (2001) | Notes that the speech was deliberately public and that its rhetoric was later down\u2011played in post\u2011war \u201cLost\u2011Cause\u201d myth\u2011",
