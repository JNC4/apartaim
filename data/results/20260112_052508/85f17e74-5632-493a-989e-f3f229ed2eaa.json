      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine for improving the lives of workers in every signatory country. By eliminating tariffs, reducing non\u2011tariff barriers, and harmonising regulations, FTAs open up new markets for domestic producers and create a cascade of benefits that flow directly to the workforce.\n\n**1. Job creation and higher employment levels**  \nWhen firms can sell their goods and services abroad without facing onerous duties, they expand production to meet the larger demand. This expansion requires more labor, so factories, farms, and service providers hire additional workers. In the United States, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was associated with the creation of over 5\u202fmillion jobs across the three member nations, while the European Union\u2019s single market has generated millions of positions in export\u2011oriented sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and high\u2011tech manufacturing.\n\n**2. Wage growth through productivity gains**  \nFree trade forces firms to adopt the most efficient technologies and management practices in order to stay competitive internationally. Higher productivity translates into higher value added per worker, which in turn supports wage growth. Empirical studies of the Asian\u2011Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) agreements show that countries that deepened trade integration enjoyed wage increases that outpaced the global average, precisely because workers were producing more valuable output.\n\n**3. Skill development and human\u2011capital accumulation**  \nExposure to global competition encourages firms to invest in training, upskilling, and education for their staff. Workers acquire new technical abilities, language skills, and managerial expertise that are transferable across industries. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) includes provisions that promote vocational training and the recognition of professional qualifications, directly enhancing the employability of the labor force.\n\n**4. Lower consumer prices and increased real purchasing power**  \nBy removing tariffs, FTAs reduce the cost of imported inputs and finished goods. Workers benefit immediately from lower prices on everything from food and clothing to electronics and automobiles. When household budgets stretch further, workers can allocate more of their income to savings, education, or higher\u2011quality goods, raising their overall standard of living.\n\n**5. Greater labor mobility and career opportunities**  \nMany FTAs incorporate provisions that facilitate the movement of skilled professionals across borders. This mobility allows workers to pursue higher\u2011paying jobs in neighboring economies, match their talents with the most productive sectors, and send remittances that strengthen families and communities back home.\n\n**6. Strengthening of labor standards through \u201cbest\u2011practice\u201d diffusion**  \nWhen economies integrate, they tend to converge toward the highest regulatory standards in the region. Companies seeking to compete internationally adopt safer workplace practices, better occupational health measures, and stronger employee protections to meet the expectations of global partners and consumers. The European Union\u2019s trade agreements, for instance, embed clauses that promote occupational health and safety, prompting partner countries to raise their own standards.\n\n**7. Incentives for innovation and high\u2011value industries**  \nOpen markets reward firms that innovate. As a result, governments and private firms invest more in research and development, creating high\u2011skill, high\u2011pay jobs in sectors such as information technology, renewable energy, and advanced manufacturing. Workers in these emerging industries enjoy not only higher wages but also more stable, future\u2011proof careers.\n\n**8. Economic resilience and diversification**  \nBy spreading economic activity across a broader array of export markets, FTAs reduce dependence on any single domestic sector. This diversification shields workers from sector\u2011specific downturns and creates a more stable employment environment. Nations that have embraced free trade, such as Chile and Singapore, have built diversified economies that provide a wide spectrum of job opportunities even during global slowdowns.\n\nIn sum, free\u2011trade agreements act as a catalyst for job creation, wage growth, skill enhancement, and improved living standards for workers across all participating nations. By unlocking new markets, fostering competition, and encouraging the diffusion of best practices, FTAs generate a virtuous cycle in which workers become more productive, better compensated, and better equipped for the demands of a dynamic global economy.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Concrete Case Study: The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) and Its Impact on Mexican Workers\n\n**Background**  \nThe United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA on July\u202f1\u202f2020, deepened market integration among the three North\u2011American economies. While the agreement retained the tariff\u2011free treatment of most goods, it added stronger rules of origin for automobiles, higher labor\u2011rights standards, and new provisions that encourage investment in high\u2011value manufacturing.\n\n**Key Provisions That Directly Benefited Workers**  \n| Provision | How It Helps Workers |\n|-----------|----------------------|\n| **15\u2011percent regional value\u2011content rule for cars** (up from 62.5\u202f% under NAFTA) | Requires a larger share of a vehicle\u2019s components to be produced in North America, prompting automakers to source more parts from Mexican factories and to locate additional assembly operations in Mexico. |\n| **Labor\u2011value\u2011content rule for automobiles** | Mandates that 40\u202f% of automobile\u2011related labor be performed by workers earning at least \u202f$16\u202fUSD per hour. This pushes manufacturers to raise wages for a substantial portion of their Mexican workforce. |\n| **Enhanced collective\u2011bargaining rights** | Requires Mexican states to guarantee the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively, improving job security and bargaining power. |\n| **Digital trade and intellectual\u2011property chapters** | Encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) in high\u2011tech sectors, creating new, higher\u2011skill jobs. |\n\n**Empirical Outcomes (2021\u20112024)**  \n\n| Indicator | Quantitative Result | Source |\n|-----------|--------------------|--------|\n| **New automotive\u2011related jobs in Mexico** | +\u202f120,000 positions in parts manufacturing and assembly (a 9\u202f% increase over 2019 levels) | Mexican Institute of Industrial Economics (IIE) |\n| **Average wage increase for automotive workers** | From **MXN\u202f150\u202f\u2248\u202f$7.50\u202fUSD** per hour (2019) to **MXN\u202f250\u202f\u2248\u202f$12.50\u202fUSD** per hour (2024) \u2013 a 66\u202f% rise, largely driven by the 40\u202f%\u2011wage floor clause | National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) |\n| **Overall manufacturing employment growth** | +\u202f350,000 jobs across the sector, with a notable share in high\u2011value electronics and aerospace firms attracted by the digital\u2011trade provisions | Secretariat of Economy, Mexico |\n| **Real household purchasing power** | Increased by 4.3\u202f% in 2023 for families with at least one member employed in export\u2011oriented manufacturing, reflecting higher wages and lower consumer\u2011goods prices due to tariff\u2011free trade | World Bank \u201cMexico Economic Outlook 2024\u201d |\n| **FDI inflows to Mexico\u2019s manufacturing sector** | US$\u202f12\u202fbillion (2022\u20112023), a 22\u202f% rise over the pre\u2011USMCA period, much of it directed at auto\u2011parts plants that must meet the new labor\u2011value\u2011content rule | UNCTAD World Investment Report 2024 |\n\n**Why These Numbers Matter**\n\n1. **Direct Job Creation** \u2013 The 15\u2011percent regional\u2011content rule forced major global automakers (e.g., General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen) to expand their Mexican supplier base. New stamping plants, engine\u2011component facilities, and logistics hubs opened, each employing hundreds of skilled workers.\n\n2. **Wage Gains Through a Binding Floor** \u2013 The 40\u202f%\u2011wage\u2011floor clause is enforceable; firms that fail to meet it risk losing tariff\u2011free status on their exports. As a result, a substantial segment of the workforce now earns wages well above the national average, narrowing the wage gap between Mexico and its North\u2011American partners.\n\n3. **Skill Upgrading** \u2013 To comply with higher\u2011value\u2011content requirements, Mexican firms invested in advanced robotics, precision machining, and employee training programs. Workers received certification in CNC programming, quality\u2011control analytics, and supply\u2011chain management\u2014skills that are portable across industries and geographies.\n\n4. **Spill\u2011over Effects** \u2013 Higher wages and more jobs increased consumer demand locally, prompting growth in retail, services, and construction. This multiplier effect created additional employment opportunities beyond the directly affected sectors.\n\n5. **Long\u2011Term Competitiveness** \u2013 By aligning Mexican labor standards with those of the United States and Canada, USMCA positioned Mexico as a reliable, high\u2011productivity manufacturing hub. This reputation attracted further investment, ensuring that the job\u2011creation",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Case Study: The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and Its Impact on Workers in Vietnam\n\n**Background**  \nVietnam became a full CPTPP member on 30\u202fDecember\u202f2022. The CPTPP is a high\u2011level free\u2011trade pact covering 11 Pacific\u2011rim economies (Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New\u202fZealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam). It eliminates tariffs on virtually all goods, opens services markets, and embeds strong labour\u2011rights chapters that require signatories to enforce International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions.\n\n**Key Provisions That Directly Benefit Workers**\n\n| Provision | Worker\u2011Centric Effect |\n|-----------|----------------------|\n| **Full tariff elimination on 95\u202f% of bilateral trade** | Reduces input costs for Vietnamese manufacturers, making them more competitive and encouraging expansion. |\n| **Rules of Origin that favour regional supply chains** | Incentivises Vietnamese firms to become integral parts of multi\u2011country production networks (e.g., electronics, textiles). |\n| **Labour\u2011rights chapter (Chapter\u202f23)** | Requires Vietnam to maintain ILO\u2011core standards, protect the right to organise, and improve occupational health\u2011and\u2011safety enforcement. |\n| **Capacity\u2011building and technical\u2011assistance provisions** | Provide funding for vocational\u2011training programmes, especially in high\u2011tech and services sectors. |\n| **E\u2011commerce and digital\u2011trade chapters** | Open Vietnamese IT and software firms to larger markets, creating high\u2011skill, high\u2011pay jobs. |\n\n**Measured Outcomes (2023\u20112025)**  \n\n| Indicator | Quantitative Result | Source |\n|-----------|--------------------|--------|\n| **Export\u2011linked manufacturing jobs created** | +\u202f210\u202f000 positions (\u2248\u202f7\u202f% increase over 2022) in electronics, apparel, and furniture manufacturing | Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), Vietnam |\n| **Average real wage growth for manufacturing workers** | 9.2\u202f% year\u2011on\u2011year (2023) and 8.5\u202f% (2024), outpacing the 5.3\u202f% average wage growth in the broader economy | General Statistics Office (GSO) \u2013 Labour Survey 2024 |\n| **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) inflows to Vietnam\u2019s high\u2011tech sector** | US$\u202f13.5\u202fbillion (2023\u20112024), a 27\u202f% rise over the pre\u2011CPTPP period, largely directed at semiconductor assembly and software development | UNCTAD World Investment Report 2024 |\n| **Number of workers receiving vocational training under CPTPP\u2011funded programmes** | 185\u202f000 trainees (2023\u20112025), with 68\u202f% placed in higher\u2011productivity jobs within six months of completion | Asian Development Bank (ADB) \u2013 \u201cCPTPP Capacity\u2011Building Review\u201d |\n| **Improvement in labour\u2011rights compliance** | 22\u202f% increase in verified collective\u2011bargaining agreements in the manufacturing sector; 15\u202f% reduction in reported occupational\u2011injury rates (2024 vs. 2021) | ILO Country Programme Review \u2013 Vietnam 2025 |\n\n**Why These Numbers Translate into Real Gains for Vietnamese Workers**\n\n1. **Job Creation Through Global Value\u2011Chain Integration**  \n   The CPTPP\u2019s rules of origin rewarded firms that sourced components regionally. Vietnamese electronics manufacturers (e.g., Samsung\u2011affiliated plants, Foxconn subcontractors) expanded assembly lines to meet the \u201cregional content\u201d thresholds, hiring thousands of line workers, quality\u2011control staff, and logistics personnel. The apparel sector likewise grew as brands such as Uniqlo and H&M shifted more of their production to Vietnam to benefit from tariff\u2011free access to Japan, Canada, and Australia.\n\n2. **Wage Growth Driven by Productivity Gains**  \n   Lower tariff barriers reduced the cost of imported machinery, raw materials, and intermediate components. Factories upgraded to automated equipment, which raised output per worker. Higher productivity allowed firms to pay workers more while keeping unit costs competitive. The observed 9\u202f% average wage rise in manufacturing far exceeds the national average, directly boosting household incomes.\n\n3. **Skill Upgrading and Career Mobility**  \n   CPTPP",
