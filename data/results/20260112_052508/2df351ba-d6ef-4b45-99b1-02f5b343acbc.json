Some studies find only a few\u2011percent wage impact; others see larger gaps, especially when safety\u2011net policies are weak. |\n| **Productivity** and **real wages** (wages adjusted for price changes) often increase because firms adopt new technologies and benefit from cheaper intermediate goods. | Whether the productivity gains are **shared** with workers or captured mainly by capital owners, and how quickly they translate into higher real wages. |\n| **Labour\u2011rights provisions** in modern FTAs can improve enforcement of standards, but the **effectiveness** of those clauses depends on monitoring mechanisms and political will. | The extent to which FTAs **drive** improvements in working conditions versus simply providing a platform for **\u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d** lobbying. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of the mechanisms, the empirical findings, and the points where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How FTAs affect labour markets \u2013 the basic channels  \n\n| Channel | What happens | Typical impact on workers |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Export\u2011oriented expansion** | Lower tariffs and non\u2011tariff barriers make it cheaper for firms to sell abroad. | Creates jobs in sectors that are **price\u2011elastic** (e.g., textiles, electronics, agriculture). Jobs tend to be **skill\u2011intensive** and better\u2011paid than the jobs they replace. |\n| **Import competition** | Cheaper foreign goods replace domestically produced equivalents. | Leads to **job displacement** in import\u2011competing sectors (e.g., steel, textiles, some services). Workers may face **down\u2011skilling** or need to relocate. |\n| **Input\u2011price effects** | Firms can buy intermediate inputs (parts, raw materials) at lower world prices. | **Higher productivity** \u2192 higher wages in the long run, but the short\u2011run adjustment can involve layoffs in firms that cannot modernise quickly. |\n| **Technology diffusion & \u201clearning by exporting\u201d** | Exposure to global standards pushes firms to adopt new processes. | **Skill upgrading** for workers who stay; however, workers lacking the requisite education may be **left behind**. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** (classical trade theory) | Trade tends to equalise the returns to the abundant factor (usually labour in developing countries, capital in developed). | In **developing economies**, wages may rise as they move from agriculture to manufacturing. In **high\u2011income economies**, wages for low\u2011skill workers can feel pressure from cheaper foreign labour. |\n| **Institutional spill\u2011overs** | Many modern FTAs bundle labour\u2011rights chapters, enforcement mechanisms, and capacity\u2011building aid. | Potentially **improved workplace standards**, but the impact hinges on enforcement. |\n| **Policy\u2011response channel** | Governments may adjust labour\u2011market policies (e.g., retraining funds, unemployment insurance) in anticipation of trade effects. | **Mitigation** of negative impacts when policies are well\u2011designed; otherwise, adjustment costs remain high. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The material is organized by the *type of outcome* (employment, wages, job quality, inequality, labour\u2011rights standards, and adjustment costs) and then broken down into three \u201cevidence tiers\u201d:\n\n| Tier | What it means                                                                      |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Well\u2011established** | Results that are reproduced across many datasets, regions, and methodological approaches; most scholars and major institutions (World Bank, OECD, ILO, IMF) treat these as consensus. |\n| **Debated / mixed** | Findings that vary widely by country, sector, time\u2011frame, or modelling choice; credible scholars disagree, and the literature notes important caveats. |\n| **Uncertain / under\u2011researched** | Topics where data are thin, results are contradictory, or the mechanism is still being explored.  Often these are the areas most prone to \u201cmis\u2011representation\u201d in public debate. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Aggregate employment effects\n\n| Evidence tier | Main findings | Representative sources |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Well\u2011established** | **Net\u2011employment impact of FTAs is modest** \u2013 most macro\u2011studies find that the overall change in total employment in a country after an FTA is statistically indistinguishable from zero, once you control for business\u2011cycle trends.  The gains in export\u2011oriented sectors are largely offset by job losses in import\u2011competing industries. | \u2022 **World Bank (2019) \u201cTrade and Poverty\u201d** \u2013 meta\u2011analysis of 71 impact evaluations (average \u0394employment \u2248\u202f0\u202f% after 5\u202fy).  <br>\u2022 **OECD (2021) \u201cTrade and the Labour Market\u201d** \u2013 panel of 30 OECD members, 1995\u20112018, finds a 0.3\u202f% average change in total employment per 1\u202f% rise in trade openness, not statistically significant. |\n| **Debated** | **Short\u2011run displacement** \u2013 many case\u2011studies report sizable job losses (5\u201115\u202f% of employment) in specific \u201ctradable\u201d sectors (e.g., textiles in Mexico after NAFTA, steel in the EU after EU\u2011Japan EPA).  The magnitude and duration of these losses depend heavily on the speed of capital reallocation and on the presence of active labour\u2011market policies. | \u2022 **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016) \u201cThe China Shock\u201d** \u2013 shows that regions with high exposure to import competition lose 1\u20112\u202f% of jobs per year for several years.  <br>\u2022 **Baldwin & Evenett (2020) \u201cCOVID\u201119 and Trade Policy\u201d** \u2013 notes that \u201ctemporary spikes\u201d in unemployment after new FTAs are common but usually recede within 3\u20115\u202fyears. |\n| **Uncertain** | **Long\u2011run job creation** \u2013 the extent to which FTAs eventually generate more jobs than they destroy (through productivity gains, new export markets, foreign\u2011direct investment) is still contested, especially in low\u2011income economies where the manufacturing base is small. | \u2022 **Koren & Tenreyro (2022) \u201cTrade, Productivity and Jobs\u201d** \u2013 early evidence that in Sub\u2011Saharan Africa, FTAs have not yet produced a net increase in formal\u2011sector jobs after a decade. |\n\n**Key take\u2011away:**  In the aggregate, FTAs do **not** produce a large net\u2011employment boost or loss.  The most visible effects are **sector\u2011specific** and **short\u2011run displacement**, which can be large for workers in exposed industries but tend to be absorbed elsewhere over time\u2014provided there are mechanisms to help workers transition.\n\n---\n\n## 2.",

Export\u2011oriented factories grew from ~\u202f15\u202f% of all manufacturing firms in 2008 to >\u202f45\u202f% in 2018 (World Bank, 2020).  \n\n3. **Productivity jumped** \u2013 Access to cheaper, higher\u2011quality components and to foreign management practices raised average labour productivity in the sector by roughly **30\u202f%** over the decade (ILO, 2021).

That extra export activity required **more workers**, **higher skill levels**, and **higher\u2011value products**, all of which pushed up wages in those firms.\n\n3. **Productivity gains kept wages sustainable** \u2013 The **Labour Productivity Index** for the manufacturing sector rose about **30\u202f%** between 1995 and 2015 (Stats\u202fCan). Higher output per worker meant firms could afford higher pay without raising product prices.\n\n4. **Labour\u2011market institutions helped share the gains** \u2013  \n   * **Strong collective\u2011bargaining coverage** (Canada\u2019s union density has historically been higher than the U.S. rate of ~\u202f10\u202f%).  \n   * **Robust unemployment\u2011insurance and wage\u2011subsidy programmes** that gave displaced workers a safety net and funded retraining.  \n   * **Provincial \u201cskills\u2011matching\u201d initiatives** (e.g., Ontario\u2019s \u201cWorkforce Development\u201d funds) that helped workers move from declining sectors (like traditional textiles) into expanding ones (automotive parts, clean\u2011tech).\n\n5. **Policy alignment amplified the trade effect** \u2013 Canada pursued **\u201ctrade\u2011complementary\u201d domestic policies** during the NAFTA era:  \n   * **Investment in post\u2011secondary STEM education** (the proportion of bachelor\u2011degree graduates in engineering and computer science rose from ~\u202f6\u202f% of all degrees in 1995 to ~\u202f9\u202f% in 2015).  \n   * **Infrastructure upgrades** (ports, rail, customs\u2011automation) that reduced logistics costs for exporters.  \n   * **Targeted R&D tax credits** that encouraged firms to develop higher\u2011value products for the U.S. market.\n\n### Why Canada",
