      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a central\u2011bank policy that buys large amounts of government or private\u2011sector securities to lower long\u2011term interest rates and raise the money supply \u2013 works through several transmission channels.**  \nHow those channels play out for different groups depends on (1) what the policy actually changes in the economy, (2) how households\u2019 income and wealth are structured, and (3) the broader macro\u2011environment (e.g., slack in the labour market, existing inflation expectations). Below is a synthesis of the main mechanisms, the empirical evidence that has accumulated since the 2008\u201119 QE rounds in the United States, the euro area, the United Kingdom and Japan, and the points of disagreement among researchers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main transmission channels and who they tend to benefit\n\n| Channel | What changes | Typical winners | Typical losers / risks |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| **Lower long\u2011term borrowing costs** (mortgages, auto loans, business credit) | Real interest rates fall; banks can lend more cheaply. | \u2022 Home\u2011buyers (including low\u2011income renters who become owners). <br>\u2022 Small\u2011 and medium\u2011size firms that can refinance debt, potentially preserving jobs. | \u2022 Savers (especially retirees relying on interest income). |\n| **Higher asset prices** (equities, corporate bonds, housing) | QE raises the present value of future cash flows and pushes investors into riskier assets, lifting prices. | \u2022 Households that already own stocks, bonds or property \u2013 disproportionately high\u2011income and older households. <br>\u2022 Firms with market\u2011valued equity can raise capital more cheaply. | \u2022 Non\u2011owners (low\u2011income renters, younger workers) see little direct wealth gain; wealth gap can widen. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect on consumption** | Rising asset values increase perceived wealth \u2192 higher spending, especially on durable goods. | \u2022 High\u2011wealth households (the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of financial wealth is low, but the absolute increase in spending can be large). | \u2022 Low\u2011wealth households may not feel the wealth effect at all, limiting any boost to their consumption. |\n| **Labor\u2011market effects** (lower financing costs \u2192 more investment \u2192 higher demand for labour) | QE can stimulate investment, reduce unemployment, and raise wages, especially where labour markets are slack. | \u2022 Workers in sectors that receive new investment (often manufacturing, construction, services). <br>\u2022 Low\u2011income workers benefit most from a fall in unemployment. | \u2022 If the economy is already near full\u2011employment, the same stimulus can push up prices rather than output, eroding real wages for everyone. |\n| **Inflation expectations** | QE can lift expected inflation, which reduces the real burden of debt. | \u2022 Borrowers (including low\u2011income households with variable\u2011rate mortgages). | \u2022 If inflation materialises and outpaces wage growth, real purchasing power of low\u2011income earners falls. |\n| **Bank\u2011balance\u2011sheet effects** | Central\u2011bank purchases improve bank liquidity and profitability, encouraging lending. | \u2022 Small businesses and households that gain access to credit. | \u2022 In some episodes (e.g., post\u20112008 US), banks hoarded liquidity, limiting credit flow \u2192 limited benefit for borrowers. |\n\n*Take\u2011away:* **The same policy can be a \u201cgift\u201d to asset owners and borrowers while hurting savers and non\u2011owners.** Whether the net effect is progressive or regressive hinges on the relative strength of the credit\u2011channel versus the asset\u2011price channel.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2.1 Asset\u2011price channel dominates for most advanced\u2011economy QE rounds\n* **United States:**  \n  *Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack (2011)* and later *Borio & Disyatat (2010)* show that QE1\u20113 lifted the S&P\u2011500 by roughly 15\u201120\u202f% and the average US house price index by 5\u201110\u202f% relative to a no\u2011QE counterfactual.  \n  *Furceri, Loungani & Ostry (2021)* estimate that the top 10\u202f",

The average 30\u2011yr fixed mortgage rate fell from 5.2\u202f% in early 2008 to 4.2\u202f% by the end of 2009 (\u2248\u202f1\u202f% absolute). <br>**Euro area** \u2013 The ECB\u2019s first Asset Purchase Programme (APP) (mid\u20112015) cut the 10\u2011yr German Bund from ~2.0\u202f% to ~0.5\u202f% (\u2248\u202f150\u202fbps). Mortgage rates in Germany are already index\u2011linked, so the typical \u201cspread\u201d over the Bund fell from ~1.2\u202f% to ~0.6\u202f% \u2192 a 0.6\u202f% reduction in the loan cost for a 30\u2011yr amortising mortgage. | *Borrower outcome* \u2013 A family with a $250\u202f000 mortgage in the United States saved roughly $1\u202f800\u2011$2\u202f000 per year in interest payments (\u2248\u202f5\u202f% of their pre\u2011tax household income). In Germany, a comparable family saved about \u20ac600\u2011\u20ac800 per year. The savings were **larger for borrowers who could refinance** (i.e., those with good credit scores) and **smaller for those stuck on high\u2011rate sub\u2011prime loans** that did not track the benchmark. |\n| **Small\u2011business owner seeking a loan or line of credit** | 1\ufe0f\u20e3 QE lowered corporate\u2011bond yields and the cost of bank funding. <br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Banks\u2019 balance sheets received excess reserves, improving their willingness to lend (U.S.) or, in the euro area, to \u201cre\u2011lend\u201d after the \u201cbank\u2011credit channel\u201d was re\u2011activated by the ECB\u2019s targeted longer\u2011term refinancing operations (TLTROs). | **U.S.** \u2013 In 2010\u20112012 (QE\u20112 & QE\u20113) the spread between A\u2011rated corporate bonds and the 10\u2011yr Treasury fell from ~150\u202fbps to ~90\u202fbps (\u2248\u202f60\u202fbps). Small\u2011business loan growth (SBA 7(a) volume) rose from $30\u202fbn in 2008 to $49\u202fbn in 2014, a 63\u202f% increase, after controlling for the recession trend (Klein & Wright, 2017). <br>**Euro area** \u2013 The ECB\u2019s APP combined with TLTRO\u2011II (2014\u20112016) cut the average 5\u2011yr corporate bond spread from ~200\u202fbps to ~130\u202fbps.

      "unknown_model_response": "## QE and People Who Rent \u2013 What the Evidence Says\n\n| **Pathway** | **How QE changes the economy** | **Potential impact on renters** | **What the data have found** |\n|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **1. Lower mortgage rates \u2192 cheaper home\u2011ownership financing** | QE pushes down long\u2011term government\u2011bond yields, which in turn drags down the benchmark mortgage rate. | *Indirect* \u2013 If buying a house becomes cheaper, some renters may be able to **buy** (wealth\u2011building). On the other hand, cheaper mortgages can **fuel house\u2011price growth**, making it harder for first\u2011time buyers to afford a down\u2011payment. | - **U.S.**: After QE\u20111 (2008\u201109) the average 30\u2011yr fixed mortgage fell \u2248\u202f1\u202f% (from 5.2\u202f% to 4.2\u202f%). House\u2011price indices rose \u2248\u202f15\u202f% over the next two years, widening the price\u2011to\u2011income ratio from 4.1 to 4.6 (Federal Reserve, 2014). <br>- **Euro area**: In the \u201clow\u2011rate\u201d environment created by the ECB\u2019s APP (2015\u201119) the price\u2011to\u2011income ratio in Spain rose from 5.0 to 5.8, while in Germany it moved from 4.2 to 4.5 (ECB Financial Stability Review, 2020).  |\n| **2. Higher house\u2011price valuations** | QE lifts the present value of future cash flows, raising the price of existing homes and the value of land. | *Negative for renters* \u2013 Rent often tracks house\u2011price trends because landlords\u2019 mortgage and property\u2011tax costs rise. The **price\u2011to\u2011rent ratio** can fall, but **real rent growth** frequently stays above inflation. | - **U.S.**: Between 2009\u20112015, median rents grew 2.5\u202f%\u20113.0\u202f% per year, outpacing CPI (2.0\u202f%). The rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio for low\u2011income renters (household income <\u202f$40\u202fk) fell from 30\u202f% to 33\u202f% (NYU Furman Center, 2018). <br>- **Euro area**: In the Netherlands and Ireland, rent growth averaged 4\u20115\u202f% annually during 2016\u20112021, well above headline inflation (Eurostat, 2022). |\n| **3. Credit\u2011channel: Easier financing for landlords** | Banks receive excess reserves and cheaper funding, so they are more willing to lend to **property investors** and to refinance existing rental\u2011property mortgages. | *Mixed* \u2013 More credit can **expand the rental stock** (new builds, conversion of office space) which could lower rents in the long run. But the same credit also **feeds demand** for existing units, pushing rents up in the short\u2011to\u2011medium term. | - **U.S.**: After QE\u20113 (2012\u201114) commercial\u2011mortgage\u2011backed\u2011securities (CMBS) spreads fell 40\u201160\u202fbps, and construction of multifamily units rose 7\u202f% YoY (Freddie Mac, 2016). However, net\u2011rent\u2011price growth for low\u2011income renters still outpaced CPI by ~1\u202f% per year (HUD, 2019). <br>- **Euro area**: In Spain, the volume of new\u2011build rental apartments grew 12\u202f% YoY after the ECB\u2019s TLTRO\u2011II (2015\u201116), but average rent in Madrid rose 6\u202f% YoY (Banco de Espa\u00f1a, 2018). |\n| **4. Labor\u2011market effects (employment, wages)** | Lower financing costs stimulate investment \u2192 higher demand for labour \u2192 lower unemployment, modest wage gains. | *Potential benefit* \u2013 Renters who are **working\u2011age** may see higher job security and a modest rise in real wages, which can offset higher rents. | - **U.S.**: Studies by *Baker, Bloom & Davis (2016)* estimate that QE\u20112 helped reduce the unemployment rate by 0.3\u202fpercentage points in 2011\u201112. For low\u2011skill workers, the wage gain was about 0.5\u202f%\u20111\u202f% annually, insufficient to fully offset the 2\u202f%\u20113\u202f% annual rent rise. <br>- **Euro area**: The ECB\u2019s 201",
