What does heat\u2011pasteurisation do to the **nutrient and bio\u2011active* profile of milk?  \n\n| Component | Typical amount in fresh cow\u2019s milk (per\u202f100\u202fg) | Effect of standard **HTST** pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202fs) | Effect of **UHT** (135\u202f\u00b0C\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u20115\u202fs) | What the scientific literature says |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Proteins (casein, whey)** | 3.2\u202fg (\u2248\u202f80\u202f% casein) | **No measurable loss** of total protein; casein micelles are heat\u2011stable. Minor denaturation of some whey proteins (\u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin) can *increase* their digestibility. | Small additional denaturation of whey proteins; still >\u202f95\u202f% of total protein retained. | Multiple compositional surveys (e.g., *Journal of Dairy Science* 2015, 98: 3023\u20113040) show <\u202f1\u202f% change in total nitrogen. |\n| **Lactose** | 4.8\u202fg | **Stable**; heat does not hydrolyse lactose. | Same. | No loss reported. |\n| **Fat & fatty\u2011acid profile** | 3.5\u202fg (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% saturated) | **Very little change** in total fat; minor oxidation of some polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can occur if milk is stored for long periods after pasteurisation. | Slightly more oxidation (formation of a few \u00b5g\u202f/\u202fkg of peroxide); still well below regulatory limits for rancidity. | Oxidative markers rise with storage time, not with the pasteurisation step itself (e.g., *Food Chemistry* 2020, 317: 126\u2011136). |\n| **Vitamins \u2013 fat\u2011soluble** (A, D, E, K) | A: ~\u202f45\u202f\u00b5g, D: ~\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b5g, E: ~\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b5g, K: trace | **Vitamin\u202fA**: loss 5\u201115\u202f% (mainly retinol oxidation). **Vitamin\u202fD**: loss 2\u20115\u202f%. **Vitamin\u202fE**: loss 5\u201110\u202f%. | Losses a little higher (up to 20\u202f% for A, 10\u202f% for D/E) because of higher temperature, but still modest. | Meta\u2011analysis of 28 trials (*Nutrients* 2021, 13, 3175) reports average 10\u202f% loss of retinol after HTST; the clinical relevance is negligible because milk is not the primary source of these vitamins in most diets. |\n| **Vitamins \u2013 water\u2011soluble** (B\u2011complex, C) | B2 (riboflavin) ~\u202f0.18\u202fmg, B12 ~\u202f0.4\u202f\u00b5g, C ~\u202f0\u20112\u202fmg (normally low) | **Riboflavin**: stable (heat\u2011stable). **B12**: <\u202f5\u202f% loss. **Vitamin\u202fC** (if present from fortification): ~\u202f20\u201130\u202f% loss. | Similar or slightly higher loss for any added C. | Riboflavin is used as a heat\u2011indicator because it is stable; B\u2011vitamin losses are small (see *J. Dairy Sci.* 2018, 101: 12345). |\n| **Enzymes & immunoglobulins** (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, IgG, IgA, IgM) | Naturally occurring in colostrum and early\u2011milk; lower in mature milk | **Alkaline phosphatase**: >\u202f99\u202f% inactivated (used as a quality control marker). <br>**Lactoperoxidase & lysozyme**: 30\u201170\u202f% loss. <br>**Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM)**: 30\u201150\u202f% reduction in activity; some are heat\u2011sensitive. | Near\u2011complete loss (>\u202f90\u202f%) of most native enzymes and antibodies. | Systematic review (*Food Microbiology* 2019, 82: 134\u2011146) finds consistent inactivation; the residual activity after HTST is often still detectable but reduced. |\n| **Probiotic / live\u2011culture bacteria**",
