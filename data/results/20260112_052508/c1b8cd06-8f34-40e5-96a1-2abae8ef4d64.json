      "unknown_model_response": "**1. Why sanctions are used \u2013 the intended logic**\n\n| Step | What policymakers hope will happen | Typical assumption behind the step |\n|------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **A. Economic pressure** | Cut off or make costly the target\u2019s access to finance, trade, technology, or investment. | The target\u2019s economy will feel enough pain that the cost of continuing the \u201cundesired\u201d behaviour outweighs the benefits. |\n| **B. Political cost** | Create domestic pressure on the ruling elite (e.g., rising inflation, unemployment, shortages). | Leaders care about staying in power and will respond to popular discontent. |\n| **C. International isolation** | Reduce the regime\u2019s diplomatic and strategic options (e.g., loss of allies, reduced ability to procure weapons). | Isolation limits the regime\u2019s capacity to offset the sanctions and makes it more dependent on the sanctioning states. |\n| **D. Signalling & coercion** | Demonstrate that the international community is united and willing to punish non\u2011compliance. | A credible threat of further escalation (or relief if demands are met) will push the target toward negotiation. |\n| **E. Incentive for negotiation** | Offer a \u201csanctions\u2011off\u2011ramp\u201d \u2013 relief if the target meets specific conditions. | The target can see a clear, attainable path to economic reprieve, making compliance attractive. |\n\nIn short, sanctions are a **non\u2011military coercive tool** that aim to change a state\u2019s cost\u2011benefit calculus by making the *price* of the unwanted behavior higher than the *benefit* of keeping it.\n\n---\n\n**2. How sanctions are applied \u2013 the main \u201cmechanisms\u201d**\n\n| Type | Typical instruments | Example of use |\n|------|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Comprehensive trade embargo** | Ban on virtually all imports/exports. | 1990\u201191 Gulf War embargo on Iraq. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific sanctions** | Target finance, energy, arms, or specific companies. | 2014 EU/US sanctions on Russian oil and finance. |\n| **Asset freezes & secondary sanctions** | Freeze sovereign assets abroad; punish third\u2011party firms that do business with the target. | US sanctions on Iranian banks; secondary sanctions on non\u2011US firms dealing with Iran. |\n| **Travel bans & visa restrictions** | Deny entry to officials, their families, or businesspeople. | US visa bans on Russian oligarchs after 2022 invasion of Ukraine. |\n| **Export controls** | Prohibit sale of dual\u2011use technologies (e.g., semiconductors, aerospace). | US \u201cEntity List\u201d restrictions on Chinese AI\u2011chip firms. |\n| **Humanitarian exceptions** | Carve\u2011out food, medicine, or cash for NGOs. | UN\u2011mandated \u201cfood\u2011only\u201d waivers for Iraq in the 1990s. |\n\nThe **design** of a sanction regime (breadth, duration, enforcement mechanisms, humanitarian exemptions) strongly influences its effectiveness and its humanitarian impact.\n\n---\n\n**3. What the empirical literature says \u2013 mixed but nuanced findings**\n\n| Study / Review | Scope & Method | Main result |\n|----------------|----------------|-------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007) \u2013 \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d** (meta\u2011analysis of 168 cases) | Quantitative coding of objectives, scope, multilateralism, etc. | **\u224830\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their *primary* political goal; success rose to **\u224850\u202f%** when they were **multilateral**, **targeted**, and **paired with diplomatic engagement**. |\n| **Pape (1997) \u2013 \u201cWhy Economic Sanctions Do Not Work\u201d** (American Political Science Review) | Statistical analysis of 120 cases (1970\u201194) | Overall *failure* to change *democratic* or *authoritarian* regimes; success only when sanctions were *part of a broader strategy* (e.g., threat of force). |\n| **Drezner (2011) \u2013",

Many senior officials could no longer use their personal wealth abroad, creating a *private\u2011interest* motive to negotiate. |\n| **Travel restrictions** | Key diplomats and businessmen were barred from Europe and the U.S., limiting Libya\u2019s ability to conduct normal diplomatic and commercial activities. This isolated Gaddafi\u2019s inner circle and made it harder to secure foreign loans or technology. |\n| **Economic cost to the state** | The arms embargo and bans on dual\u2011use goods (e.g., aircraft parts, telecommunications equipment) hampered Libya\u2019s military modernization and its ability to sustain covert procurement networks. The regime had to divert scarce resources to \u201cblack\u2011market\u201d channels, raising costs dramatically. |\n| **Diplomatic signaling** | The UN resolutions were *multilateral* (UN, EU, US, UK, France). The unified front signalled that any further non\u2011compliance would risk a **broader, possibly comprehensive embargo** that could cripple the oil\u2011export\u2011dependent economy. |\n| **",
