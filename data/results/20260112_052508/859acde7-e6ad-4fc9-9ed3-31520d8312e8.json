      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nAt the level of exposure that people typically experience near a 5\u202fG cell\u2011site, the scientific consensus\u2014based on more than two\u202fdecades of research on radio\u2011frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) of similar frequencies\u2014is that no credible evidence links such exposure to adverse health effects.  Regulatory limits are set well below levels that cause known thermal (heating) effects, and large epidemiologic studies have not found consistent associations with cancer, reproductive problems, or other outcomes.  A small number of laboratory studies report biological changes at very low exposure levels, but these findings have not been replicated in independent experiments and their relevance to real\u2011world exposure remains unproven.\n\nBelow is a detailed, source\u2011by\u2011source overview that separates **well\u2011established findings** from **areas of ongoing debate**, and that explains why the issue is sometimes portrayed as more controversial than the evidence supports.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201c5\u202fG\u201d actually means for exposure\n\n| Aspect | What it is | Typical power density near a tower | How it compares to other sources |\n|--------|------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Frequency bands** | \u2022 **Sub\u20116\u202fGHz** (e.g., 3.5\u202fGHz, 2.6\u202fGHz) \u2013 similar to existing 4G/LTE<br>\u2022 **mmWave** (24\u201139\u202fGHz, sometimes up to 60\u202fGHz) \u2013 higher frequency, lower penetration depth | \u2022 Sub\u20116\u202fGHz: <\u202f0.1\u202fW/m\u00b2 at the public\u2011accessible ground level (often <\u202f0.01\u202fW/m\u00b2)<br>\u2022 mmWave: <\u202f0.01\u202fW/m\u00b2 (the beam is highly directional and attenuates quickly) | \u2022 Typical Wi\u2011Fi router: \u2248\u202f0.001\u202fW/m\u00b2 at 1\u202fm<br>\u2022 Mobile phone held to the head: \u2248\u202f1\u201310\u202fW/kg SAR (local tissue heating) \u2013 orders of magnitude higher than ambient tower exposure |\n| **Antenna design** | Sector antennas that focus most energy horizontally (toward users) and vertically (downward). The main beam is a few metres above the ground; the field at ground level drops steeply with distance. |  |  |\n| **Regulatory limits** | Set by **ICNIRP (2020)**, **IEEE C95.1\u20112019**, and most national bodies. For the general public: <\u202f10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (2\u20136\u202fGHz) and <\u202f1\u202fW/m\u00b2 (mmWave). | Measured levels around operational 5\u202fG sites are usually **1\u20132 orders of magnitude** below these limits. |  |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The ambient RF field from a 5\u202fG tower is *much* weaker than the limits designed to avoid known thermal effects, and it is generally weaker than the exposure you get from everyday devices (smartphones, Wi\u2011Fi, Bluetooth) when you use them.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Biological mechanisms that are *known* to cause harm\n\n| Mechanism | Exposure level needed | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------------------|----------|\n| **Thermal (heating) effects** \u2013 tissue temperature rise >\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C | Power density \u2273\u202f10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (or SAR \u2273\u202f2\u202fW/kg for whole\u2011body exposure) | Well\u2011documented in occupational settings (e.g., radar, microwave ovens). Regulatory limits are built to keep exposures far below this threshold. |\n| **Non\u2011thermal effects** \u2013 changes in cell signaling, DNA damage, oxidative stress *without* measurable heating | **Not established** \u2013 laboratory studies use exposures many times higher than ambient levels, and reproducibility is poor | The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified *radio\u2011frequency electromagnetic fields* as **\u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group\u202f2B)** in 2011, based largely on limited epidemiologic data for heavy, long\u2011term mobile\u2011phone use, not on ambient tower exposure. |\n\n**Key point:** The only biologically validated mechanism at exposure levels encountered near towers is heating, and those levels are far below what is encountered in the public environment.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
