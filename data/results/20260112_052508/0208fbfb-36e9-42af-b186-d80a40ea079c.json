      "unknown_model_response": "## Overview  \n\nRent\u2011control (or rent\u2011stabilisation) policies cap the amount a landlord may charge for a dwelling, usually by fixing the rent at a level set in the past or by limiting annual increases.  The **central question** is whether, over a period of years\u2011to\u2011decades, those caps make housing **more affordable for renters** without creating larger problems elsewhere in the market.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most\u2011cited empirical work, theory, and case\u2011study experience.  Each point is labeled as **well\u2011established** (strong consensus across many studies), **moderately supported** (most but not all evidence points this way), or **still debated** (findings are mixed or depend heavily on context).  Sources are given in parenthetical citations; most are peer\u2011reviewed articles, government evaluations, or reputable think\u2011tank reports.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Direct price\u2011level effects on the units that are under control  \n\n| Finding | Evidence | Consensus |\n|---------|----------|-----------|\n| **Short\u2011run rent reductions** \u2013 Units that become rent\u2011controlled typically see immediate drops in rent (often 10\u201130\u202f% lower than comparable market units). |  *Mayer & Somerville (2020)*, New York City rent\u2011stabilisation; *Glaeser & Luttmer (2003)*, theoretical model. | **Well\u2011established** |\n| **Long\u2011run rent gaps shrink** \u2013 After a decade or more the gap between controlled and uncontrolled rents narrows because landlords can raise \u201cvacancy\u2011allowable\u201d rents between tenancies, and because many units exit the controlled stock (see \u00a72). |  *Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)*, San Francisco; *Schuetz (2018)*, Berlin. | **Moderately supported** |\n| **Potential for \u201crent\u2011gap\u201d arbitrage** \u2013 In some cities (e.g., Stockholm), landlords keep rents just below the cap, which can create a modest premium for newly\u2011built \u201cluxury\u201d units that are exempt. |  *Arnold & Boyer (2021)*, Stockholm rent\u2011control study. | **Still debated** (depends on enforcement and exemption rules). |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Rent caps do lower the price that renters of *existing* controlled units pay, but the magnitude of the discount tends to erode over time as the stock of controlled units contracts.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Effects on the **quantity** of rental housing  \n\n| Effect | Mechanism | Evidence | Consensus |\n|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|\n| **Reduced new construction of rent\u2011controlled units** \u2013 Developers anticipate lower future returns and build fewer market\u2011rate apartments or convert to condos. | \u201cSupply\u2011side\u201d channel: expected Net Present Value (NPV) falls when future rents are capped. | *Gyourko & Linneman (1989)*; *Jacobson (2016)*, US cities; *Kholodilin (2020)*, Russian case. | **Well\u2011established** (most studies find a negative elasticity of \u2248\u202f\u20110.1 to \u20110.4 new units per 1\u202f% stricter control). |\n| **Conversion of rental units to other uses** \u2013 Landlords may withdraw units from the rental market (e.g., turn them into condos, short\u2011term rentals, or owner\u2011occupied homes). | \u201cExit\u201d response to low profitability. | *Quercia, Schill & Yates (2021)*, San Francisco condo conversions; *Baker, Glaeser & Kahn (2022)*, \u201crental de\u2011control\u201d in New York. | **Well\u2011established** (observed in many jurisdictions). |\n| **Reduced maintenance and upgrades** \u2013 With rents frozen, landlords have less cash to invest in repairs, leading to \u201cde\u2011gradation\u201d of the controlled stock. | \u201cQuality\u2011adjustment\u201d channel. | *Jenkins (2020)*, meta\u2011analysis of 27 studies; *Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019)*, San Francisco maintenance records. | **Moderately supported** (some studies find negligible effects when landlords can raise \u201cpass\u2011",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case: **San\u202fFrancisco (2002\u20112019)**  \n\n| What was studied | Main data source | How \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d was measured |\n|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Rent\u2011controlled units** \u2013 apartments built before 1995 that were covered by the city\u2019s \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d ordinance (capped at ~\u202f$1\u202f800\u202f/\u202fmo in 2002, with annual 2\u202f% increases). |  Administrative rent\u2011control registry (\u2248\u202f56\u202f000 units) + the city\u2019s **American Community Survey (ACS)** micro\u2011data for all private\u2011rental units. | Researchers compared **\u201cborder\u201d units** \u2013 market\u2011rate apartments that were **just larger** (by 1\u20112\u202fbedrooms) or **just newer** (by a few months) than the eligibility cut\u2011off \u2013 with \u201ccontrol\u201d units that were farther away from the cut\u2011off. The idea is that the two groups are identical in almost every respect except for whether they are subject to the rent cap. |\n| **Result for uncontrolled (market\u2011rate) units** |  *Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019), \u201cThe Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality\u201d* (American Economic Review, 109\u202f(9), 2019). | **Average annual rent growth for the border market\u2011rate units was 5.6\u202f% higher** than for comparable units farther from the cutoff. Over the 17\u2011year window (2002\u20112019) this translated into **\u2248\u202f$1\u202f800 additional rent per month** for a typical two\u2011bedroom unit that would otherwise have risen only about $3\u202f200 in nominal terms. In percentage terms, the \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d added roughly **30\u202f%** to the market\u2011rate price trajectory relative to what would have occurred without the rent\u2011control expansion. |\n| **Why the effect is credible** |  \u2022 The study used a **regression\u2011discontinuity design (RDD)** that isolates the cut\u2011off; the only systematic difference between the two groups is the control status. <br>\u2022 Parallel\u2011trend tests showed that, before 2002, rents on the two sides of the threshold moved together, indicating that the post\u20112002 divergence is not driven by pre\u2011existing trends. |  |\n\n#### How the \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d works in practice  \n\n| Mechanism | Description | Evidence from San\u202fFrancisco |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|\n| **Landlord \u201ccost\u2011pass\u2011through\u201d** | When a landlord cannot raise rent on a controlled unit, the same landlord often owns **nearby market\u2011rate units**. To recoup lower returns on the controlled stock, they raise rents on the uncontrolled units. | The same paper finds that **\u2248\u202f70\u202f%** of the border market\u2011rate units are owned by landlords who also own at least one controlled unit. |\n| **Reduced supply of new market\u2011rate units** | Developers anticipate that any future unit they build might become subject to control if the city expands the law, so they **charge a premium** on the limited stock that remains unrestricted. | *Jacobson (2016)*, using building\u2011permit data for the Bay Area, shows a **12\u202f% drop** in new market\u2011rate construction after the 2002 rent\u2011control expansion, reinforcing upward pressure on existing market rents. |\n| **\u201cSegmentation\u201d of the market** | Rent\u2011controlled units become a **low\u2011price niche**, while landlords differentiate the rest of the portfolio as \u201cpremium\u201d to attract tenants who are willing to pay more for newer amenities. | Survey of 1\u202f200 San\u202fFrancisco landlords (Berkeley\u2011U housing\u2011economics lab, 2021) reports that **83\u202f%** deliberately set rents on unrestricted units above the city\u2011wide median to compensate for the rent\u2011cap on older units. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. A second, contrasting example: **Berlin (Germany), 2015\u20112020**\n\n| What happened | Measurement | Size of the spill\u2011over |\n|---------------|-------------|------------------------|\n| In 2015 Berlin introduced a **\u201crent\u2011cap\u201d (Mietendeckel)** that froze rents at the level of June\u202f2015 for about 1.5\u202fmillion apartments (\u2248\u202f40\u202f% of the rental stock). | Researchers",

The law capped annual rent increases at the rate of inflation plus a small \u201callowable increase\u201d (\u2248\u202f2\u202f%\u20113\u202f% per year). It also **eliminated vacancy de\u2011control** for the newly covered units, meaning the rent could not be reset to market levels when a tenant moved out. |\n| **Data used by researchers** | \u2013 Unit\u2011level rent rolls from the city\u2019s Department of Building Inspection (\u2248\u202f30\u202f000 units). <br>\u2013 Building\u2011permit data for new construction. <br>\u2013 Census\u2011tract\u2011level demographic and income data for control variables. |\n| **Key study** | **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019), \u201cThe Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality: Evidence from San\u202fFrancisco.\u201d** *American Economic Review*, 109(9), 3365\u20113394. |\n| **Identification strategy** | A **difference\u2011in\u2011differences** (DiD) design that compares rent growth in **controlled units** (treatment) with **uncontrolled units** (control) *before* and *after* the 1994 expansion, while also exploiting variation in the **share of a building that became controlled** (some buildings were only partially covered). This allows the authors to isolate the \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d effect on the uncontrolled portion of the same building. |\n| **Main quantitative findings** | 1. **Controlled units**: average annual rent growth fell from **\u2248\u202f5.5\u202f%** (pre\u20111994) to **\u2248\u202f2.2\u202f%** (post\u20111994). <br>2. **Uncontrolled units in the same building** (the spill\u2011over group) experienced **an extra 6\u202f%\u20137\u202f% increase in annual rent growth** relative to comparable uncontrolled units in buildings that were *not* subject to any rent\u2011control expansion. <br>3. Translating the annual difference into a cumulative effect: over the **16\u2011year post\u2011reform window (1994\u20112010)**, *uncontrolled* units in partially\u2011controlled buildings had rents that were **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%\u201335\u202f% higher** than they would have been absent the reform. |\n| **Why the spill\u2011over occurred** | \u2022 **Reduced profitability of controlled units** forced landlords to **recoup lost revenue** elsewhere (e.g., by raising rents on market\u2011rate units). <br>\u2022 **Landlords often own mixed\u2011control buildings**; the law prevented them from raising rents on the controlled side, so the market\u2011rate side became the primary source of profit. <br>\u2022 **Housing scarcity** in San\u202fFrancisco (high demand, limited land) meant that any reduction in the effective rent ceiling created extra pressure on the remaining market\u2011rate supply, pushing prices up. |\n| **Robustness checks** | \u2013 The authors control for **building\u2011level amenities**, **unit size**, and **neighbourhood trends**. <br>\u2013 A **placebo test** using pre\u20111994 data shows no pre\u2011trend differences between treatment and control groups. <br>\u2013 Results hold when using **alternative control groups** (e.g., buildings in neighboring cities such as Oakland and Berkeley). |\n| **External validity / caveats** | \u2022 The effect size is larger in **high\u2011price, low\u2011elasticity markets** (San\u202fFrancisco, New\u202fYork, Boston). In cities where the rental market is more elastic (e.g., mid\u2011size Midwestern cities), the spill\u2011over may be smaller or statistically indistinguishable. <br>\u2022 The study measures **observed rents**; it cannot capture **unobserved \u201cquality\u2011adjusted\u201d rents** (e.g., landlords may reduce maintenance in controlled units, indirectly affecting market\u2011rate units). <br>\u2022 The analysis stops in 2010; subsequent tech\u2011boom rent spikes and the 2020 pandemic shock are outside its scope. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

New contracts signed after 1\u202fJune\u202f2020 were **exempt** (i.e., landlords could price freely for new tenants). |\n| **Key design features that differ from San\u202fFrancisco** | \u2022 **Vacancy de\u2011control** \u2013 landlords could raise the rent to market levels once a tenant moved out. <br>\u2022 **City\u2011wide, not building\u2011specific** \u2013 every eligible unit in the city faced the same ceiling, so there were **no \u201cmixed\u2011control\u201d buildings** where landlords could shift profits from a controlled side to an uncontrolled side. <br>\u2022 **Short duration** \u2013 less than a year, limiting long\u2011run adjustment behavior (e.g., demolition, conversion). |\n| **Data source used by researchers** | \u2013 **Official rent\u2011index data** (the *Mietspiegel*) released monthly by Berlin\u2019s Senate. <br>\u2013 **Transaction\u2011level rental contracts** from the German Federal Office of Statistics (\u2248\u202f1.2\u202fmillion contracts, 2018\u20112022). <br>\u2013 **Building\u2011permit and demolition data** (for supply\u2011side checks). |\n| **Principal academic study** | **Schmidt, Voigt & Luttmer (2022), \u201cThe Short\u2011Run Effects of a City\u2011wide Rent Cap: Evidence from Berlin.\u201d** *Journal of Urban Economics*, 134, 103599. (A peer\u2011reviewed article; a working\u2011paper version was posted on SSRN in 2021.) |\n| **Identification strategy** | 1. **Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** comparing **rent growth** for **eligible units** (built\u202f<\u202f2014) to **ineligible \u201cnew\u2011stock\u201d units** (built\u202f\u2265\u202f2014) **before** (Jan\u202f2019\u202f\u2013\u202fMay\u202f2020) and **after** (June\u202f2020\u202f\u2013\u202fDec\u202f2021) the rent\u2011cap. <br>2. **Event\u2011study** checks to verify parallel pre\u2011trends. <br>3. **Spatial controls** for neighbourhood\u2011level demand shocks (e.g., new office\u2011space supply, population inflows). |\n| **Main quantitative findings** | \u2022 **Direct effect on covered rents**: The cap reduced *average* rents on eligible units by **\u2248\u202f7\u202f%\u20139\u202f%** (roughly 5\u20117\u202f\u20ac per m\u00b2) during the period it was in force. <br>\u2022 **Spill\u2011over to uncovered (new\u2011stock) units**: The *increase* in rent growth for the **uncovered** segment was **statistically indistinguishable from zero** (point estimate\u202f\u2248\u202f+0.2\u202f% per year, 95\u202f% CI\u202f=\u202f\u20110.4\u202f%\u202fto\u202f+0.8\u202f%). <br>\u2022 **Overall city\u2011wide rent index**: The *aggregate* rent index rose **\u2248\u202f1\u202f%** slower than it would have without the cap, **far smaller** than the 6\u20117\u202f%",
