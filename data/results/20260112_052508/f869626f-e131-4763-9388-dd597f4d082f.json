      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe academic literature finds that economic sanctions *sometimes* succeed in changing a target\u2019s policy, but they do so unevenly. Roughly one\u2011third to one\u2011half of sanction episodes achieve at least one of their stated objectives, and success is far more likely when sanctions are multilateral, target a relatively open economy, and are coupled with a clear diplomatic \u201coff\u2011ramps\u201d for the target to meet. In many cases the desired behavior does **not** change, or the sanctions produce only limited concessions while imposing large humanitarian costs.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most frequently cited evidence, organized by (1) the overall empirical findings, (2) the conditions that make sanctions more or less effective, (3) illustrative case studies, and (4) methodological cautions and remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The material is grouped by the *type of claim* (evidence of success, evidence of failure, conditional findings, and side\u2011effects) and each section notes where a scholarly consensus exists, where the debate is still lively, and what evidence is often missed or misunderstood.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
