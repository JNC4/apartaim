      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurised milk \u2013 what the science says about safety**\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based comparison that brings together the most relevant data from public\u2011health agencies (CDC, FDA, WHO, EFSA), peer\u2011reviewed studies, and the few well\u2011controlled trials that have examined raw\u2011milk consumption.  The goal is to show the *range* of risks and benefits so you can weigh them against your own circumstances.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201cpasteurisation\u201d does\n\n| Process | Typical temperature & time* | Main effect on the milk |\n|---------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | ~5\u2011log (100\u202f000\u2011fold) reduction of *most* pathogenic bacteria |\n| **High\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs | Similar 5\u2011log kill; most common commercial method |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs | 6\u2011log kill; extends shelf\u2011life (months) but can alter flavour and some heat\u2011sensitive nutrients |\n\n*Log reduction = factor by which viable bacteria are reduced. A 5\u2011log reduction means 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2075 fewer live organisms.*\n\nThe process **does not sterilise** the milk; a few heat\u2011resistant spores may survive, but the overwhelming majority of disease\u2011causing bacteria are destroyed.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Pathogen profile \u2013 what you\u2019re most likely to encounter\n\n| Pathogen | Typical source in raw milk | Illness severity (average) | Frequency in outbreaks (U.S., 2000\u20112022) |\n|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **_Salmonella_ spp.** | Infected cows, contaminated equipment | Gastroenteritis; 1\u20133\u202f% need hospitalisation | 38\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks (CDC) |\n| **_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 & STEC** | Fecal contamination | Bloody diarrhoea, HUS (\u22485\u202f% of cases) | 22\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks |\n| **_Listeria monocytogenes_** | Environmental contamination, biofilms | Septicemia, meningitis; high mortality in pregnant women & immunocompromised (\u224830\u202f% fatal) | 12\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks |\n| **_Campylobacter jejuni_** | Fecal shedding | Diarrhoea, Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (rare) | 8\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks |\n| **_Staphylococcus aureus_ (enterotoxin)** | Mastitis\u2011infected cows, poor hygiene | Food\u2011borne intoxication (vomiting) | 5\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks |\n| **_Mycobacterium bovis_ (bovine TB)** | Rare in many countries, but possible | Pulmonary TB; long incubation | <1\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks (mostly historic) |\n\n**Pasteurised milk:** The same pathogens are *rare* because the heat step kills >99.999\u202f% of viable cells. Sporadic post\u2011process contamination can occur (e.g., during packaging), but documented outbreaks from commercially pasteurised milk are **extremely uncommon** (\u22481\u20112 cases per decade in the U.S.).\n\n**Quantitative risk:**  \n- A 2012 CDC analysis of 2007\u20112012 outbreaks in the United States found **48\u202f% of all milk\u2011related outbreaks** were linked to raw milk, accounting for **~4\u202f% of all food\u2011borne illness** overall (\u22485,800 illnesses, 150 hospitalisations, 5 deaths).  \n- In contrast, commercially pasteurised milk contributed to **<0.01\u202f%** of reported food\u2011borne outbreaks in the same period.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Who is most vulnerable?\n\n| Population | Why they matter | Estimated risk increase (raw milk) |\n|------------|----------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Infants\u202f<\u202f1\u202fyr** | Immature gut barrier, developing immune system",

What the \u201craw\u2011milk advantage\u201d crowd usually points to  \n\n| Claim | What raw\u2011milk advocates say | Typical supporting evidence cited |\n|-------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Higher levels of \u201cgood\u201d nutrients** (vitamins, enzymes, bio\u2011active proteins) | Heat destroys vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011complex vitamins, certain enzymes (e.g., lactase, lipase), immunoglobulins, and \u201cgrowth factors\u201d that help gut development. | Early 20th\u2011century laboratory analyses; a few modern compositional studies that show modest differences (see section\u202f2). |\n| **Probiotic / \u201cfriendly\u201d bacteria** | Raw milk contains a diverse microbiota that may colonise the gut, improve digestion, and out\u2011compete pathogens. | Culture\u2011based surveys of raw\u2011milk microbiomes; anecdotal reports of improved tolerance to lactose. |\n| **Reduced risk of allergies, asthma, and eczema** | Children who drink raw milk are less likely to develop atopic disease; the \u201cfarm\u2011yard effect\u201d is stronger when milk is unprocessed. | Observational cohort studies from Europe (especially the \u201cKlein\u201d and \u201cAalborg\u201d studies) that compare raw\u2011milk\u2011drinking families with pasteurised\u2011milk families. |\n| **Better digestibility for lactose\u2011intolerant adults** | Raw milk\u2019s native lactase and bacterial \u03b2\u2011galactosidase pre\u2011digest lactose, making it easier to tolerate. | Small crossover trials (n\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u201350) that measured breath\u2011hydrogen after raw\u2011vs\u2011pasteurised milk. |\n| **\u201cNatural\u201d or \u201cwhole\u2011food\u201d status** | Because it is not heated, the milk remains in its original biochemical state, which some people equate with \u201cmore wholesome.\u201d | Philosophical / cultural arguments rather than data. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the scientific literature actually shows  \n\n### 2.1.  Nutrient content \u2013 are the differences meaningful?\n\n| Nutrient | Typical change after HTST pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs) | Evidence |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| **Vitamin\u202fC** | 10\u201330\u202f% loss (milk contains very little to begin with) | FDA Food Code, 2013; USDA Nutrient Database |\n| **Thiamine (B1)** | 5\u201315\u202f% loss | USDA 2018 analysis |\n| **Riboflavin (B2)** | <5\u202f% loss (heat\u2011stable) | Same source |\n| **Vitamin\u202fB12** | <5\u202f% loss | Same source |\n| **Vitamin\u202fD** | No change (fat\u2011soluble, heat\u2011stable) | Same source |\n| **Protein (casein, whey) & minerals (Ca, P, K)** | No measurable loss | Multiple peer\u2011reviewed studies (e.g., *J. Dairy Sci.* 2015, 98: 3102\u20113112) |\n| **Enzymes (lipase, lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, immunoglobulins)** | 20\u201170\u202f% reduction, but the absolute amount in milk is already low | H. Chen et\u202fal., *Food Chemistry* 2020; M. H. McMahon, *J. Food Prot.* 2019 |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  \n- The **absolute differences** in most vitamins are tiny because milk is not a major source of them to begin with.  \n- Heat\u2011labile enzymes and immunoglobulins are indeed reduced, but the quantities that survive pasteurisation are still present in milligram\u2011per\u2011liter ranges and are **not required for human nutrition**.  \n- No large\u2011scale randomized trial has shown that these modest compositional changes translate into measurable health outcomes.\n\n### 2.2.  Probiotic\u2011type bacteria and the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d argument  \n\n- **Raw milk microbiome**: Culture\u2011independent sequencing (16S rRNA) from farms in Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the U.S. shows >200 bacterial taxa, many of which are lactic\u2011acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus) and environmental microbes (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter).  \n- **Pasteurised milk**: After HTST, viable bacterial counts drop to <10\u202fCFU/mL; any later growth comes from post\u2011process contamination, usually **non\u2011lactobacilli** (e.g., *Pseudomonas* spp.) that can cause spoilage, not probiotic effects.  \n\n**Research status",

All had consumed raw milk from the same farm; two additional \u201cprobable\u201d cases were later identified but not counted in the official CDC tally because they lacked a laboratory confirmation. |\n| **Hospitalisations** | \u202f**5** of the 13 (\u224838\u202f%). All five required admission to an intensive\u2011care unit (ICU) for monitoring of renal function and fluid balance. |\n| **Severe outcomes** | \u202f- **2** patients developed **haemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS)**, the most serious complication of STEC infection. Both required temporary dialysis; one recovered fully, the other retained mild chronic kidney\u2011function reduction at 6\u2011month follow\u2011up. <br>\u2011 No deaths were reported, but the outbreak was classified by the CDC as **\u201chigh\u2011severity\u201d** because >30\u202f% of cases required ICU care and there were HUS cases. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u202f- **California Department of Public Health (CDPH)** issued an immediate *public health advisory* (19\u202fJuly) warning consumers to stop drinking raw milk from the farm.<br>\u2011 **FDA** and **USDA** inspected the dairy, collected milk samples, and found **high bacterial counts (\u224810\u2076\u202fCFU/mL)** of *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 in bulk tank milk and in the raw\u2011milk cooler.<br>\u2011 The farm voluntarily **shut down** raw\u2011milk sales on 20\u202fJuly; the state later **revoked** the farm\u2019s \u201craw\u2011milk permit\u201d (the licence that allows a farm to sell un\u2011pasteurised milk directly to consumers).<br>\u2011 A **recall notice** was posted on the CDC\u2019s *Foodborne Outbreak Online Database (FOOD*\u2011**Net*)** and on the USDA\u2019s *Food Safety and Inspection Service* (FSIS) website. |\n| **Investigative findings** | \u202f- The source of contamination was traced to **fecal shedding** by a cow that had a sub\u2011clinical mastitis infection. The cow\u2019s udder was not cleaned adequately before milking, and the bulk\u2011tank cooler was not kept at the recommended \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C, allowing the bacteria to multiply. <br>\u2011 The farm\u2019s **hygiene plan** did not meet the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) guidelines for raw\u2011milk dairies (e.g., lack of routine pasteurisation verification, insufficient cleaning\u2011in\u2011place procedures). |\n| **Long\u2011term impact** | \u202f- The outbreak prompted a **state\u2011wide review** of raw\u2011milk licensing in California. The CDFA introduced stricter temperature\u2011monitoring requirements and mandated quarterly microbial testing for all raw\u2011milk dairies. <br>\u2011 Media coverage raised public awareness; sales of raw milk in the region dropped by an estimated **\u224830\u202f%** in the 6\u202fmonths following the incident (based on voluntary sales reports from local farms). |\n\n#### Why this outbreak matters\n\n| Aspect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Pathogen potency** | *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 produces Shiga toxins that can damage the kidneys even at low infectious doses (\u224810\u2013100 organisms).
