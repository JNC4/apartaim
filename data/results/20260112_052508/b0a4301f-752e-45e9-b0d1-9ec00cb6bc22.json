The big\u2011picture consensus among economists  \n\n| Finding (high\u2011level) | Typical supporting evidence | Caveats / limits |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| **FTAs raise average national welfare** | Meta\u2011analyses of hundreds of case studies (e.g., *World Bank 2021*, *Baccini & De\u202fGiorgi 2020*) show gains in GDP per\u2011capita of 0.2\u20110.6\u202f% per\u202fpercentage\u2011point increase in trade intensity. | Gains are *average* effects; they do not tell us *who* gains or loses. |\n| **Consumers benefit from lower prices and more variety** | Price\u2011elasticity studies of import\u2011price reductions after NAFTA, the EU\u2011Canada CETA, and the CPTPP show 5\u201115\u202f% price drops in many consumer goods. | Price benefits are larger for higher\u2011income households that spend more on tradable goods; low\u2011income households spend a larger share of income on non\u2011tradables, so the direct consumption gain is modest for them. |\n| **Export\u2011oriented sectors tend to create higher\u2011paying jobs** | Sector\u2011level data from the EU\u2019s \u201csingle market\u201d and the US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) show employment growth in manufacturing that is integrated into global value chains, with wage growth above the national average. | Growth is concentrated in regions with pre\u2011existing skills, infrastructure, and transport links; other regions may see little or no spill\u2011over. |\n| **Adjustment costs are real and can be sizable** | Studies of \u201ctrade\u2011adjustment\u201d (e.g., Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013 on the U.S. \u201cChina shock\u201d) find that workers displaced from import\u2011competing industries experience earnings losses of 10\u201130\u202f% that can persist for a decade. | The magnitude varies with labor\u2011mobility, unemployment insurance, retraining programs, and the *type* of FTA (most\u2011favoured\u2011nation clauses, rules\u2011of\u2011origin, labor\u2011side agreements). |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  The *scientific* consensus is that FTAs are net\u2011positive for a country\u2019s economy, but the distribution of those gains is uneven. The biggest empirical debate is *how large* the adjustment costs are, and *what policies* can smooth the transition for displaced workers.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How FTAs affect workers \u2013 the mechanisms\n\n### 2.1 Direct wage and employment effects  \n\n| Mechanism | What typically happens | Evidence & examples |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented expansion** | Firms that can sell to the partner market expand output, often hiring more skilled labor and raising average wages in those sectors. | EU\u2011Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) \u2013 Japanese firms increased R&D hiring in Europe; US\u2011Canada trade liberalisation raised wages in Canadian high\u2011tech manufacturing (Statistics Canada 2019). |\n| **Import competition** | Cheaper foreign goods replace domestically produced ones, leading to layoffs in the affected sector (often low\u2011skill, labor\u2011intensive). | NAFTA\u2019s impact on US \u201clow\u2011skill manufacturing\u201d \u2013 a 1\u202f% rise in import penetration reduced manufacturing employment by about 0.3\u202f% (Autor et\u202fal., 2016). |\n| **Productivity spill\u2011overs** | Exposure to foreign competition forces domestic firms to adopt better technologies, which can raise wages for workers who stay. | Studies of the \u201cChile\u2011U",
