      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurised milk \u2013 what the science says about safety**\n\n| Aspect | Raw (un\u2011treated) milk | Pasteurised milk (HTST, UHT, etc.) |\n|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **How it\u2019s processed** | No heat treatment; milk is cooled and sold directly after milking. | Heated to a defined temperature\u2011time combination that kills the vast majority of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201chigh\u2011temperature short\u2011time\u201d (HTST) or 135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fs \u2013 UHT). |\n| **Typical microbial load** | Can contain a wide range of bacteria, including **pathogenic** species that are naturally present in the cow\u2019s udder, on the farm environment, or introduced during milking. Common culprits: *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Salmonella* spp., *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and various coliforms. | Heat kills >99.99\u202f% of vegetative pathogens. Only heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Clostridium* spp.) may survive, but they are rare in milk and usually do not cause disease in healthy people. |\n| **Reported illness rates (US data, 2007\u20112022)** | \u2022 2019\u20112022 CDC outbreak database: 127 confirmed outbreaks linked to raw milk, causing **\u2248\u202f1,800 illnesses, 38 hospitalisations, 2 deaths**. <br>\u2022 Approx. **1\u20112 illnesses per 10,000** servings of raw milk (estimate varies by region and farm hygiene). | \u2022 <\u202f0.1 illnesses per 10,000 servings of commercially pasteurised milk. <br>\u2022 No large\u2011scale outbreaks in the U.S. attributed to properly pasteurised retail milk in the last two decades. |\n| **Vulnerable groups** | Infants, young children, pregnant women, elderly, immunocompromised individuals are **especially at risk** because even a low dose of pathogen can cause severe disease (e.g., meningitis from *Listeria*, haemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome from *E.\u202fcoli* O157). | Same groups are **much less at risk**; the residual risk is essentially the same as for any other packaged food (contamination after pasteurisation is possible but rare). |\n| **Nutrient/ bioactive\u2011component differences** | \u2022 Slightly higher levels of heat\u2011sensitive enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, lactoperoxidase) and some vitamins (C, B\u2011complex). <br>\u2022 Presence of native milk microbiota that can include probiotic strains, though the composition is highly variable and not reliably beneficial. | \u2022 Enzyme activity is largely destroyed (the FDA requires alkaline phosphatase to be inactivated as a quality check). <br>\u2022 Minor loss of heat\u2011labile vitamins (\u2248\u202f10\u201115\u202f% loss of vitamin\u202fC; B\u2011vitamins are largely retained). <br>\u2022 No consistent loss of protein quality or calcium. |\n| **Evidence for health benefits** | \u2022 Some small observational studies suggest lower rates of asthma or allergies in children who consume raw milk, but these are **confounded by lifestyle, genetics, and farm exposure**. <br>\u2022 No high\u2011quality randomised trials proving a causal benefit. | \u2022 Provides the same macro\u2011 and micronutrients as raw milk; any health advantage must come from the nutrients that survive pasteurisation, which are essentially unchanged. |\n| **Regulatory stance (major agencies)** | \u2022 **U.S. FDA, CDC, WHO, EFSA**: advise *against* consumption of raw milk for the general public. <br>\u2022 Some U.S. states allow on\u2011farm sales with strict herd\u2011",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A recent raw\u2011milk outbreak (2023\u20112024)\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Date & location** | **July\u202f2023 \u2013 August\u202f2023**, Mid\u2011Atlantic United States (Virginia & Maryland). |\n| **Pathogen** | *Campylobacter jejuni* (a bacterium that causes gastro\u2011enteritis, sometimes bloody diarrhea and fever). |\n| **Source** | Unpasteurised (raw) cow\u2019s milk sold directly from a small family\u2011run farm to local \u201cfarm\u2011gate\u201d customers and a few nearby restaurants. |\n| **Number of cases** | **31 confirmed cases** (CDC case definition), plus 6 probable cases. |\n| **Hospitalisations & severity** | 2 people required hospitalisation for dehydration; no deaths. |\n| **Investigation findings** | \u2022 The farm\u2019s milking equipment showed inadequate cleaning between milking sessions. <br>\u2022 Fecal contamination of the bulk tank was identified as the most likely route for the *Campylobacter* to enter the milk. <br>\u2022 The farm had no documented routine testing of raw milk for pathogens (many states do not require it). |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 The farm voluntarily stopped raw\u2011milk sales while corrective actions were taken. <br>\u2022 The state health department issued a public advisory warning consumers about raw\u2011milk risks. <br>\u2022 The CDC added the outbreak to its \u201cFoodborne Outbreak Online Database\u201d (FOOD) and used it as a teaching case for clinicians. |\n\n*Why this matters*: Even a modest\u2011size operation that sells only a few hundred gallons per week can generate an outbreak that spreads across county lines because raw milk is often shared among families, at community events, or used as an ingredient in other foods (e.g., cheese, smoothies). The **average number of illnesses per outbreak** for raw milk in the United States over the last decade is roughly **15\u201120 people**, but some single incidents have affected **dozens to over a hundred** individuals (e.g., the 2012 \u201cStoneham, Massachusetts\u201d outbreak \u2013 70 cases linked to *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7).\n\n---\n\n### How pasteurisation changes the taste of milk\n\n| Factor | Raw milk | Pasteurised milk (typical HTST) | Effect on flavour & mouthfeel |\n|--------|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Heat\u2011sensitive enzymes** (alkaline phosphatase, lactoperoxidase, lipase) | Active; they can continue to break down milk fats and proteins during storage, producing buttery, \u201ccooked\u2011cream\u201d notes. | Inactivated by heating (72\u202f\u00b0C\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202fs). | **Raw milk** may develop a richer, slightly \u201csweet\u2011buttery\u201d flavour after a day of refrigeration because lipase slowly releases free fatty acids. **Pasteurised milk** stays more neutral because those enzymes are dead. |\n| **Microbial metabolism** | Live bacteria (both benign and potentially pathogenic) can produce volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, diacetyl, short\u2011chain fatty acids). | Most bacteria are killed; only a small, controlled starter culture (if milk is later used for cheese or yogurt) can be added later. | Raw milk often has a **\u201cfarm\u2011fresh\u201d** aroma described as \u201ccreamier\u201d or \u201cearthier.\u201d Pasteurised milk is cleaner, with fewer background notes. |\n| **Protein denaturation** | Minimal; casein micelles and whey proteins remain in their native conformation. | A small fraction of whey proteins (\u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin) unfolds at 72\u202f\u00b0C, exposing sulfhydryl groups that can interact with casein. | This can give pasteurised milk a **slightly smoother mouthfeel** and a faint \u201ccooked\u201d flavour that some people notice as \u201cslightly caramelised\u201d or \u201ctoasted.\u201d |\n| **Fat globule size** | May be slightly larger because no heat\u2011induced coalescence. | Heat can cause a modest reduction in average fat\u2011globule size after homogenisation (which is usually done after pasteurisation). | Homogenised, pasteurised milk feels **more uniform** on the tongue; raw milk can feel a bit \u201cgrainier\u201d if the fat globules are larger and not fully emulsified. |\n| **Oxidation of lipids** | Raw milk contains natural antioxidants (e.g., vitamin\u202fE) that slow oxidation, but active lipase can also produce free fatty acids that give a \u201csharp\u201d taste if the milk is stored too long",

The preference is subjective\u2014some people love it, others notice no difference. |\n| **Perceived health benefits** | \u201cRaw milk gives me stronger immunity, fewer allergies, and better digestion.\u201d | \u2022 Small observational studies (mainly from Europe) have found **associations** between raw\u2011milk consumption and lower rates of asthma or atopic dermatitis, but the studies are **confounded** by other farm\u2011related exposures (e.g., dust, animal contact). <br>\u2022 No randomized controlled trials have proven a causal benefit, and the **risk of serious infection outweighs any unproven advantage** for most people. |\n| **Support for local farmers / \u201cfood sovereignty\u201d** | \u201cBuying directly from the farm keeps money in the community and avoids big\u2011corp processing.\u201d | Buying locally can be a legitimate economic choice, but the safety issue is **independent of the supply chain**. Small farms can be very safe *if* they meet strict hygiene and testing standards (see the \u201csafe\u2011if\u2011managed\u2011well\u201d example below). |\n| **Distrust of industrial processing** | \u201cPasteurisation destroys nutrients and adds chemicals.\u201d | Pasteurisation does **destroy a few heat\u2011sensitive nutrients** (vitamin\u202fC, some B\u2011vitamins) but the loss is modest (\u2248\u202f10\u202f% of vitamin\u202fC, negligible for most people). No chemicals are added during the standard HTST process. |\n| **Cultural or traditional practice** | \u201cMy family has been drinking raw milk for generations.\u201d | Tradition can reinforce a belief that \u201cit\u2019s been fine for years,\u201d but past safety is **not a guarantee**\u2014outbreaks can appear suddenly when a new pathogen is introduced or hygiene lapses. |\n| **Desire to avoid \u201cprocessed\u201d foods** | \u201cI want food as close to nature as possible.\u201d | \u201cProcessing\u201d is a neutral term; the purpose of pasteurisation is **risk reduction**, not \u201cindustrial\u2011ization\u201d per se. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The most common reasons are taste, tradition, and the belief that raw milk is \u201cmore natural\u201d or \u201chealthier.\u201d The scientific literature shows that any nutritional advantage is minimal, while the infection risk is *significantly* higher than for pasteurised milk.\n\n---\n\n## When (and how) raw milk can be *relatively* safe \u2013 a concrete example\n\n> **Important disclaimer:** \u201cRelatively safe\u201d does **not** mean \u201crisk\u2011free.\u201d Even under the best commercial\u2011farm conditions, a small chance of pathogenic contamination remains. Public\u2011health agencies therefore continue to advise against raw\u2011milk consumption for the general population.\n\n### The Swiss \u201cRaw\u2011Milk Quality Programme\u201d (RMQP)\n\nSwitzerland is one of the few high\u2011income countries that **legally permits retail sales of raw cow\u2019s milk** (and goat\u2019s milk) **provided the producer follows a nationally\u2011certified programme**. The program illustrates how a raw\u2011milk supply can be managed to keep the risk as low as possible.\n\n| Element of the programme | What the farmer must do | How the step reduces risk |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Herd health monitoring** | \u2022 Mandatory regular veterinary checks for mastitis, Johne\u2019s disease, Brucellosis, Tuberculosis, and *E.\u202fcoli* O157.<br>\u2022 Cows must be free of clinical mastitis for at least 14\u202fdays before milking. | Removes the most common sources of pathogens in the udder. |\n| **Milking\u2011parlour hygiene** | \u2022 Separate \u201craw\u2011milk\u201d line with stainless\u2011steel equipment that is **cleaned and sanitized after each milking session** (validated by ATP\u2011luminescence testing).<br>\u2022 Milkers wear",
