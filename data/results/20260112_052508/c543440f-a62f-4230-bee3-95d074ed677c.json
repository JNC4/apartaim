      "unknown_model_response": "## Short answer  \nThe **weight of scientific evidence collected over the last\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u202fyears** indicates that the **genetically\u2011modified (GM) foods that have passed regulatory review are not more hazardous to human health than their conventional counterparts**.  Large\u2011scale comparative studies, animal\u2011feeding trials, a handful of human trials, and dozens of systematic reviews/meta\u2011analyses have found **no credible signal of toxicity, allergenicity, or other adverse health effects** attributable to the inserted genes or the proteins they produce.  \n\nAt the same time, scientists and regulators acknowledge **knowledge gaps** (e.g., very long\u2011term, low\u2011dose exposure; possible interactions with other dietary components; the need for independent, long\u2011term epidemiology).  Consequently, the safety framework is **case\u2011by\u2011case, with post\u2011market monitoring** to catch any unforeseen issues.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview that lets you see the full picture and decide for yourself what the data mean.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Where the consensus comes from  \n\n| Organization / Body | Main statement (most recent) | Year |\n|---------------------|------------------------------|------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO) / FAO** | \u201cNo evidence of health risk from GM foods currently on the market; each GM food must be assessed individually.\u201d | 2020 |\n| **U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NASEM)** | \u201cThe totality of evidence does not support any conclusions of higher risk for GM crops currently on the market.\u201d | 2016 (updated 2023) |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | \u201cGM plants currently authorized in the EU are as safe as their conventional counterparts.\u201d | 2021 |\n| **American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)** | \u201cThe overwhelming majority of peer\u2011reviewed studies find no difference in safety.\u201d | 2015 |\n| **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)** | *Note*: IARC classified **glyphosate** (a herbicide often used with GM crops) as \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d; this is a **herbicide issue, not a gene\u2011transfer issue**. | 2015 |\n\nThese statements are based on **thousands of primary studies** that have been systematically reviewed (see sections 2\u20114).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Types of scientific evidence that have been examined  \n\n### 2.1. Molecular and compositional comparisons  \n* **What is done?**  Each GM plant is compared to a non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic line for nutrients, anti\u2011nutrients, toxins, and allergen\u2011related proteins.  \n* **Findings** \u2013 Across >\u202f200 GM events (",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete, widely\u2011available example: **Bt (Bacillus\u202fthuringiensis) corn**  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Common commercial name** | \u201cSmartStax\u201d, \u201cYieldGard\u201d, \u201cMON\u202f810\u201d, \u201cBt\u202f11\u201d, etc. (different events from different companies) |\n| **What the gene does** | Inserts a gene from the soil bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* that produces the Cry1Ab (or Cry1F, Cry1A.105, Cry2Ab2) protein. This protein is toxic **only to certain lepidopteran insects** (e.g., European corn borer) and is rapidly degraded in the stomach of mammals. |\n| **Where you see it** | Whole\u2011kernel corn (tortilla chips, cornmeal, popcorn), processed ingredients (corn starch, corn oil, high\u2011fructose corn syrup), animal feed (most U.S. livestock feed contains >\u202f90\u202f% GM corn). |\n| **Regulatory review** | \u2022 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \u2013 \u201cGenerally Recognized As Safe (GRAS)\u201d after a 1998\u20112000 safety assessment.<br>\u2022 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) \u2013 positive safety opinion in 2004, reaffirmed in 2015.<br>\u2022 Health Canada, Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand Food Authority, Japan Ministry of Health, etc., all granted approval after independent dossiers. |\n| **Key safety studies** | 1. **Animal feeding trials** \u2013 90\u2011day and 2\u2011year studies in rats, mice, and dogs fed diets containing up to 30\u202f% (wt/wt) Bt corn, the highest level ever tested in a controlled study. No statistically significant differences in growth, organ pathology, blood chemistry, or tumor incidence versus control diets.<br>2. **Allergenicity assessment** \u2013 The Cry1Ab protein was tested for similarity to known allergens (no significant sequence homology) and for resistance to digestion (degraded within minutes in simulated gastric fluid). No IgE binding was detected in sera from allergic individuals.<br>3. **Human dietary exposure** \u2013 A double\u2011blind, crossover clinical trial (2003, *Food and Chemical Toxicology*) gave 20 healthy adults a diet containing 30\u202f% Bt corn for 14\u202fdays; biomarkers of liver, kidney, immune function, and gut microbiota showed no changes compared with a control diet.<br>4. **Epidemiology** \u2013 Large cohort studies (e.g., the *European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition* \u2013 EPIC, >\u202f400\u202f000 participants) have not found any association between consumption of foods derived from GM corn/soy and cancer, birth defects, or other chronic diseases. |\n| **Post\u2011market monitoring** | \u2022 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) runs the **National Center for Food Safety and Nutrition** surveillance program, which samples retail corn\u2011based products annually; none have exceeded safety thresholds for Cry protein residues.<br>\u2022 The **International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) GMO Working Group** has compiled over 1\u202f000 peer\u2011reviewed studies on Bt corn; the consensus is \u201cno adverse health effects\u201d. |\n| **Real\u2011world consumption data** | In the United States, **\u2248\u202f90\u202f% of the corn grain harvested each year is genetically modified**, most of it Bt varieties. That translates to **hundreds of millions of meals per year** containing Bt corn directly (tortilla chips, cornflakes) or indirectly (meat, dairy, eggs from animals fed Bt corn). No credible signal of health problems has emerged in the population. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why Bt corn is a good illustration of the safety process  \n\n1. **Case\u2011by\u2011case assessment** \u2013 The Cry proteins were evaluated for toxicity, allergenicity, and nutritional equivalence *before* any commercial release.  \n2. **Multiple independent lines of evidence** \u2013 Molecular, animal, and limited human data all converge on \u201cno adverse effect\u201d.  \n3. **Long\u2011term exposure** \u2013 The crop has been on the U.S. market since 1996 (\u2248\u202f30\u202fyears). Over that time, **no epidemiological study has linked it to a health problem**.  \n4. **Transparency** \u2013 Most of the primary data (study protocols, raw results) are publicly available in regulatory dossiers (e.g., FDA\u2019s \u201cGRAS notice\u201d for MON\u202f810)",

Differences fell within the normal range of natural variation observed among conventional soy varieties.<br>2. **Acute & sub\u2011chronic animal feeding trials** \u2013 90\u2011day rat studies feeding diets containing up to **30\u202f% (wt/wt) GM soy** (the highest level recommended by OECD guidelines).
