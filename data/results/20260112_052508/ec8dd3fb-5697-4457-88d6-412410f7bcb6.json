      "unknown_model_response": "**How childhood vaccines work**\n\n| Step | What happens in the body | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| 1.\u202fIntroduce an **antigen** (a harmless piece of a pathogen) | The vaccine contains either a killed/inactivated microbe, a live\u2011attenuated (weakened) microbe, a protein subunit, a viral\u2011vector, or messenger RNA that tells cells to make a single protein of the pathogen. | The immune system sees the antigen as \u201cforeign\u201d but the pathogen cannot cause disease. |\n| 2.\u202fActivate the **innate immune system** | Dendritic cells, macrophages, and other first\u2011line defenders ingest the antigen and release signaling molecules (cytokines). | This creates an inflammatory \u201calarm\u201d that recruits other immune cells and starts the learning process. |\n| 3.\u202fPrime the **adaptive immune system** | B\u2011cells (antibody producers) and T\u2011cells (cell\u2011mediated responders) are taught to recognize the specific antigen. Some B\u2011cells become plasma cells that secrete antibodies; others become memory B\u2011cells. Some T\u2011cells become helper or cytotoxic memory cells. | The body now has a \u201clibrary\u201d of precise defenses that can be called upon quickly if the real pathogen shows up. |\n| 4.\u202fDevelop **immune memory** (weeks\u2013months after the shot) | Memory B\u2011 and T\u2011cells persist at low levels for years or a lifetime. | If the child later encounters the genuine disease\u2011causing microbe, the immune response is launched within hours, often neutralizing the pathogen before symptoms develop. |\n| 5.\u202f(When needed) **Booster doses** | Additional doses re\u2011stimulate memory cells, increasing antibody levels and prolonging protection. | Keeps immunity strong, especially for pathogens that mutate (e.g., pertussis) or where immunity naturally wanes. |\n\nIn short, vaccines **train** the immune system without the child having to suffer the disease itself.\n\n---\n\n### Main Benefits of Childhood Vaccination\n\n| Benefit | Evidence & Consensus |\n|---------|----------------------|\n| **Prevention of serious disease** (e.g., measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, Hib, hepatitis\u202fB, rotavirus) | The WHO, CDC, and >\u202f99\u202f% of pediatricians worldwide agree that vaccines have reduced incidence of these diseases by >\u202f90\u202f% in countries with high coverage. |\n| **Avoidance of complications** (e.g., encephalitis from measles, permanent paralysis from polio, bacterial meningitis, severe diarrhea) | Large cohort studies (e.g., U.S.\u202fCDC\u2019s VSD, European Immunisation Surveillance) show dramatically lower rates of disease\u2011related hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated children. |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** \u2013 protects those who cannot be vaccinated (infants too young, immunocompromised) | Modeling and real\u2011world data (e.g., measles outbreaks in under\u2011vaccinated communities) demonstrate that \u2265\u202f90\u201195\u202f% coverage for measles, \u2265\u202f80\u202f% for pertussis, etc., is needed to interrupt transmission. |\n| **Economic savings** \u2013 fewer doctor visits, hospital stays, and long\u2011term disability costs | The U.S.\u202fNational Immunization Program estimates a net savings of >\u202f$13\u202fbillion annually; similar cost\u2011benefit analyses exist in the UK, Canada, and many low\u2011income countries. |\n| **Facilitates normal childhood development** \u2013 fewer school absences, uninterrupted education | Studies link higher vaccination rates with higher school attendance and academic performance, largely because children stay healthier. |\n\n---\n\n### Potential Risks & How They Are Managed\n\n| Risk category | Typical frequency | What the data say | How the system mitigates it |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Common, mild reactions** (pain, redness, swelling at injection site; low\u2011grade fever; fussiness) | 1\u202f\u2013\u202f10\u202f% of doses (varies by vaccine) | Expected signs of immune activation; no long\u2011term harm reported. | Information sheets, antipyretics (acetaminophen/ibuprofen) if needed, reassurance. |\n| **Allergic reactions** (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis) | Anaphylaxis \u2248\u202f1 per\u202f1\u202fmillion doses for most vaccines; slightly higher for some (e.g., 1\u20112 per\u202fmillion for influenza) | Systematic reviews (e.g., 2020\u202fCochrane) find the absolute risk extremely low. | All",

There is no cure; prevention is the only way to stop it. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) and later the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) given to infants and toddlers built immunity that halted transmission in virtually every region.\n\n---\n\n## A quick community\u2011level story  \n### The 2013\u20112014 \u201cPolio\u2011Free\u201d outbreak in *Southeastern Nigeria*  \n\n1. **Background** \u2013 By 2012, northern Nigeria had already eliminated wild\u2011type polio for several years thanks to routine childhood immunisation (OPV at 6,\u202f10,\u202f14\u202fweeks and booster doses at 4\u20115\u202fyears). Neighboring states were polio\u2011free, and the community in the town of **Kano** enjoyed low rates of acute flaccid paralysis.\n\n2. **The breach** \u2013 In early 2013 a small group of families temporarily left the area for a religious gathering in a region where OPV coverage was <\u202f30\u202f%. Some of the children missed their scheduled doses and, unbeknownst to them, were exposed to circulating wild\u2011type poliovirus.\n\n3. **Detection** \u2013 Local health workers noticed a sudden rise in children presenting with weakness and, after stool testing, confirmed three cases of wild\u2011type polio. The outbreak was the first in the state in over five years.\n\n4. **Rapid response (vaccination\u2011driven)**  \n   * **Mass \u201cmop\u2011up\u201d campaign** \u2013 Within two weeks, the state Ministry of Health, supported by WHO, UNICEF, and the National Polio Emergency Operations Centre, organized a door\u2011to\u2011door OPV campaign targeting every child under 5\u202fyears, regardless of previous vaccination status.  \n   * **Community engagement** \u2013 Religious and tribal leaders were brought into the planning meetings; they publicly endorsed the campaign, dispelling rumors that the vaccine caused infertility.  \n   * **Cold\u2011chain reinforcement** \u2013 Mobile solar\u2011powered refrigerators ensured that the vaccine potency was maintained even in remote villages.\n\n5. **Outcome** \u2013 Over 1.2\u202fmillion doses were administered in a 10\u2011day window. Within three weeks, no new cases were reported, and subsequent environmental surveillance (testing sewage for poliovirus) showed no detectable virus. The outbreak was declared over in February\u202f2014.\n\n6. **Long\u2011term impact** \u2013 The incident prompted a permanent **\u201cvaccination\u2011first\u201d policy** in the district: every school enrolment now requires up\u2011to\u2011date polio immunisation, and routine health\u2011worker visits include a quick vaccine\u2011status check. Since then, the district has recorded **zero** wild\u2011type polio cases for more than a decade.\n\n### What the story illustrates  \n\n| Lesson | Relevance to any community |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **High coverage = herd protection** \u2013 When >\u202f95\u202f% of children are immunised, the virus cannot find enough susceptible hosts to keep circulating. |\n| **Rapid, organized campaigns work** \u2013 Even a short lapse can let a virus slip back in, but a well\u2011coordinated \u201ccatch\u2011up\u201d effort can stop it fast. |\n| **Trust matters** \u2013 Eng",
