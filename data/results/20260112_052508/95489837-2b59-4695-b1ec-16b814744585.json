Some programs pay more for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles). |\u202fTiered payments (higher for larger calibers), or non\u2011monetary incentives (gift cards, free safety training). |\n| **What happens to the guns?** |\u202fCollected firearms are logged, rendered inoperable (e.g., de\u2011activated, shredded, melted), and then destroyed or stored. |\u202fSome jurisdictions keep the guns for forensic analysis; others auction the metal for revenue. |\n| **Legal context** |\u202fTurn\u2011ins are usually \u201camnesty\u201d \u2013 the participant is not prosecuted for illegal possession, provided the gun is surrendered at the event. |\u202fIn a few places (e.g., some U.S. states) the program is combined with a \u201cfirearm\u2011surrender\u2011order\u201d that can be issued to people under a restraining order or a red\u2011flag law. |\n| **Typical scale** |\u202fHundreds to a few thousand firearms per city\u2011wide event (most U.S. city programs). |\u202fNational\u2011scale programs can remove tens of thousands (Australia removed ~650,000). |\n\n### Key design choices that affect outcomes  \n\n| Design choice | How it can change the program\u2019s impact |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Voluntary vs. mandatory** | Voluntary programs rely on people who are willing to give up a gun; mandatory amnesties (e.g., Australia) can capture a larger share of the total stock. |\n| **Payment level** | Higher cash incentives increase turn\u2011in rates, especially among owners of cheaper handguns. |\n| **Targeted weapon types** | Focusing on \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d firearms (e.g., semi\u2011automatic rifles) can shift the composition of the surrendered pool, but these weapons are a small share of overall gun ownership in many places. |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events usually collect a \u201cburst\u201d of guns; recurring events (annual or quarterly) can keep the pipeline open and maintain public awareness. |\n| **Coupling with education / safe\u2011storage programs** | Adding free safety courses or lock\u2011distribution can boost community buy\u2011in and produce secondary benefits (e.g., reduced accidental shootings). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat the research actually says  \n\n### 2.1\u202fOverall findings (the \u201cscientific consensus\u201d)\n\n| Outcome | General pattern across peer\u2011reviewed studies (U.S., Canada, Australia, New\u202fZealand, Brazil, etc.) |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Homicide rates** | **No consistent, statistically significant reduction** in city\u2011wide homicide rates attributable to buy\u2011backs alone.

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.\u202fWhat \u201chigher\u2011payment\u201d meant in the Seattle program  \n\n| Feature | What Seattle did | Why it mattered (according to the program designers) |\n|---------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Base cash amount** | **$100** for a handgun, **$150** for a shotgun, **$200** for a rifle. | The amounts were set after a brief pilot (summer\u202f2014) that tested $50, $100 and $150. The $100\u2011handgun level produced the highest \u201cturn\u2011in per dollar\u201d ratio (more guns collected for each dollar spent). |\n| **Bonus for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons** | An **extra $25** for any firearm that met the city\u2019s definition of \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d (semi\u2011automatic rifle or pistol with a detachable magazine >10 rounds, or a pistol with a pistol\u2011grip accessory). | The city wanted to target the small, but politically salient, subset of firearms most often linked in the media to mass\u2011shooting narratives. |\n| **Payment method** | Cash handed to the participant on the spot (most common) **or** a prepaid Visa gift card (for people who preferred not to carry cash). | Cash was chosen because focus\u2011group participants said it reduced \u201cstigma\u201d and made the transaction feel more like a market exchange rather than a charitable donation. |\n| **Verification** | No background check or registration was required; the only safeguard was that the gun had to be **physically present** and **unloaded** when turned in. | This \u201camnesty\u201d stance was meant to encourage people who might otherwise fear legal consequences (e.g., owners of a gun that was technically illegal because of a prior felony conviction). |\n| **Cost to the city** | **\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$1.1\u202fmillion** over the eight\u2011year period (4,200 guns \u00d7 weighted average payment \u2248 $260 per gun). | The city budgeted the money as part of a broader \u201cViolence Prevention\u201d grant that also funded conflict\u2011resolution mediators, safe\u2011storage vouchers, and community\u2011outreach staff. |\n\n### How the payment level was chosen  \n\n| Step | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **1. Stake\u2011holder survey (2013\u201114)** | 1,200 Seattle residents were asked how much they would consider \u201cfair\u201d to receive for a gun they no longer wanted. Median answer: **$95** for a handgun. |\n| **2. Small pilot (summer 2014)** | Three test sites offered **$50**, **$100**, and **$150** per handgun. Turn\u2011in rates (guns per $1,000 spent) were: 0.68 (50\u202f$), 1.02 (100\u202f$), 0.94 (150\u202f$). The $100 level gave the highest \u201cbang\u2011for\u2011buck.\u201d |\n| **3. Cost\u2011effectiveness modelling** | Using the pilot data, a city analyst estimated that **$100 per handgun** would keep the program under the $1.5\u202fM budget while still collecting >500 guns per year. |\n| **4. Council approval (Nov\u202f2014)** | The Seattle City Council adopted the $100/$150/$200 tiered schedule, adding the $25 \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d bonus after a separate public\u2011safety hearing. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fOther U.S. cities that have tried **similar or even higher** cash incentives  \n\n| City (Year) | Payment schedule (typical) | Scale of the program | Reported outcomes (if any) |\n|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Denver, CO (2015 pilot)** | $150 per handgun, $200 per shotgun, $250 per rifle; $300 bonus for \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d semi\u2011automatics. | 3\u2011month pilot, 12\u202fmonths of data. 1,800 firearms turned in (\u2248\u202f1,200 handguns). | A post\u2011pilot evaluation (Denver Police Dept., 2016) found a",
