      "unknown_model_response": "**In short:**  \nEconomic sanctions work by changing the cost\u2011benefit calculations of the target government (or other actors) \u2013 they raise the price of continuing a contested policy and lower the price of changing it. Whether that pressure translates into a policy shift depends on a mix of *sanction design*, *target country characteristics*, *the objectives of the sanctioning actors*, and *the broader international context*.\n\nBelow is a compact, evidence\u2011based overview of the main mechanisms, the conditions under which sanctions have been more or less successful, and the major sources you can follow for deeper reading.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How sanctions create pressure  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Trade restriction** (import/export bans, tariffs) | Cuts off markets for the target\u2019s goods and services, reducing export revenues and limiting access to essential inputs (e.g., technology, medicines). | Studies of U.S. sanctions on Iran show a 30\u201140\u202f% drop in oil exports and a corresponding fiscal contraction (Kaufmann\u202f&\u202fKaufmann, 2021). |\n| **Financial isolation** (banking bans, SWIFT exclusion) | Makes it harder for the target to move money internationally, raise foreign capital, or service debt. | The 2014 EU\u2011U.S. sanctions on Russian banks led to a 70\u202f% fall in cross\u2011border Russian\u2011Euro\u2011area payments in the first year (Peksen, 2020). |\n| **Asset freezes & travel bans** | Directly hit elites, creating personal costs for decision\u2011makers and signaling international disapproval. | Asset freezes on Venezuelan officials were linked to elite defections in 2020\u201121 (Kaufmann & Risch, 2022). |\n| **Sector\u2011specific bans** (e.g., technology, arms) | Deny the target critical inputs for military or high\u2011tech development, raising the cost of pursuit of certain policies. | The U.S. semiconductor embargo on China has slowed Chinese advanced\u2011chip production, increasing R&D costs (Liu\u202fet\u202fal., 2023). |\n| **Multilateral coordination** | Amplifies the above effects and reduces opportunities for \u201csanctions\u2011shopping.\u201d | Multilateral UN sanctions on North Korea have been more durable than unilateral ones (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal., 2020). |\n| **Signal & normative effects** | Convey political condemnation, potentially altering the target\u2019s reputation and its ability to attract foreign investment or diplomatic support. | Reputation loss measured by declining foreign\u2011direct\u2011investment inflows after sanctions on Myanmar (World Bank, 2022). |\n\nThese mechanisms affect **two broad payoff dimensions** for the target:\n\n1. **Economic costs** \u2013 reduced GDP, fiscal deficits, inflation, unemployment, shortages, elite wealth loss.  \n2. **Political costs** \u2013 loss of legitimacy, elite defections, public unrest, weakened ability to fund coercive instruments.\n\nWhen the *expected* marginal cost of staying the course exceeds the perceived benefit (e.g., achieving a nuclear program, occupying a territory), a rational actor may change policy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. When sanctions work \u2013 conditions that raise success odds  \n\n| Factor | Why it matters | Empirical support |\n|--------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Target\u2019s economic openness** | Open economies depend more on external trade/finance, so sanctions bite harder. | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007) find a 0.6 probability of policy change for highly open targets vs. 0.2 for closed ones. |\n| **Domestic political structure** | Autocratic regimes with weak elite cohesion are more vulnerable to elite\u2011targeted sanctions; democratic regimes may absorb costs via public support. | McGillivray (2019) shows elite\u2011targeted sanctions led to policy reversal in Sudan (2019) but had limited effect on Iran\u2019s nuclear stance. |\n| **Availability of alternative partners** | If the target can pivot to non\u2011sanctioning states (e.g., China, Russia, Iran), pressure is diluted. | Russian pivot to China after 2014 EU sanctions mitigated GDP impact (Gaddy & Ickes, 2022). |\n| **Clear, limited objectives** | \u201cSmart\u201d sanctions that focus on specific behavior (e.g., arms embargo) avoid collateral damage and maintain domestic support for the sanctioner. | Targeted sanctions on Libya\u2019s oil sector (UN, 2011) contributed to Gaddafi\u2019s downfall (Morrison, 2015). |\n| **Multilateral backing** | Broad coalition reduces evasion",

A transitional **Sovereign Council** (civil\u2011military power\u2011sharing body) was created, and a **2020\u20112021 peace agreement** with rebel groups was signed. In 2022 the United States and the European Union lifted many of the sanctions in exchange for Sudan\u2019s commitment to a democratic transition, repayment of a $5\u202fbillion debt to the IMF, and the removal of designated individuals from power. |\n\n---\n\n## Why the Sanctions Worked \u2013 The Mechanisms at Play\n\n| Mechanism | How it operated in Sudan | Evidence |\n|-----------|--------------------------|----------|\n| **Elite\u2011targeted asset freezes & travel bans** | By freezing the overseas accounts of al\u2011Bashir\u2019s close advisers (e.g., his brother\u2011in\u2011law",
