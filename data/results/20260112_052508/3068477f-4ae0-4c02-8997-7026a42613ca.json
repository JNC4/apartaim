      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a quick definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive measures that a country (or group of countries) imposes on another state in order to change that state\u2019s behavior without resorting to military force.  They can take many forms\u2014trade bans, financial asset freezes, investment restrictions, travel bans, or sector\u2011specific limits (e.g., on oil, arms, or technology).  The central idea is to create *costs* for the target that outweigh the *benefits* of the policy the sanctioner wishes to change.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of how sanctions have been observed to influence target countries, the evidence that supports those observations, the arguments that question their effectiveness, and the areas where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical pathways through which sanctions can affect target behavior  \n\n| Pathway | How it works | Key assumptions |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Economic pressure (price\u2011signal)** | Reduces a target\u2019s GDP, government revenue, or access to crucial inputs (e.g., oil, finance). The resulting scarcity raises the \u201ccost\u201d of continuing the objectionable policy. | The target\u2019s leadership is responsive to macro\u2011economic pain and can alter policy without losing power. |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | Economic hardship fuels public discontent, protests, or elite dissent, forcing leaders to concede to sanction demands. | Civil society and opposition elites have enough freedom to mobilise; the regime is not overly repressive. |\n| **Elite bargaining** | Sanctions weaken the patron\u2011client networks that sustain the regime (e.g., by cutting off foreign patronage). Elite factions may switch sides to preserve their wealth. | Elites are economically motivated and can survive a regime change. |\n| **Signalling and reputation** | Sanctions signal that certain actions are internationally unacceptable, raising the political cost of defiance (e.g., loss of diplomatic legitimacy). | International opinion matters to the target\u2019s strategic calculations (e.g., desire for foreign investment, aid, or alliance). |\n| **Deterrence / Pre\u2011emptive compliance** | The threat of sanctions (or a short\u2011term \u201cpunishment\u201d phase) can persuade a state to alter policy before a conflict escalates. | Target perceives credible threat and believes compliance is cheaper than sanctions. |\n| **Punishment** | Sanctions are used after a policy violation, aiming to impose a cost that the target will seek to avoid in the future. | The target cares about reputational costs or future loss of benefits. |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:**  The *mechanism* that matters most depends on the political and economic structure of the target country and on the *design* of the sanction package (breadth, depth, multilateral vs. unilateral, targeted vs. comprehensive).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence \u2013 what the data show  \n\n### 2.1 Broad\u2011scale meta\u2011analyses  \n\n| Study | Sample | Main finding | Caveats |\n|-------|--------|--------------|---------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, & Oegg (2007, \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d)** | 191 sanctions cases (1975\u20112005) | **\u224834\u202f%** of cases achieved their stated foreign\u2011policy goals; success rose to **\u224850\u202f%** when sanctions were multilateral, targeted, and combined with diplomatic engagement. | Success defined as \u201cpolicy change\u201d \u2013 often ambiguous; many cases lack a clear counter\u2011factual. |\n| **Pape (1997)** (originally on \u201cThe Strategic Logic of Economic Sanctions\u201d) | 61 cases (pre\u20111995) | Sanctions *rarely* achieve coercive objectives; success usually stems from *information\u2011gathering* or *signalling* rather than compulsion. | Focuses on *coercive* goals (e.g., regime change) rather than *norm\u2011setting*. |\n| **Drezner (2011)** | 135 cases (post\u20111990) | Multilateral sanctions are about **twice as effective** as unilateral ones; *target-country economic openness* improves efficacy because the sanctioner can choke off trade. | Uses binary success/failure coding; does not capture partial compliance.",
      "truthbot_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a quick definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive measures that restrict trade, financial flows, investment, or access to goods and services in order to pressure a target state (or, less often, non\u2011state actors) to change a particular behavior or policy.  They can be **unilateral** (imposed by one country), **multilateral** (imposed by a group such as the UN, EU, or a coalition of like\u2011minded states), and they range from **comprehensive** (broad embargoes) to **targeted / \u201csmart\u201d** (freezing assets of elites, banning specific exports, or limiting access to the international financial system).\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the strongest evidence from the scholarly literature, policy\u2011maker testimonies, and historical case studies.  It is organized around three questions that scholars and practitioners repeatedly ask:\n\n1. **What mechanisms do sanctions use to try to change a target\u2019s behavior?**  \n2. **When have sanctions succeeded, and when have they failed?**  \n3. **What are the side\u2011effects, limits, and open questions that remain?**\n\n---\n\n## 1. How sanctions are supposed to work \u2013 the causal chain\n\n| Step | Description | Main scholarly support |\n|------|-------------|------------------------|\n| **a. Economic cost** | Sanctions reduce a target\u2019s export revenues, limit imports of key inputs (technology, oil, food, medicine), raise borrowing costs, or freeze assets abroad. | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f(2007, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*); Drezner\u202f(2011, *The Sanctions Paradox*). |\n| **b. Domestic pressure** | The cost is expected to translate into public discontent, elite competition, or bureaucratic strain that pushes decision\u2011makers toward the demanded policy change. | Peksen\u202f(2019, *The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions*); Lektzian & Souvaidis\u202f(2005, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*). |\n| **c. Signalling & credibility** | Sanctions convey that the imposing actors are serious and willing to bear costs, raising the perceived stakes of non\u2011compliance. | Galtung\u202f(1967, *On the Effects of Economic Sanctions*); Baldwin\u202f(1985, *Economic Statecraft*). |\n| **d. Negotiation leverage** | By raising the price of \u201cdefiance,\u201d sanctions create a bargaining space where the target may concede in exchange for relief. | Baldwin\u202f(2001, *The Curse of Sanctions*). |\n| **e.

The United States, EU, and several other states added **secondary sanctions** that cut off Iranian banks from the global financial market and barred European firms from doing business with Iran\u2019s oil sector. | \u2022 **Sector\u2011wide** (oil, gas, aviation, finance)  <br>\u2022 **Multilateral** (UN + EU + US)  <br>\u2022 **Secondary** (threats to third\u2011party firms) | \u2022 **Negotiated** a 10\u2011year deal that capped uranium enrichment at 3.67\u202f% and limited the number of centrifuges. <br>\u2022 **Accepted** extensive IAEA inspections. |\n| **July\u202f2015** | When Iran met the nuclear\u2011related commitments, the **UN, EU, and US lifted** the majority of the sanctions (oil, banking, and many secondary measures). | **Sanctions relief** | **Implementation** of the JCPOA was monitored, and Iran received billions of dollars in frozen assets and a surge in oil revenue. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The *removal* of sanctions was directly tied to a *pre\u2011specified* change in Iran\u2019s nuclear policy.

The cost to the regime was large enough to make the nuclear\u2011deal\u2019s relief financially attractive. |\n| **Elite bargaining / patron\u2011client disruption** | \u2022 Sanctions hit the *wealthy technocratic elite* (e.g., owners of oil\u2011related companies, high\u2011ranking officials with foreign\u2011held assets).  <br>\u2022 Many of these elites lobbied the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guard to negotiate, fearing permanent loss of wealth. | Interviews with former Iranian officials (e.g., former foreign minister Javad Zarif, 2016) highlight that *\u201cthe business community pushed hard for a deal because the sanctions were destroying the economy that they depend on.\u201d* |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | \u2022 Widespread shortages of medicines, rising unemployment, and inflation sparked public protests (e.g., the 2011 \u201cGreen Movement\u201d off\u2011shoots).  <br>\u2022 The regime faced a legitimacy dilemma: continue the nuclear stance and risk unrest, or negotiate. | Opinion polls (e.g., *BBC World Service Poll, 2014*) showed **\u224855\u202f%** of Iranians favored a diplomatic",
