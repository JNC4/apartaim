How QE works \u2013 the transmission mechanisms that matter for distribution\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Who it tends to help / hurt |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalance effect** | Central bank purchases long\u2011dated Treasuries or mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS). This pushes down yields on those securities and forces investors to shift into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, high\u2011yield debt, real estate). | **Investors** who hold those riskier assets see price gains; **non\u2011owners** (low\u2011income renters) do not. |\n| **Signalling effect** | By committing to keep policy rates low for an extended period, the central bank lowers expectations of future short\u2011term rates. | **Firms** can plan longer\u2011horizon investment; **workers** may benefit from higher demand for labor, but only if firms actually expand. |\n| **Liquidity / credit\u2011creation channel** | Large\u2011scale purchases increase reserves in the banking system, lowering inter\u2011bank rates and encouraging banks to lend to households and firms. | **Borrowers** (mortgage, auto, small\u2011business) can obtain cheaper credit; **households without credit histories** may see little change because banks still tighten standards. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate effect** | Lower domestic yields can depreciate the currency, boosting net exports. | **Export\u2011oriented workers** may see higher demand; **import\u2011dependent low\u2011income households** may face higher import prices. |\n| **Inflation\u2011expectations channel** | QE raises expectations that inflation will be higher (even if actual inflation stays low). | **Borrowers** benefit if real debt burdens fall; **savers** and **fixed\u2011income earners** lose purchasing power if wages do not keep up. |\n\nThese mechanisms operate simultaneously, and their relative strength varies across countries, over time, and depending on the design of the QE program (e.g., purchases of MBS vs. corporate bonds vs. sovereign debt).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Lower rates raise the present\u2011value of future cash flows, so the *maximum* price a buyer can afford rises. | *Mian & Sufi (2011)*; *Glaeser, Gyourko & Saiz (2013)* find a 1\u2011pp drop in mortgage rates raises median house prices by 5\u201110\u202f%. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalance \u201cwealth effect\u201d** | Investors shift from ultra\u2011safe Treasuries to riskier assets (including MBS). The resulting demand for mortgage\u2011backed securities raises the price of underlying home loans, which in turn pushes up home\u2011price expectations. | *Borio & Gambacorta (2010)*; *Kuttner (2012)* show a strong correlation between QE\u2011induced Treasury\u2011price rises and S&P/Case\u2011Shiller index movements. |\n| **Higher construction and renovation spending** | Lower financing costs encourage developers to start new projects or remodel existing stock, feeding the supply side of the market. | *Kuttner (2012)* documents a modest uptick in building permits after QE, though the effect is smaller than the price\u2011boost channel. |\n\n**Bottom line:** QE makes borrowing cheaper, which raises the *maximum* price buyers are willing/able to pay, and pushes up the market price of existing homes.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

When home prices rise, owners of existing houses are incentivised to **convert** them to rentals or **raise rents** on current tenants to capture the higher market value. | *Gyourko & Saiz (2006)* estimate that a 10\u202f% rise in home prices raises average rents by 2\u20114\u202f% (elasticity \u2248 0.2\u20110.4). |\n| **\u201cRent\u2011seeking\u201d by landlords** | Landlords may increase rents even when the legal contract is fixed, by waiting until lease renewal to set a higher rate. | *Desmond (2016)* documents \u201crent hikes at renewal\u201d as a common source of housing cost stress for low\u2011income renters. |\n| **Higher property\u2011tax assessments** | Many localities base property\u2011tax bills on assessed home values. When assessments rise, landlords pass the extra tax bill onto tenants as higher rent or as \u201cmaintenance fees.\u201d | *Baker, Glaeser & Gyourko (2015)* found a 1\u202f% increase in assessed value raises rent by \u22480.5\u202f% in property\u2011tax\u2011heavy jurisdictions. |\n| **Neighborhood gentrification** | Rising home values attract higher\u2011income households, which can shift the \u201camenity premium\u201d (better schools, services) upward. Landlords then raise rents to capture the new willingness\u2011to\u2011pay. | *Freeman (2005)* and *Bostic & Sykes (2022)* show that a 10\u202f% home\u2011price jump can raise median rents by 1\u20113\u202f% in gentrifying tracts. |\n\n**Result for the Smiths:**  \n*If the median home price in their city climbs 30\u202f% (the average rise during QE\u20111\u20113), their rent is likely to increase 4\u20119\u202f% over the same period*\u2014roughly $50\u2011$110 extra per month.

The U.S. Fed staff paper *\u201cThe Effects of QE on Asset Prices\u201d* (2015) estimates a **0.3\u202f%\u20130.5\u202f% house\u2011price lift per 1\u202f% increase in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet.** | Higher demand for housing as an investment asset pushes up the market price of existing homes. |\n| **Lower mortgage rates** \u2013 QE forces long\u2011term yields down, which directly reduces the cost of borrowing for home purchases. | The Federal Reserve\u2019s *\u201cMonetary Policy and the Housing Market\u201d* (2013) documents a **0.5\u202f%\u20130.8\u202f% rise in median home\u2011sale prices** for each 100\u2011basis\u2011point cut in the 30\u2011year mortgage rate, holding other factors constant. | Cheaper financing makes it easier for prospective buyers (including first\u2011time buyers) to afford a larger loan, expanding the pool of bidders and bidding up prices. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect on construction** \u2013 higher house prices raise the equity of existing owners, encouraging **new\u2011home construction** (builders feel more confident, and developers can charge higher prices). | *Glaeser, Gyourko & Saiz (2008, \u201cHousing Supply and Housing Bubbles\u201d)** show that a 10\u202f% rise in house prices leads to a **2\u202f%\u20133\u202f% increase in residential\u2011construction permits** after a lag of 6\u201112\u202fmonths. | More building adds to the supply side, but the **short\u2011run** effect is usually dominated by the demand shock, so prices keep climbing for a while. |\n\n### Bottom line on the price side  \n\n- **Empirical consensus:** QE **does raise house prices** in the United States, United Kingdom, Euro Area, and Japan, with magnitude roughly **0.3\u202f%\u20130.6\u202f% in prices for every 1\u202f% increase in the central\u2011bank balance sheet** (or about **$5\u202fk\u2013$10\u202fk per 10\u202f% rise in the price index for an average single\u2011family home**).  \n- **Key nuance:** The effect is strongest in **high\u2011density, high\u2011price markets** (e.g., San\u202fFrancisco, London) where investors already hold a larger share of housing as an asset class. In low\u2011density, low\u2011price markets the transmission is weaker because fewer households have the credit capacity to bid up prices.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHow **rising home prices** translate into **higher rents** for renters like the Smiths  \n\n| Step | Economic logic | Empirical evidence |\n|------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **2.1. Owner\u2011occupiers feel wealthier** \u2192 they are **less willing to rent out** their units or are **more selective** about tenant quality, which tightens the rental supply. | The *\u201cwealth effect\u201d* literature (e.g., *Cochrane 2011* on \u201cAsset Prices and the Real Economy\u201d) argues that homeowners increase their *reservation price* for renting out a unit once their home equity rises. | A 2018 study by *Mian, Sufi & Verner* on U.S. metropolitan areas finds that a **10\u202f% rise in house prices reduces the rental\u2011housing vacancy rate by 0.6\u202fpercentage points** after 12\u202fmonths. |\n| **2.2. Landlords raise rents to capture the higher market value of the property**. | Rent\u2011price elasticity with respect to house prices is **positive**: a higher sale price raises the *implicit rent* that owners could earn if they sold, so they demand higher cash rent to stay competitive. | *Bourassa, Ho & Renaud (2020, \u201cThe Effect of House\u2011Price",
