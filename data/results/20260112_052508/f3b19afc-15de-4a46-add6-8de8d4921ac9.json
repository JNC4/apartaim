      "unknown_model_response": "## How Pasteurisation Works \u2013 the science behind \u201cheat\u2011treated\u201d milk  \n\n### 1.  What pasteurisation is meant to achieve  \n\n| Goal | How it is measured |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Inactivate (kill or severely damage) the microorganisms that can cause disease** | Reduce the *most heat\u2011resistant* pathogenic bacteria to a level that makes a serving of milk safe for the whole population, including infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised people. |\n| **Preserve the sensory and nutritional qualities that make milk useful as a food** | Use the *minimum* heat exposure that still meets the microbiological safety target, so that proteins, fats, sugars and most vitamins stay essentially unchanged. |\n\nPasteurisation is therefore a **controlled heat\u2011treatment**: a specific temperature\u2011time combination that gives a predictable, reproducible level of microbial kill while limiting damage to the milk\u2019s constituents.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  The two most common commercial regimes  \n\n| Regime (named after the scientist who described it) | Typical time\u2011temperature pair | Log\u2011reduction target | Typical use |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| **High\u2011Temperature Short\u2011Time (HTST)** \u2013 \u201cflash pasteurisation\u201d | **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs** (sometimes 71.7\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) | \u2265\u202f5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 reduction of *Coxiella burnetii* (the most heat\u2011resistant pathogen in milk) | The overwhelming majority of retail fluid milk in the U.S., EU, Canada, Australia, etc. |\n| **Low\u2011Temperature Long\u2011Time (LTLT)** \u2013 \u201cbatch pasteurisation\u201d | **63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin** | Same \u2265\u202f5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 reduction of *C. burnetii* | Small\u2011scale dairies, some cheese\u2011making operations, and home\u2011scale pasteurisers. |\n| **Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temperature (UHT)** \u2013 \u201csterilisation\u201d | **135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs** (often 140\u202f\u00b0C for 4\u202fs) | \u2265\u202f6\u202flog\u2081\u2080 reduction of *C. burnetii* and most spores; shelf\u2011stable for months | Milk sold in aseptic cartons (UHT milk) and many dairy powders. |\n\n*Why the focus on **Coxiella burnetii**?*  \nIt is the **most heat\u2011resistant** bacterial pathogen known to survive in raw milk. If a process can reliably inactivate *C. burnetii*, it will also inactivate the far less\u2011resistant culprits such as *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes* and *Campylobacter*.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  The microbiology behind the kill\u2011curve  \n\n#### 3.1.  Thermal death kinetics  \n\n- **D\u2011value** \u2013 the time (at a given temperature) needed to reduce a microbial population by one log (i.e., 90\u202f% kill).  \n  - Example: *C. burnetii* D\u2011value at 63\u202f\u00b0C \u2248 **15\u202fmin**; at 72\u202f\u00b0C it drops to **\u2248\u202f0.2\u202fmin** (\u2248\u202f12\u202fs).  \n\n- **Z\u2011value** \u2013 the temperature increase needed to cut the D\u2011value by a factor of ten.  \n  - For many milk pathogens, Z \u2248 **5\u20137\u202f\u00b0C**.\n\nUsing these constants, the HTST regimen (72\u202f\u00b0C, 15\u202fs) delivers roughly **5\u20136\u202flog** reductions of *C. burnetii* (15\u202fs \u2248 75\u202f% of its D\u2011value at that temperature, multiplied by the log\u2011kill factor). The same reduction would require **\u2248\u202f75\u202fmin** at 63\u202f\u00b0C, which is why LTLT uses a 30\u2011minute hold (still enough for a 5\u2011log kill because the D\u2011value for *C. burnetii* at 63\u202f\u00b0C is a little lower than the textbook value; commercial validation data",
