It is connected to the core network by fiber or microwave backhaul. | \u2022 **Sub\u20116\u202fGHz** (e.g., 600\u202fMHz, 2.5\u202fGHz, 3.5\u202fGHz) \u2013 the same general range used for 4G/LTE.<br>\u2022 **mmWave** (24\u202fGHz\u201340\u202fGHz, sometimes up to 100\u202fGHz) \u2013 higher\u2011frequency \u201cmillimeter\u2011wave\u201d bands that carry large data rates but travel only short distances. | The **effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP)** is limited by national regulations. In the U.S. the FCC permits up to\u202f1\u202fkW EIRP for sub\u20116\u202fGHz and up to\u202f200\u202fW EIRP for many mmWave bands; in Europe the limits are lower (\u2248\u202f200\u202fW EIRP for sub\u20116\u202fGHz, \u2264\u202f40\u202fW for mmWave). The actual output of any given antenna is usually a fraction of the legal maximum because the network is designed to cover only the needed area. |\n| **Antenna array** | Modern 5G sites use **multiple, electronically steerable \u201cphased\u2011array\u201d antennas**. They can form many narrow beams that are dynamically aimed at individual users, instead of broadcasting a single wide\u2011area signal. | Same as the base\u2011station frequency. | Beamforming concentrates power only in the direction of a device, which reduces average exposure for by\u2011standers. |\n| **Small cells** | In dense urban areas, operators supplement macro\u2011towers with **\u201csmall cells\u201d** (often mounted on street furniture, lampposts, or building sides). They operate at lower power (typically a few watts) and fill coverage gaps, especially for mmWave. | Mostly mmWave (24\u201128\u202fGHz) but also sub\u20116\u202fGHz (e.g., 3.5\u202fGHz). | \u2264\u202f10\u202fW EIRP (often far below the regulatory ceiling). |\n| **Backhaul** | Connects the tower to the core network. May be fiber, microwave, or satellite. | Not a health\u2011relevant RF source for the public. | \u2013 |\n\n### How the system delivers data\n\n1. **Device \u2194\ufe0f Tower** \u2013 The handset and the nearest antenna exchange data using **time\u2011division duplex (TDD)** or **frequency\u2011division duplex (FDD)**.  \n2. **Beamforming** \u2013 The antenna array creates a focused beam that tracks the moving device. When the device moves, the beam \u201csteers\u201d electronically in milliseconds.  \n3. **Network density** \u2013 5G\u2019s higher frequencies (especially mmWave) attenuate quickly (walls, foliage, rain). To maintain capacity, operators deploy many more sites (small cells) than with previous generations, but each site transmits at **lower power** than a typical 4G macro\u2011tower.  \n4. **Power control** \u2013 The network constantly adjusts the transmit power to the minimum needed for a reliable link. Phones typically emit only a few milliwatts when close to a tower and increase only when the signal is weak.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat \u201cexposure\u201d actually looks like for a person standing near a 5G antenna  \n\n| Metric | Typical value near a 5G site (public area) | How it compares to everyday sources |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Power density (W/m\u00b2)** | <\u202f0.01\u202fW/m\u00b2 at 5\u202fm from a typical sub\u2011",
