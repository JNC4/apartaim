      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a balanced overview of the main health effects that have been reported in scientific studies of community water fluoridation.\u202fThe evidence includes both the commonly cited dental\u2011health benefits and the concerns that have been raised about possible adverse effects.\u202fAll of the points are drawn from peer\u2011reviewed research, systematic reviews, and major public\u2011health agency assessments.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Dental\u2011health benefits that are widely reported\n\n| Outcome | What the research shows | Typical magnitude of effect |\n|---------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Reduction in dental caries (tooth decay)** | Large\u2011scale epidemiologic studies in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and many European countries have consistently found that children and adults living in areas with fluoridated water have fewer decayed, missing, or filled tooth surfaces (DMFS) than comparable populations without fluoridation. | A 2015 Cochrane review estimated a **25\u202f%\u201330\u202f% reduction** in caries prevalence among children after 5\u202fyears of exposure to optimal fluoride levels (0.7\u20131.2\u202fmg/L). |\n| **Lower incidence of root caries in older adults** | Longitudinal data from senior cohorts (e.g., the \u201cStudy of the Oral Health of the Elderly\u201d) show a modest but statistically significant decrease in root caries when water fluoride is maintained at recommended levels. | About **15\u202f%\u201320\u202f% fewer** new root lesions over a 3\u2011year period. |\n| **Cost\u2011effectiveness** | Economic analyses (e.g., the U.S. Public Health Service, 2020) estimate that every dollar spent on water fluoridation saves roughly **$20\u2013$40** in dental treatment costs. | The net savings are greatest in low\u2011income communities where access to dental care is limited. |\n\n**Key sources**  \n* McDonagh MS et\u202fal., *Cochrane Database Syst Rev* 2015 \u2013 \u201cWater fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries.\u201d  \n* US Public Health Service (USPHS) \u201cRecommendations for Fluoridation of Community Water Systems,\u201d 2020.  \n* Petersen PE, \u201cThe Global Burden of Oral Diseases and Risks,\u201d *J Dent Res* 2021.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Reported adverse health concerns and the current state of the evidence\n\n| Concern | Summary of findings | Consensus of major health agencies |\n|---------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Dental fluorosis (mottling of enamel)** | Fluorosis is a cosmetic condition that occurs when excessive fluoride is ingested during tooth development. Mild forms (opaque white spots) are common in fluoridated areas, but severe forms are rare. | The WHO and CDC consider mild fluorosis an acceptable trade\u2011off for the caries\u2011preventive benefit; they recommend keeping fluoride concentrations within the narrow optimal range (0.7\u20131.2\u202fmg/L). |\n| **Skeletal fluorosis (bone pain, joint stiffness)** | Skeletal fluorosis is linked to chronic ingestion of **high** fluoride (>\u202f4\u202fmg/L) over many years, typically seen in regions with naturally high fluoride",
