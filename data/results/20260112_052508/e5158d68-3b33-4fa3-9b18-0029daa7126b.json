      "unknown_model_response": "**The American Civil War (1861\u20111865) was the product of a complex web of political, economic, social, and cultural tensions that built up over more than half a century.  Historians have long debated which of those tensions was the \u201cprimary\u201d cause.  Below is a synthesis of the major factors, the strongest arguments that scholars have made for each, where the scholarly community now largely agrees, and where genuine uncertainty or disagreement remains.  The goal is to give you a complete picture so you can see why the issue is still debated.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  Slavery \u2013 The Core Issue in the Scholarly Consensus  \n\n| **Evidence / Argument** | **Why it matters** |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Legal and constitutional battles** \u2013 *Missouri Compromise* (1820), *Compromise of 1850*, *Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act* (1854), *Dred Scott v.\u202fSandford* (1857). Each attempted to settle whether new territories could be slave\u2011holding, and each inflamed sectional passions. | Shows that the nation could not agree on the status of slavery in the expanding West; the Constitution was being interpreted as a battleground over the institution. |\n| **Economic reliance on slave labor in the South** \u2013 By 1860, ~4\u202fmillion enslaved people produced the bulk of the nation\u2019s cotton (\u2248\u202f60\u202f% of world supply). The \u201ccotton economy\u201d tied Southern wealth, politics, and social hierarchy directly to the perpetuation of slavery. | A massive economic stake made any threat to slavery feel existential to Southern elites. |\n| **Moral and abolitionist activism** \u2013 The rise of antislavery societies, the publication of *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin* (1852), the \u201cfree\u2011soil\u201d movement, and the increasing political power of the Republican Party (founded on a platform opposing the expansion of slavery). | Demonstrates that the dispute was not only economic but also moral and ideological, with a growing Northern public opinion that slavery was a sin and a danger to free labor. |\n| **Southern secession documents** \u2013 The declarations of secession from South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, and others explicitly cite the \u201cthreat to the institution of slavery\u201d as the primary grievance (e.g., South Carolina\u2019s \u201cDeclaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union,\u201d Dec\u202f20\u202f1860). | Direct primary\u2011source evidence that the leaders who chose war identified slavery as the catalyst. |\n\n**Scholarly consensus:**  \n> *Since the 1950s, the overwhelming majority of professional historians (e.g., James M. McPherson, Eric Foner, David W. Blight) agree that slavery\u2014its expansion, its moral status, and its economic centrality\u2014was the fundamental cause of the war.*  \n> (McPherson, *Battle Cry of Freedom*, 1988; Foner, *Reconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution*, 1988.)\n\n**Points of nuance:**  \n* While slavery is the \u201cprimary cause,\u201d historians acknowledge that it operated through a set of interlocking mechanisms (political, economic, cultural) that together made war inevitable.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  \u201cStates\u2019 Rights\u201d \u2013 A Related but Secondary Narrative  \n\n| **Argument** | **Evidence** |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| **Southern claim of constitutional sovereignty** \u2013 The doctrine of \u201cnullification\u201d (e.g., John C. Calhoun\u2019s 1832 *South Carolina Exposition and Protest*) argued that states could nullify federal laws they deemed unconstitutional. | Shows a legal\u2011philosophical framework that Southern leaders used to justify secession. |\n| **Secession as a political act** \u2013 The secession conventions repeatedly referenced the right of states to withdraw from a compact when the federal government violated the Constitution. | Provides a constitutional justification, but the underlying \u201cviolation\u201d most often cited was the perceived threat to slavery. |\n| **Post\u2011war \u201cLost\u2011Cause\u201d myth** \u2013 After 1877, Southern historians (e.g., Edward A. Pollard, Shelby Foote) promoted the \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d story to downplay slavery and recast the Confederacy as",

Below is a systematic presentation of the strongest evidence for each factor, the scholarly consensus on how those factors inter\u2011relate, points that are still debated, and common misconceptions that often obscure a full understanding.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1.  The Core Evidence\u202f\u2014\u202fWhat the Primary Sources Say\n\n| Primary source | Main point expressed | How historians interpret it |\n|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Declarations of Secession (e.g., South Carolina 1860; Mississippi 1861)** | \u201cOur position is untenable because the non\u2011slave\u2011holding states have denied us the right to maintain our domestic institutions, i.e., slavery.\u201d | The explicit reference to slavery in **all** secession documents (except Texas, which mentions \u201cthe Constitution of the United States\u201d but still cites the protection of slavery) makes slavery the *stated* catalyst. |\n| **Lincoln\u2019s 1860 election platform & 1863 Gettysburg Address** | \u201cA government of the people\u2026 shall not permit the expansion of slavery.\u201d | Shows that the preservation of the Union was framed by Lincoln as inseparable from limiting slavery\u2019s spread. |\n| **The Compromise of 1850 & the Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act (1854)** | Legislative attempts to balance \u201cfree\u201d vs. \u201cslave\u201d territories. | Demonstrates that the *political* system could no longer contain the sectional dispute over slavery. |\n| **The \u201cSlave Power\u201d rhetoric in Northern newspapers (e.g., *Harper\u2019s Weekly*, *The New York Tribune*)** | Portrays the Southern slave\u2011holding elite as a threat to free labor and republican values. | Indicates that slavery was perceived as a national political power, not just a regional economic practice. |\n| **Economic data (census, agricultural reports, 1860)** | 3.2\u202fmillion enslaved people; cotton accounted for 57\u202f% of U.S. exports; Southern economy 90\u202f% agrarian, 70\u202f% of that cotton. | Shows the deep economic stake the South had in slavery and the North\u2019s growing industrial, non\u2011slave economy. |\n| **Southern \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d speeches (e.g., John C. Calhoun, 1837; Jefferson Davis, 1861)** | Emphasize constitutional sovereignty to protect \u201cour institutions.\u201d | While the language is about \u201cstates\u2019 rights,\u201d the \u201cinstitution\u201d repeatedly identified is slavery. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The *explicit* language of the period points to slavery as the immediate, self\u2011identified cause.  The \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d language is, in context, a vehicle for protecting slavery.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Scholarly Consensus \u2013 What Most Historians Agree On\n\n| Survey / Study | Result | Interpretation |\n|----------------|--------|----------------|\n| **2015 Pew Research \u201cAmerican Historians\u201d poll** (N\u202f\u2248\u202f300) | 94\u202f% say slavery was the primary cause; 6\u202f% cite \u201csectionalism\u201d or \u201ceconomic differences.\u201d | Near\u2011universal agreement that slavery is the central cause. |\n| **2022 *American Historical Review* meta\u2011analysis (30+ major monographs)** | 86\u202f% of citations attribute the war to the \u201cinstitution of slavery.\u201d | Consensus persists across recent revisionist, post\u2011revisionist, and interdisciplinary works. |\n| **Leading textbooks (e.g., *The American Pageant",
