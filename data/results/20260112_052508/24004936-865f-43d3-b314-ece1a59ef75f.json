      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets\u2014usually government bonds and, in some programmes, corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities.  \nThe goal is to lower long\u2011term interest rates, ease credit conditions and stimulate demand when the ordinary policy rate is already at (or near) its lower bound.  \n\nBecause QE works through a set of transmission channels (interest\u2011rate, portfolio\u2011rebalancing, exchange\u2011rate and expectations effects), its **distributional consequences** are not uniform.  Different groups experience gains, losses, or ambiguous outcomes depending on how the policy changes the prices of the assets they hold, the cost of borrowing they face, and the macro\u2011economic environment in which they operate.\n\nBelow is a **structured overview** that brings together the most frequently cited evidence, distinguishes what is well\u2011established from what remains debated, and highlights the main channels through which QE reaches various agents.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels of QE  \n\n| Channel | What changes | Typical winners | Typical losers / at\u2011risk groups |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Long\u2011term interest\u2011rate channel** | Central\u2011bank purchases push up bond prices \u2192 yields fall. | Borrowers of long\u2011dated debt (mortgages, corporate bonds, governments). | Holders of existing fixed\u2011rate bonds (especially retirees relying on bond coupons). |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing (asset\u2011price) channel** | Investors shift from the assets the central bank buys (e.g., Treasuries) into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate). | Owners of equities, REITs, high\u2011yield corporate bonds, and other \u201crisky\u201d assets; firms that can raise equity or issue corporate bonds cheaply. | Holders of cash or low\u2011yielding safe assets; low\u2011income households that have little exposure to financial markets. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Lower domestic yields make the domestic currency less attractive \u2192 depreciation. | Export\u2011oriented firms and workers in tradable\u2011goods sectors (price\u2011competitive exports). | Import\u2011dependent consumers and firms (higher import prices). |\n| **Expectations / confidence channel** | Signalling that the central bank will keep rates low for an extended period raises inflation expectations and reduces \u201ctightness\u201d in credit markets. | Firms that anticipate higher future demand and can invest now; households that feel more secure about employment. | Agents who are highly debt\u2011averse or who fear future inflation eroding real wages. |\n| **Liquidity / credit\u2011supply channel** | By buying securities, the central bank injects reserves into the banking system, potentially encouraging banks to lend more. | Small\u2011 and medium\u2011size enterprises (SMEs) that obtain new loans; borrowers with marginal creditworthiness. | Banks that are already well\u2011capitalised may not increase lending (the \u201cliquidity trap\u201d); households with poor credit may still be excluded. |\n\n> **Key point:** The same QE episode can simultaneously raise the price of some assets (helping owners) while lowering the yield on others (hurting fixed\u2011income investors). The net effect on a given group depends on the composition of its balance sheet and its exposure to borrowing costs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How QE affects **major population groups**  \n\n### 2.1. Households  \n\n| Sub\u2011group | Main QE impact | Evidence (U.S., Euro Area, UK, Japan) | Consensus vs. debate |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Borrowers (mortgage owners, car\u2011loan borrowers, credit\u2011card users)** | Lower long\u2011term rates \u2192 cheaper mortgages and other loans. | *Federal Reserve* (2020) estimated a 0.5\u20111\u202f% reduction in 30\u2011yr mortgage rates after the first QE round (QE1, 2008\u20112014).

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Quantitative Easing (QE) Affects People Who **Don\u2019t Own a Home**  \n*Focus: renters, savers (cash\u2011deposit holders), and other non\u2011home\u2011owner households.*\n\n---\n\n### 1. The big picture  \n\n| QE effect | What changes in the economy | How that change reaches renters & savers |\n|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Long\u2011term interest\u2011rate fall** (Treasury & mortgage\u2011backed securities) | Yields on safe assets (Treasury bonds, agency MBS, high\u2011quality corporate bonds) drop. | Banks\u2019 cost of funding falls \u2192 **savings\u2011account rates decline** (often to near\u2011zero). |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** (investors move from safe bonds to riskier assets) | Prices of equities, corporate bonds, REITs, and housing rise. | **Rents tend to rise** because higher home prices increase the \u201cshadow cost\u201d of renting; landlords may invest in property upgrades, passing costs to tenants. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate depreciation** (domestic currency weakens) | Imports become more expensive, pushing up the price level. | Renters feel higher **cost\u2011of\u2011living** pressures (food, utilities, transportation). |\n| **Expectations & confidence** (central\u2011bank signalling of \u201cample liquidity\u201d) | Inflation expectations rise modestly; credit conditions become easier. | May lead to **higher wages** (especially in sectors with tight labor markets) that offset some rent\u2011cost pressure, but the net effect varies by region and skill level. |\n| **Liquidity / credit\u2011supply** (banks receive more reserves) | Banks are more willing to lend to businesses and, sometimes, to consumers. | Some renters obtain **new credit** (e.g., personal loans, credit\u2011cards) at lower rates, but many low\u2011income renters remain credit\u2011constrained. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. What happens to **savings\u2011account interest rates**?\n\n| Step | Mechanism | Typical outcome for a saver |\n|------|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| 1. **QE \u2192 central bank buys Treasuries & agency MBS** | This pushes up bond prices \u2192 yields fall (e.g., the 10\u2011yr Treasury fell from ~2\u202f% to <1\u202f% in the U.S. after the 2020 QE round). | The \u201cbenchmark\u201d that banks use to set deposit rates declines. |\n| 2. **Banks\u2019 cost of funds drops** | With abundant reserves, the overnight interbank rate (Fed Funds, Euribor, etc.) sits near zero. | Banks have less \u201cprice pressure\u201d to pay savers for holding deposits. |\n| 3. **Deposit\u2011rate competition weakens** | In a low\u2011rate environment, banks compete on fees, digital services, or promotional \u201chigh\u2011yield\u201d accounts rather than on baseline rates. | **Average savings\u2011account APY** in the United States fell from about **0.30\u202f% (2020 Q1)** to **0.07\u202f% (2022 Q4)**, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Similar patterns appeared in the Euro\u2011area (ECB data: average \u20ac\u2011denominated deposit rate fell from 0.45\u202f% in 2019 to 0.01\u202f% in 2022). |\n| 4. **Real\u2011interest\u2011rate effect** | If inflation is positive (even modestly), the **real return** on cash can become **negative**. | A saver who keeps $10,000 in a regular savings account may see the purchasing power of that money shrink by 2\u20133\u202f% per year while the nominal balance grows by <0.1\u202f%. |\n\n#### Empirical snapshot (U.S. data)\n\n| Period | 1\u2011yr Treasury yield (proxy for safe\u2011asset return) | Avg. national savings\u2011account APY (FDIC) | Real net return (approx.) |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Jan\u202f2019 | 2.7\u202f% | 0.40\u202f% | \u20132.3\u202f% |\n| Jan\u202f2020 (pre\u2011QE4) | 2.0\u202f% | 0.30\u202f% | \u20131.7\u202f% |\n| Jun\u202f2020 (after QE\u20114 start) | 0.5\u202f% | 0.08\u202f% | \u20130.42\u202f% |\n| Dec\u202f2021 (peak QE) | 1.5\u202f% | 0.12\u202f% | \u20131.38\u202f% |\n| Jun\u202f202",
