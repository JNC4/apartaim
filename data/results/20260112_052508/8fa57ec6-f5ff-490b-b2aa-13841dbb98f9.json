      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to **re\u2011allocate** jobs rather than create or destroy a large number of them overall. The net effect on workers depends on the country\u2019s level of development, the skill mix of its labour force, the strength of its social\u2011safety\u2011net, and the design of the agreement (e.g., whether it includes labour\u2011rights clauses). In most empirical studies the aggregate impact on employment is modest, but the distribution of gains and losses can be sizable and highly sector\u2011specific.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic mechanism\n\n| Step | What happens | Typical result for workers |\n|------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **Tariff removal** | Goods become cheaper for importers; exporters gain market access. | Consumers (including workers) enjoy lower prices; firms in export\u2011oriented sectors can expand. |\n| **Factor\u2011price equalisation** (the \u201cHeckscher\u2011Ohlin\u201d story) | Countries specialise in the production of goods that use their relatively abundant factor (labour, capital, skill). | Workers in *abundant* factor industries (often low\u2011skill labour in developing countries, high\u2011skill labour in advanced economies) tend to see higher demand and wages; the opposite occurs in *scarce*\u2011factor industries. |\n| **Re\u2011allocation of resources** | Capital, technology and labour move toward export sectors; import\u2011competing firms may shrink or exit. | Some workers lose jobs in protected or import\u2011competing sectors; others gain jobs in expanding export sectors. |\n| **Productivity spill\u2011overs** | Exposure to foreign competition can push firms to adopt better technology and management practices. | In the long run, workers in surviving firms can earn higher wages and enjoy better working conditions, but the transition can be painful for displaced workers. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence says\n\n### 2.1 Overall employment and output\n* **Broad consensus (OECD, WTO, ILO):** FTAs raise a country\u2019s **real GDP** by roughly 0.5\u20112\u202f% over a decade, mainly through higher export volumes. The effect on total employment is usually small because the gain in jobs in export sectors is partly offset by losses in import\u2011competing sectors.  \n* **Key studies**  \n  * **Baier & Bergstrand (2007, *American Economic Review*)** \u2013 a meta\u2011analysis of 40\u2011plus FTAs finds a median 0.5\u202f% rise in GDP per year, with no systematic increase in total employment.  \n  * **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016, *American Economic Review*)** \u2013 using the \u201cChina shock\u201d as a natural experiment, they show that trade\u2011induced job losses are concentrated in low\u2011skill manufacturing, while high\u2011skill sectors gain.\n\n### 2.2 Wage effects\n| Context | Typical finding | Caveats |\n|--------|----------------|--------|\n| **Developing countries (low\u2011skill abundant)** | Average wages rise modestly (\u22481\u20113\u202f% over 5\u201110\u202fyears) in export\u2011oriented manufacturing; however, wages in shrinking import\u2011competing sectors can fall. | Gains are larger when the FTA is paired with **labour\u2011market reforms** and **skill\u2011training programs**. |\n| **Advanced economies (high\u2011skill abundant)** | High\u2011skill wages tend to increase (\u22482\u20115\u202f%); low\u2011skill wages may stagnate or fall slightly, especially in regions dependent on displaced manufacturing. | The magnitude varies with **union density**, **minimum\u2011wage laws**, and the presence of **trade adjustment assistance**. |\n| **Overall** | The net effect on the **average** wage is usually small (\u22480\u20132\u202f%). The distributional impact\u2014winners vs. losers\u2014is far more important. | Studies differ on the size of the \u201cskill\u2011bias\u201d; estimates range from modest to sizable, reflecting data, methodology, and country differences. |\n\n### 2.3 Job displacement and transition costs\n* **Short\u2011run adjustment** can be painful: a typical FTA leads to a **2\u20115\u202f% decline** in employment in the most",
