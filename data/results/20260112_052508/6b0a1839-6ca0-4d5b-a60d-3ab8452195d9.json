      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect the wages and job security of workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Overall, most studies find that free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) raise average real wages in the signatory economies over the long run, but the gains are unevenly distributed.**  \n- **Job security tends to improve in sectors that expand under the agreement and to decline in sectors that contract, creating short\u2011run displacement for some workers.**  \n- **The net effect on any individual worker depends on their skill level, industry, geographic location, and the presence of complementary policies (e.g., training programs, unemployment insurance).**\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that spells out why these patterns appear, what the empirical record shows, and where the scholarly debate still exists.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical expectations\n\n| Mechanism | Expected impact on wages | Expected impact on job security | Key assumptions |\n|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Comparative advantage & factor\u2011price equalization** (Heckscher\u2011Ohlin, Stolper\u2011Samuelson) | Trade\u2011exposed *low\u2011skill* workers see **wage pressure downward**; *high\u2011skill* workers see **wage pressure upward** because the economy reallocates resources toward the abundant factor. | Workers in expanding export\u2011oriented sectors gain **more stable employment**, while those in contracting import\u2011competing sectors face **higher turnover or layoffs**. | Perfect competition, no frictions in labor mobility, identical technologies across borders. |\n| **Dynamic gains (productivity, technology diffusion)** | Higher overall productivity can **raise the marginal product of labor** in all sectors, eventually **lifting average wages** for both skilled and unskilled workers. | Greater productivity can **create new jobs** (e.g., in logistics, services) and **reduce the duration of unemployment** if workers can move to growing sectors. | Existence of learning\u2011by\u2011doing, R&D spill\u2011overs, and flexible labor markets. |\n| **Adjustment costs & short\u2011run rigidities** | In the transition period, **real wages may fall** for workers stuck in shrinking industries because they cannot immediately retrain or relocate. | **Job insecurity spikes** in the first 2\u20115\u202fyears after an FTA as firms restructure. | Nominal wage rigidity, limited geographic mobility, insufficient safety\u2011net coverage. |\n| **Labor\u2011content provisions (e.g., \u201csocial clauses\u201d)** | If an agreement enforces **minimum\u2011wage, collective\u2011bargaining, or occupational\u2011safety standards**, it can **protect or even raise wages** in the signatory country relative to a partner with weaker rules. | Such clauses can **reduce the risk of \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d employment practices**, improving job security. | Effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. |\n\n*Take\u2011away*: Theory predicts **heterogeneous** effects\u2014some workers win, some lose\u2014especially in the short run. Long\u2011run outcomes depend on how quickly economies can reallocate resources and on the institutional context.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
