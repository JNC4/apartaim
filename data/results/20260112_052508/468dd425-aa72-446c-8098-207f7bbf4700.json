The optimal level is still a matter of public\u2011policy discussion, not of basic science. |\n| **Primary health benefit** | **Prevention of dental caries (tooth decay).** Fluoride incorporated into developing tooth enamel makes it more resistant to acid attack, and it also inhibits the metabolism of cariogenic bacteria. | \u2022 **Systematic reviews** (e.g., Cochrane 2015; US\u202fCDC 2021) find a **~25\u202f% reduction in caries incidence** in children and adolescents after 5\u201110\u202fyears of exposure to optimally fluoridated water. <br>\u2022 **Ecological studies** across the U.S. (e.g., Burt & Eklund 2020) show that counties with fluoridated water have 15\u201130\u202f% fewer decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) than non\u2011fluoridated counties, after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. | The magnitude of benefit can vary with diet, oral\u2011hygiene practices, and access to other fluoride sources (toothpaste, professional gels). In very low\u2011caries populations the incremental benefit may be modest. |\n| **Safety profile \u2013 dental fluorosis** | Fluorosis is a change in the appearance of tooth enamel caused by excess fluoride intake during the years when teeth are forming (\u2248birth to age\u202f8). | \u2022 At the **0.7\u202fmg/L** target, the prevalence of **mild (questionable) fluorosis** is typically **\u226410\u202f%**, while **moderate\u2013severe fluorosis** is **<1\u202f%** in most studies (e.g., CDC 2022 surveillance). <br>\u2022 Mild fluorosis appears as faint white streaks and is considered a **cosmetic issue only**, not a health problem. | Some argue that even mild fluorosis is undesirable, especially in societies that value aesthetic perfection. The balance between cosmetic risk and caries benefit is a value judgment rather than a scientific one. |\n| **Systemic toxicity (acute or chronic)** | Acute toxicity would require ingestion of **grams** of fluoride (far above the ppm levels in drinking water). Chronic toxicity concerns focus on **skeletal fluorosis** and possible associations with other diseases. | \u2022 **Acute poisoning** from municipal water is essentially impossible; the dose needed to cause symptoms (\u22485\u202fmg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9) would require drinking **>10\u202fL\u202fday\u207b\u00b9 for months** at 0.7\u202fmg/L. <br>\u2022 **Skeletal fluorosis** (painful joint stiffness, bone changes) is documented only in populations with **intake >4\u202fmg/L** over many years (e.g., certain high\u2011natural\u2011fluoride regions of India, China, Africa). <br>\u2022 **Regulatory agencies** (U.S. EPA, WHO, EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks) set a **Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) of 4\u202fmg/L** and a **drinking\u2011water standard of 2\u202fmg/L** to protect against skeletal fluorosis. The 0.7\u202fmg/L level is **far below** these limits. | Some epidemiologic studies have reported **associations** between higher fluoride exposure (often >1\u202fmg/L) and outcomes such as **reduced IQ in children**, **thyroid dysfunction**, or **renal disease**. However: <br>\u2022 Most of these studies are **observational** and subject",
