      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that try to change a target country\u2019s behaviour by using economic pressure instead of (or in addition to) military force.**  \nTheir influence depends on a mix of economic, political, and strategic factors, and the evidence shows a mixed record\u2014sanctions sometimes achieve their aims, sometimes only partially, and sometimes back\u2011fire. Below is a structured overview of how sanctions work, what the research says about their effectiveness, and the main conditions that determine their impact.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Theoretical pathways \u2013 *why* sanctions might work\n\n| Pathway | How it is supposed to affect the target | Typical evidence used |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Coercion (cost\u2011imposition)** | Reduces the target\u2019s national income, foreign exchange, or access to critical inputs, making the status\u2011quo more costly than the demanded policy change. | Declines in GDP, trade volumes, or specific sector output after sanctions are imposed. |\n| **Signalling / Reputation** | Demonstrates the sanctioning coalition\u2019s resolve, raising the political cost of defiance for the target\u2019s leadership (e.g., fear of isolation, loss of legitimacy). | Survey data on elite attitudes; changes in diplomatic behavior after threat of sanctions. |\n| **Incentive (carrot\u2011plus\u2011stick)** | Combines pressure with a promise of relief if the target complies, creating a \u201cprice\u201d for policy change. | Cases where sanctions were lifted quickly after a negotiated concession (e.g., Iran nuclear deal, Libya 2011). |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | Economic hardship can trigger public unrest, elite dissent, or elite defection, pressuring leaders to alter policy. | Protest activity, elite defections, or leadership changes following prolonged sanctions (e.g., South Africa, Zimbabwe). |\n| **Punishment / Moral condemnation** | Seeks to delegitimize the target regime by imposing costs regardless of any policy change, often for human\u2011rights violations. | Symbolic measures (asset freezes, travel bans) that affect elite personal wealth and international standing. |\n\n*Key point:* The pathways are not mutually exclusive; most sanction regimes rely on a combination of them.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2.1  Overall success rates\n| Study | Sample | Definition of \u201csuccess\u201d | Reported success rate |\n|-------|--------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* | 221 cases (1970\u20112005) | Policy change *directly* attributable to sanctions (including partial compliance) | **\u2248 34\u202f%** (full compliance 22\u202f%, partial 12\u202f%) |\n| **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox* | 100+ cases (post\u2011Cold War) | Regime change, policy reversal, or concession | **\u2248 30\u202f%** |\n| **Peksen (2019)** \u2013 meta\u2011analysis of 1,400 sanction episodes | Varies by type (targeted vs. comprehensive) | Measurable policy shift within 5\u202fyears | **\u2248 40\u202f%** for targeted sanctions; **\u2248 20\u202f%** for broad trade embargoes |\n| **Gordon, McMann, & Tingle (2022)** \u2013 *Sanctions and State Behavior* (JPE) | 64 multilateral sanctions (UN, EU, US) | \u201cPolicy concession\u201d (e.g., nuclear talks, cease\u2011fire) | **\u2248 45\u202f%** when sanctions are **multilateral** and **targeted** |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:**  Sanctions work more often than a \u201c",

      "unknown_model_response": "## Secondary Sanctions \u2013\u202fWhat They Are and How They Reach Outside the Sanctioning Country  \n\n### 1.  The basic definition  \n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|----------|\n| **Primary sanctions** | Restrictions that apply **directly** to persons, firms, or entities **national to** (or located in) the sanctioning jurisdiction (e.g., U.S. persons are prohibited from doing business with Iran). |\n| **Secondary sanctions** | **Coercive measures that target non\u2011national (third\u2011party) persons or entities** **because they engage with the primary\u2011sanctioned target**. The sanction\u2011imposing state does **not** need a domestic law that directly bans the activity; instead it threatens to **cut off the third party\u2019s access to the sanctioning state\u2019s market or financial system** if they continue the prohibited dealings. |\n\nIn short, secondary sanctions **extend the reach of a primary sanctions regime** by punishing *anyone*\u2014regardless of nationality\u2014who helps the primary target, unless they stop the prohibited activity.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  How they are implemented in practice  \n\n| Step | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **a. Legal authority** | The sanctioning government issues an **executive order, decree, or law** that explicitly authorises secondary measures. In the United States, the authority comes from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act, and specific statutes (e.g., the Counter\u2011Terrorism Sanctions Act, the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act). The EU uses **Council Regulations** that can impose \u201crestrictive measures against third\u2011country persons\u201d under its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). |\n| **b. Target list** | A **secondary\u2011sanctions list** is published (e.g., OFAC\u2019s \u201cSDN \u2013 Secondary Sanctions\u201d list). It contains **non\u2011U.S. persons** (companies, banks, shipping vessels, individuals) that have \u201csignificant transactions\u201d with the primary target. The list is updated frequently as investigations uncover new connections. |\n| **c. Threat of exclusion** | The sanction\u2011imposing state **declares that any person who continues the prohibited activity will be denied**: <br>\u2022 **U.S. market access** (no U.S. dollar clearing, no entry into U.S. ports, no U.S. securities listings). <br>\u2022 **EU market access** (ban on EU\u2011origin goods, denial of EU financial services). |\n| **d. Enforcement mechanisms** | \u2022 **Financial\u2011institution screening** \u2013 banks run automated checks against the secondary\u2011sanctions list before processing transactions. <br>\u2022 **Customs and export\u2011control inspections** \u2013 shipments flagged by the list can be seized. <br>\u2022 **Legal penalties** \u2013 civil fines (U.S. civil penalties can exceed\u202f$10\u202fmillion per violation) and, in rare cases, criminal prosecution. |\n| **e. \u201cGrace periods\u201d or \u201cwaivers\u201d** | Some regimes provide limited\u2011time waivers for humanitarian goods, certain agricultural products, or for entities that can demonstrate **\u201creasonable steps\u201d** to avoid prohibited dealings. This nuance matters for companies trying to stay compliant while still serving legitimate customers. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Why secondary sanctions matter for non\u2011U.S./non\u2011EU firms  \n\n| Effect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Loss of access to the U.S. financial system** | The U.S. dollar dominates global trade finance. If a bank is placed on the OFAC \u201cSDN\u201d list, **U.S. banks must terminate correspondent relationships**. The affected bank loses the ability to clear dollar payments, which can cripple its international business. |\n| **Denial of U.S. market participation** | Companies listed may be barred from **listing on U.S. exchanges, obtaining U.S. investment, or contracting with U.S. government agencies**. For multinational firms, that loss can be worth billions. |\n| **Secondary impact on EU/UK/Swiss markets** | After the EU adopted its own secondary\u2011sanctions framework (e.g., against Russia in 2022), **EU\u2011based banks also began screening for EU secondary\u2011sanctions lists**. Firms that ignore the EU list risk being cut off from the EU market as well. |\n| **Reputational risk & \u201cde\u2011risking\u201d** | Even if a firm is not formally listed, many **global banks and insurers adopt \u201cover\u2011",
