Radio\u2011frequency (RF) generation** | A base\u2011station contains one or more transceivers that generate electromagnetic waves in the **5\u202fG frequency bands**. 5\u202fG uses three broad ranges:  <br>\u2022 **Low\u2011band** (sub\u20111\u202fGHz, e.g., 600\u202fMHz, 700\u202fMHz) \u2013 long range, similar to 4G. <br>\u2022 **Mid\u2011band** (1\u20136\u202fGHz, most commonly 2.5\u20133.5\u202fGHz) \u2013 a compromise of range and capacity. <br>\u2022 **High\u2011band / millimetre\u2011wave (mmWave)** (24\u201340\u202fGHz, and in some regions up to 52\u202fGHz) \u2013 very short range, very high data rates. | The **energy per photon** is proportional to frequency, but the **power density** (W\u202fm\u207b\u00b2) that people receive depends on the transmitted power, antenna gain, and distance. |\n| **b.  Antenna arrays & beamforming** | Modern 5\u202fG sites use **phased\u2011array antennas** (many small radiating elements) that can steer narrow \u201cbeams\u201d toward a specific user equipment (UE) rather than radiating uniformly in all directions. | Beamforming concentrates power in the direction of the device, so the **average** exposure at any fixed point near the tower is usually **lower** than that of an omnidirectional antenna of the same total output power. |\n| **c.  Cell splitting & small cells** | To deliver the higher frequencies (especially mmWave) the network is densified: many **small cells** (often mounted on street furniture, lampposts, or building walls) are placed **tens of meters** apart. They operate at **much lower output power** (typically 0.1\u201310\u202fW) than a macro\u2011cell tower (which may transmit 10\u2013100\u202fW per carrier). | Because the radiating element is closer to the user, the required transmit power is lower, which reduces the **local power density**. |\n| **d.  Power control & duty cycle** | The base\u2011station continuously monitors the signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio at each UE and **adjusts its output power** in real time, often keeping it well below the maximum allowed. Data are sent in short bursts; the RF is not \u201con\u201d continuously at full power. | The **time\u2011averaged** exposure (what most safety standards address) is therefore a fraction of the peak power that the equipment could theoretically emit. |\n| **e.  Back\u2011haul & network integration** | The tower is linked to the core network via fiber, microwave, or satellite. This part does not affect RF exposure to the public. | \u2014 |\n\n### Typical numbers for a 5\u202fG macro\u2011cell (illustrative)\n\n| Parameter | Approximate value | Comparison |\n|-----------|-------------------|------------|\n| Transmit power per carrier (max) | 10\u201340\u202fW (mid\u2011band) < 5\u202fW (mmWave) | Similar to or lower than many 4G sites (which often run 20\u2013100\u202fW). |\n| Antenna gain (effective radiated power, ERP) | 30\u201350\u202fdBi (highly directional) | Directional gain concentrates energy but reduces exposure away from the main beam. |\n| Power density at 10\u202fm from the antenna (worst\u2011case, free\u2011space) | \u2248 0.1\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2 (mid\u2011band) | International limits for the general public are 10\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2 (ICNIRP) for 2\u2013300\u202fGHz. |\n| SAR (specific absorption rate) for a phone near a body | \u2264 1.6\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 (U.S.) / \u2264 2\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 (EU) |",
      "truthbot_response": "**TL;DR** \u2013 5G networks use radio\u2011frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) that are *non\u2011ionising* (they do not have enough energy to break chemical bonds).  All major health\u2011authorities that have examined the peer\u2011reviewed literature (WHO, IARC, ICNIRP, FCC, Health Canada, the European Commission\u2019s SCENIHR, the US National Cancer Institute, etc.) conclude that, **at the exposure levels that the public experiences from 5\u2011G base stations and user devices, there is no credible evidence of adverse health effects**.  The few laboratory and animal studies that have shown biological changes used exposure intensities far above the limits that apply to the public, and the relevance of those findings to everyday human exposure remains disputed.  A small minority of researchers and advocacy groups argue that the evidence is insufficient and call for a precautionary approach, but this view is not supported by the weight of the scientific literature.\n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through:\n\n---\n\n## 1.
