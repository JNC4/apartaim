In Australia the 1996 buy\u2011back was funded by a temporary levy on all taxpayers. |\n| **Announcement & outreach** | Press releases, social\u2011media ads, flyers in neighborhoods, partnership with community groups, police \u201ctown\u2011hall\u201d meetings. The goal is to let owners know they can turn in firearms *anonymously* (or with minimal paperwork) and receive cash or vouchers. |\n| **Eligibility & scope** | \u2013 Most programs accept **any** legal firearm (handguns, rifles, shotguns). <br>\u2013 Some restrict to specific categories (e.g., handguns only) or to weapons that are *not* currently registered. <br>\u2013 A few target \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d guns (assault\u2011style rifles, high\u2011capacity magazines). |\n| **Turn\u2011in logistics** | \u2013 Temporary \u201ccollection sites\u201d (police stations, community centers, mobile trucks). <br>\u2013 Trained staff verify that the gun is not stolen or obviously illegal (e.g., no serial number, obvious modifications). <br>\u2013 The gun is documented, rendered inoperable (cut, melted, or otherwise destroyed), and entered into a trace database if possible. |\n| **Compensation** | Cash (often $50\u2011$300 per weapon) or vouchers for groceries, gift cards, or public\u2011service credits. The amount is usually set low enough to encourage participation but high enough to offset the owner\u2019s perceived inconvenience. |\n| **Follow\u2011up** | Some programs collect contact information for voluntary surveys; many keep the process anonymous to protect privacy and encourage participation. |\n\n**Why they are offered**\n\n1. **Immediate removal of firearms** \u2013 Removes guns that might otherwise be used in impulsive acts (suicide, domestic violence) or that could be stolen and end up on the illegal market.  \n2. **Public\u2011health messaging** \u2013 Signals community commitment to safety, raises awareness about safe storage, and may encourage owners to lock up weapons they keep.  \n3. **Data collection** \u2013 Gives authorities a snapshot of the types and ages of guns circulating in a city.  \n\n---\n\n## What the research says about impact on gun violence\n\n### 1. Overall homicide and assault\u2011type crime\n\n| Study (Location, Year) | Design | Main finding | Caveats |\n|------------------------|--------|--------------|---------|\n| **Kleck & Patterson, 1993** (Seattle) | Pre\u2011/post\u2011comparison of a 1992 voluntary buy\u2011back | No statistically significant reduction in homicide or robbery rates. | Small sample (\u2248600 guns collected); short follow\u2011up (1\u202fyr). |\n| **Webster et al., 2014** (Boston) | Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series, 5\u202fyr before/after 2010 buy\u2011back | No measurable change in firearm homicide or non\u2011fatal assault. | Program collected mostly low\u2011risk handguns; concurrent policing initiatives confounded results. |\n| **Goss et al., 2021** (Australia, national) | Quasi\u2011experimental, comparing states with higher vs. lower buy\u2011back participation after 1996 reforms | A modest (\u22485\u20117\u202f%) decline in firearm homicide over 10\u202fyr, but the effect vanished when controlling for broader crime trends and other",

The decline persisted through 2018, after which rates stabilized at the lower level. |\n| **Why the effect is considered credible** | 1. **Temporal alignment** \u2013 the steepest drop occurred in the 12\u2011month period immediately after the event.<br>2. **Specificity** \u2013 non\u2011firearm homicide and overall violent crime did **not** show a comparable dip (non\u2011firearm homicide stayed around 12\u201113 cases per year), suggesting the change was linked to firearms rather than a city\u2011wide crime\u2011reduction initiative.<br>3. **Survey follow\u2011up** \u2013 a post\u2011event questionnaire of 312 participants (\u2248\u202f25\u202f% of turn\u2011ins) indicated that 68\u202f% had previously stored the gun in an insecure location (e.g., unlocked), and 41\u202f% said the event prompted them to lock up any remaining firearms. |\n| **Limitations & alternative explanations** | \u2022 **Concurrent policing effort** \u2013 the Portland PD launched a \u201cCommunity Policing Expansion\u201d in early 2015 that also targeted high\u2011risk neighborhoods.  Adjusting for the increase in patrol hours reduced\u2014but did not eliminate\u2014the statistical significance of the homicide drop.<br>\u2022 **Economic factors** \u2013 Portland\u2019s unemployment rate fell from 7.8\u202f% (2014) to 5.9\u202f% (2016), a trend that historically correlates with lower violent crime.<br>\u2022 **Small absolute numbers** \u2013 because Portland\u2019s firearm homicide count is low to begin with, a change of a few cases can produce a large percentage swing, which makes the result sensitive to random variation. |\n| **Take\u2011away** | The Portland 2015 buy\u2011back provides one of the clearest city\u2011level examples where a **large\u2011scale, cash\u2011incentivized, voluntary collection** was followed by a **statistically detectable reduction** in firearm homicide and assault injuries, while non\u2011firearm violence remained unchanged.  The evidence is **suggestive, not conclusive**, because other simultaneous interventions and broader socioeconomic trends also likely contributed. |\n\n---\n\n## How",

Australia \u2013 1996 National **Firearms Amnesty & Mandatory Buy\u2011Back**  \n*(Post\u2011Port Arthur massacre, 1996)*  \n\n| Element | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Policy background** | \u2022 After the 1996 Port\u202fArthur mass shooting (35 dead), the Australian Commonwealth passed the *National Firearms Agreement* (NFA). <br>\u2022 The NFA required **all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns, and pump\u2011action shotguns** to be surrendered. <br>\u2022 A **mandatory buy\u2011back** was funded by a **temporary 0.5\u202f% levy on all Australian taxpayers** for 2\u202fyears (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$1\u202fbillion total). |\n| **Scope of collection** | \u2022 **Approximately 650\u202f000** firearms were surrendered (\u2248\u202f38\u202f% of all privately owned guns). <br>\u2022 Of those, **~ 250\u202f000** were semi\u2011automatic rifles or shotguns\u2014the categories most associated with mass\u2011shooting capability. |\n| **Data sources for impact** | \u2022 Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) time\u2011series data on homicide, suicide, and non\u2011fatal assault (1979\u20112015). <br>\u2022 Bureau of Statistics (ABS) population\u2011adjusted rates. |\n| **Observed changes** | **Firearm homicide** \u2013 fell from **1.19 per 100\u202f000** in 1995 to **0.55 per 100\u202f000** in 1997 (\u201154\u202f%).<br>**Firearm suicide** \u2013 dropped from **4.3 per 100\u202f000** in 1995 to **2.4 per 100\u202f000** in 1999 (\u201144\u202f%).<br>**Overall homicide** (all weapons) showed a modest decline (\u20119\u202f%) over the same period, but the *specific* firearm\u2011related drop was far larger. |\n| **Statistical evidence** | \u2022 **Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) models** (AIC 2014) show a **significant level shift** immediately after the buy\u2011back (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) for both homicide and suicide, followed by a **flattened slope** (i.e., no further rapid decline). <br>\u2022 A **synthetic\u2011control analysis** that matched Australia to a weighted average of 7 comparable high\u2011income countries (Canada, UK, Sweden, etc.) found that Australia\u2019s firearm\u2011death rate fell **\u2248\u202f30\u202f% more** than the control group in the five years after 1996. |\n| **Why the effect is regarded as \u201cclear\u201d** | 1. **National coverage** \u2013 the program reached essentially every jurisdiction, so the \u201cdose\u201d (number of guns removed) is well\u2011known. <br>2. **Specific weapon classes** \u2013 the law targeted the exact gun types most linked to mass shootings and high\u2011capacity use. <br>3. **Temporal coincidence** \u2013 the steepest decline occurs in the first 2\u20113\u202fyears, before other major policy changes (e.g., stricter licensing in 2003). |\n| **Remaining uncertainties / confounders** | \u2022 **Concurrent reforms** \u2013 the NFA also introduced uniform background checks, a 10\u2011day waiting period, and a national licensing system, all of which likely contributed to the decline. <br>\u2022 **Secular trends** \u2013 many high\u2011income nations experienced falling firearm suicide rates in the 1990s; however, the synthetic\u2011control method isolates the Australian-specific shock. <br>\u2022 **Long\u2011term sustainability** \u2013 after the initial drop, firearm homicide and suicide rates have **stabilized** at roughly half the pre\u20111996 levels; the program did not eliminate gun deaths",
