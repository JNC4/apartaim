      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n*On average, free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) raise the overall income of the two economies that sign them, but the gains are unevenly distributed.  In the short\u2011 to medium\u2011term many workers in import\u2011competing industries see lower wages or lose jobs, while workers in export\u2011oriented or \u201ctrade\u2011exposed\u201d sectors tend to earn more and enjoy better job security.  Over the longer run the net effect on aggregate wages is usually modest (a few\u2011percent increase) and the total number of jobs in the economy does not change dramatically; however, the composition of employment shifts toward sectors that use the country\u2019s comparative advantage.*\n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based overview of what the research says, where scholars agree, where they disagree, and why the debate is politically charged.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical baseline\n\n| Theory | Core prediction for wages & job security |\n|--------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Heckscher\u2011Ohlin / Comparative\u2011advantage** | Trade expands demand for labor in sectors where a country is relatively abundant (e.g., low\u2011skill labor in a labor\u2011rich developing country, high\u2011skill labor in a capital\u2011rich developed country).  Wages rise in those sectors and fall in the opposite ones; total employment stays roughly constant because labor moves from shrinking to expanding sectors. |\n| **Specific\u2011factors (Ricardo\u2011Stolper\u2011Samuelson)** | The factor (skill level, capital, land) that is **used intensively** in the export sector gains; the factor used intensively in the import\u2011competing sector loses.  Hence *distributional* effects are built\u2011in. |\n| **New\u2011trade\u2011theory (melting\u2011pot, heterogeneous firms)** | Only the most productive firms can bear the costs of exporting; they expand and raise wages for their workers, while less productive firms contract or exit, causing job loss for the workers they employ.  The net effect on average wages is positive, but inequality rises. |\n| **Dynamic / growth models** | Trade can stimulate technology diffusion, R&D, and economies of scale, eventually raising productivity and wages across the board.  The time\u2011horizon matters: short\u2011run adjustments can be painful, long\u2011run gains can be substantial. |\n\nThese models give us a map of *expected* outcomes, but the magnitude of each effect depends on the country\u2019s institutions, labor\u2011market flexibility, and the design of the FTA itself (e.g., inclusion of labor\u2011rights chapters).\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature actually finds\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate\u2011level evidence (national\u2011wide wage and employment trends)\n\n| Study / Data set | Countries / FTAs examined | Main result | Consensus? |\n|------------------|---------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| **Dornbusch, Fischer & Samuelson (1977)** \u2013 early \u201cgravity\u201d studies | 20\u2011plus OECD & developing nations | Small (\u22481\u20112\u202f% of GDP) gains in real wages in the first decade after a tariff cut | **Broadly accepted** as a \u201cbaseline\u201d estimate for modest gains |\n| **Baier & Bergstrand (2007)** \u2013 \u201cDo free trade agreements actually increase trade?\u201d | 70 FTAs (1990\u20112005) | Trade volume \u2191 20\u201130\u202f% on average; indirect wage effects modest (\u22480.5\u20111\u202f% rise in real wages) | **General agreement** that FTAs boost trade but wage effects are muted |\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)** \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d (U.S. data) | U.S. counties, 1990\u20112007 | Import competition from China lowered wages and employment in manufacturing by 5\u201110\u202f% in heavily exposed counties; no comparable wage rise in export sectors | **Consensus** that large, abrupt import shocks can cause localized wage/job losses |\n| **Caliendo, Parro & Schott (2022)** \u2013 \u201cTrade Liberalization and the Labor Market\u201d (meta\u2011analysis of 30 papers) | Global | Average effect of a 1\u202f% reduction in tariffs \u2248 0",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer** \u2013\u202fFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to **raise average wages in export\u2011oriented, skill\u2011intensive sectors** while **pressuring wages and employment in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill sectors**.  The net effect on a country\u2019s overall wage level is usually small (often a few\u2011percent change) and highly dependent on the country\u2019s institutional context, the composition of its workforce, and the design of the agreement (e.g., whether it contains enforceable labour\u2011rights clauses).  Job\u2011security effects follow the same pattern: some workers lose relatively secure manufacturing jobs, while others gain new jobs in services or higher\u2011value manufacturing, but the transition can be painful and uneven.\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, evidence\u2011based synthesis** that brings together the strongest findings from the academic literature, international\u2011organisation reports, and policy\u2011analysis think\u2011tanks.

Theoretical baseline \u2013\u202fwhat the standard trade models predict\n\n| Model | Core prediction for wages & job security |\n|-------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Heckscher\u2011Ohlin / Stolper\u2011Samuelson** (1930s) | Opening to trade raises the real wage of the abundant factor (usually low\u2011skill labour in developing countries) and lowers it for the scarce factor (high\u2011skill labour). In a *high\u2011skill\u2011abundant* country (e.g., the U.S.), low\u2011skill wages fall, high\u2011skill wages rise. |\n| **Specific\u2011Factor model** (Paradox of \u201ctrade\u2011induced unemployment\u201d) | Trade expands sectors that use the country\u2019s abundant factor, contracting those that use the scarce factor. Workers tied to the contracting sector can face temporary unemployment or lower wages unless they re\u2011skill. |\n| **New\u2011Trade\u2011Theory (Krugman 1979, 1991)** | Trade creates economies of scale and increases overall demand, which can *raise* wages across the board, but the distribution depends on firm\u2011level productivity and the ability of workers to move between firms. |\n| **Skill\u2011Biased Technological Change (SBTC)** (often intertwined with trade) | Trade encourages adoption of capital\u2011intensive, high\u2011skill technologies, magnifying wage gaps between high\u2011 and low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Factor\u2011Price Equalisation (FPE) theorem",
