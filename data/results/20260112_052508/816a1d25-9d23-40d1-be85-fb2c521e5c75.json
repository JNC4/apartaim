      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements usually impact workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to produce a mixed set of outcomes for workers in the signatory countries.  In the aggregate they often raise **real incomes** by lowering the price of imported goods and by expanding export markets, but the gains are **unevenly distributed** across sectors, occupations, regions, and skill groups.  Workers in industries that lose market share to foreign competition can experience **job displacement, lower wages, or slower wage growth**, while workers in expanding export\u2011oriented sectors may see **higher demand, higher wages, and more on\u2011the\u2011job training**.  The net effect on overall employment is usually modest, but the **distributional consequences** can be large enough to generate political backlash if complementary policies (e.g., active labour\u2011market programmes, wage\u2011support measures, or labour\u2011rights clauses) are absent.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that separates **well\u2011established findings** from **areas of ongoing debate** and highlights the role of **institutional context**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What FTAs do \u2013 the basic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it changes | Typical impact on workers |\n|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| **Tariff removal** | Lowers the price of imported goods; raises price competitiveness of export\u2011oriented firms. | Consumers (including workers) benefit from cheaper goods; export\u2011sector workers may see higher demand. |\n| **Rules of origin & market access** | Gives firms easier entry into partner markets, often with reduced non\u2011tariff barriers (e.g., standards, licensing). | Expands production in export\u2011oriented industries \u2192 potential job creation and wage growth for those workers. |\n| **Investment\u2011protection provisions** | Encourages foreign direct investment (FDI) by limiting expropriation risk. | Can create new jobs, especially in high\u2011skill manufacturing and services; may also shift jobs from domestic firms to foreign affiliates. |\n| **Labour\u2011related chapters** (in newer FTAs) | Set minimum standards on wages, collective bargaining, occupational health\u2011safety, and right\u2011to\u2011organise. | Intended to protect workers and level the playing field; effectiveness depends on enforcement. |\n| **Dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms** | Provide a legal route for firms (and sometimes unions) to challenge perceived violations. | Can be used to defend labour standards, but also to challenge domestic regulations that are viewed as \u201ctrade barriers.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence \u2013 what the data show\n\n### 2.1 Aggregate welfare and wages\n\n| Study / Source | Sample / Region | Main finding |\n|----------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **World Bank (2020) \u2013 \u201cTrade and Development\u201d** | 150+ low\u2011 and middle\u2011income countries (1990\u20112018) | FTAs raise per\u2011capita GDP by 0.5\u20111\u202f% on average, largely through lower consumer prices. |\n| **OEOE (2021) \u2013 \u201cThe Impact of Trade Liberalisation on Incomes\u201d** | OECD members, 1990\u20112018 | Real wages rose modestly (0.2\u20110.4\u202f% per year) after major FTAs (EU\u2011Canada, EU\u2011Japan). |\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016) \u2013 \u201cThe China Shock\u201d** (used as a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d for large trade shocks) | U.S. manufacturing regions | Trade\u2011induced competition lowered wages and employment in \u201cexposed\u201d manufacturing counties by up to 5\u20117\u202f% over a decade. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  The *average* effect on wages is small and positive, but the *distribution* is highly skewed.  Workers directly competing with imports can lose, while those in expanding sectors gain",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **single, well\u2011documented case study** that illustrates how an FTA can produce sizable, sector\u2011specific labour effects while the overall economy continues to grow.  \nThe example is **the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, 1994\u20112020)** and its impact on **the U.S. automobile\u2011manufacturing sector** (including parts suppliers) and on **the U.S. textile and apparel sector**.

Between 1994\u20112005, U.S. auto\u2011assembly capacity grew by ~5\u202f%, creating ~80\u202fk new jobs, largely in the \u201chigh\u2011skill\u201d segment (engineers, line supervisors). |\n| **Export\u2011oriented plant relocation** | Several U.S. manufacturers (e.g., General Motors, Ford) opened new \u201cborder\u2011state\u201d plants in Mexico to take advantage of lower wages while still qualifying for duty\u2011free access to the U.S. market. | **Job displacement** in the United States: plant closures and layoffs in the \u201clow\u2011skill\u201d assembly segment, especially in the \u201cRust Belt\u201d (e.g., Pontiac, Michigan; Oshawa, Ontario).  The BLS reported an average annual decline of **\u22482\u202f%** in assembly\u2011line employment in the most exposed states (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana). |\n| **Supply\u2011chain integration** | Parts suppliers in the U.S. that could meet the \u201cregional content\u201d rule kept or expanded contracts with auto OEMs, while those that could not lost business. | **Winners:** large, technologically advanced U.S. parts firms (e.g., Bosch, Delphi) that moved R&D and high\u2011value manufacturing to the U.S.; **Losers:** smaller,",
