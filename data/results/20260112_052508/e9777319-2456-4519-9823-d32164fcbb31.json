      "unknown_model_response": "## 1.  How to minimise the risk if you decide to drink raw milk  \n\n| Step | Why it matters | Practical actions you can take |\n|------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| **1. Choose a reputable source** | The biggest single determinant of safety is how the milk is produced, handled, and tested on the farm. | \u2022\u202fBuy only from farms that are **certified by a recognized animal\u2011health program** (e.g., USDA\u202fOrganic, Certified Dairy Farm, or a state\u2011run \u201craw\u2011milk inspection\u201d scheme). <br>\u2022\u202fAsk the farmer for **recent herd health records**: vaccination status, mastitis screening, brucellosis testing, and any recent antibiotic treatments. <br>\u2022\u202fPrefer farms that **test each bulk tank** for the main pathogens ( *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*, *Campylobacter*) and make those results available to customers. |\n| **2. Keep the milk cold from the moment it leaves the udder** | Bacteria double roughly every **20\u202fmin** at 10\u202f\u00b0C; at 4\u202f\u00b0C the growth rate is <\u202f10\u202f% of that. | \u2022\u202fTransport milk in an insulated cooler with ice packs; **target \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C** (39\u202f\u00b0F) within 2\u202fh of milking. <br>\u2022\u202fStore it in a **dedicated, clean refrigerator** that stays at \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C. Do not keep it on the door shelf where temperature fluctuates. |\n| **3. Use small batches and consume quickly** | Even under refrigeration, psychrotrophic spoilage organisms can reach unacceptable levels after 5\u20137\u202fdays. | \u2022\u202fBuy only the amount you can finish within **3\u20135\u202fdays**. <br>\u2022\u202fIf you have more than that, **freeze** the milk in clean, airtight containers (freeze\u2011thaw cycles do not significantly affect safety, though texture changes). |\n| **4. Practice strict hygiene at home** | Cross\u2011contamination after milking can re\u2011introduce pathogens that were absent in the raw product. | \u2022\u202fWash hands, utensils, and containers with hot, soapy water (\u2265\u202f60\u202f\u00b0C) before contact. <br>\u2022\u202fRinse containers with a **food\u2011grade sanitizer** (e.g., a dilute bleach solution 1\u202ftsp per litre, then rinse with clean water) if you are especially concerned. |\n| **5. Consider a \u201chome pasteurisation\u201d step** | A brief heat treatment (often called \u201clow\u2011temperature pasteurisation\u201d) removes the majority of pathogens while preserving many of the raw\u2011milk qualities that people value. | \u2022\u202fHeat the milk to **63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) and hold for 30\u202fmin** (the traditional low\u2011temp/long\u2011time method) **or**  **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs** (HTST) and then cool rapidly. <br>\u2022\u202fUse a calibrated thermometer; stir constantly to avoid hot spots. <br>\u2022\u202fThis step is **legal in most jurisdictions** because the product is no longer \u201craw\u201d after heating, and it dramatically reduces risk (\u2265\u202f5\u2011log reduction of the key pathogens). |\n| **6. Test the milk yourself (optional but helpful)** | Consumer\u2011grade test kits can give an early warning of contamination. | \u2022\u202fPurchase a **coliform/E.\u202fcoli test strip** or a **PCR\u2011based home kit** (available from some agricultural supply stores). <br>\u2022\u202fRun a test on the first batch and repeat periodically; a positive result should prompt you to stop consumption and inform the farmer. |\n| **7. Know the warning signs** | Some spoilage organisms produce off\u2011flavors, curdling, or gas. | \u2022\u202fSmell the milk: sour or \u201crancid\u201d odors indicate spoilage. <br>\u2022\u202fLook for clumping, curd formation, or bubbles. <br>\u2022\u202fIf anything looks or smells abnormal, discard it\u2014do not rely on \u201cit\u2019s only a little off\u201d. |\n| **8. Avoid high\u2011risk situations** | Certain people are far more vulnerable to food\u2011borne illness. | \u2022\u202fDo **not** give raw milk",

Farms that follow strict bio\u2011security have *far* lower pathogen prevalence (e.g., a 2019 German study found *Campylobacter* in only 0.4\u202f% of samples from farms with a certified milking protocol vs. 7\u202f% on non\u2011certified farms). | \u2022 Verify that the farm participates in a **regular microbiological testing program** (e.g., quarterly bulk\u2011tank testing for *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*).<br>\u2022 If the farm refuses to share test results, consider it a red flag. |\n| **B. Verify the milk\u2019s microbial load before you drink it** | \u2013 Request a **most\u2011probable\u2011number (MPN) or colony\u2011forming\u2011unit (CFU) count** for total aerobic bacteria and for specific pathogens. <br>\u2013 If the farm does not test, you can **bring a sample to a certified lab** (often a university extension or private food\u2011testing service) for a one\u2011time check. | Studies from the U.S., Canada, and New Zealand show that **raw milk with total aerobic counts \u2264\u202f100,000\u202fCFU/mL** and **negative for key pathogens** is statistically less likely to cause illness (though not risk\u2011free). Conversely, counts >\u202f500,000\u202fCFU/mL are associated with a **3\u20135\u2011fold increase** in outbreak probability (Bottone et\u202fal., *Foodborne Pathog Dis* 2020). | \u2022 Keep a log of test dates and results; repeat at least **quarterly**.<br>\u2022 Some states (e.g., California, New York) require the farm to post a **\u201craw\u2011milk safety certificate\u201d**; use it as a baseline. |\n| **C. Keep the milk **cold** from milking to consumption** | Store at **\u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F)** at all times. Use a dedicated, cleaned refrigerator compartment; avoid door shelves where temperature fluctuates. | Pathogen growth rates double roughly every **10\u202f\u00b0C** increase (Arrhenius relationship). A 2021 Canadian study showed that *Campylobacter* in raw milk stored at **8\u202f\u00b0C** reached infectious doses (>\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU/mL) within **12\u202fh**, while at **4\u202f\u00b0C** it stayed below that level for **\u2265\u202f48\u202fh**. | \u2022 Use a **thermometer** to verify fridge temperature.<br>\u2022 Transfer milk to a **sterile glass container** (not plastic, which can leach nutrients and harbor bio\u2011film). |\n| **D.

Why home testing is (and isn\u2019t) a substitute for professional lab work  \n\n| Aspect | What a home kit can do | What it **cannot** do |\n|--------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Pathogen detection** | Most kits screen for **indicator bacteria** (e.g., total coliforms, *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Salmonella* spp.) using colour\u2011change chemistry or lateral\u2011flow immuno\u2011assays. | They **cannot guarantee** the absence of every disease\u2011causing organism (e.g., *Campylobacter*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus*). Sensitivity is usually lower than a certified laboratory culture (often 10\u2074\u201310\u2075\u202fCFU/mL detection limit). |\n| **Quantitative vs. qualitative** | Some kits give a **semi\u2011quantitative** result (e.g., \u201c<\u202f10\u202fCFU/mL\u201d, \u201c10\u2011100\u202fCFU/mL\u201d, \u201c>\u202f100\u202fCFU/mL\u201d). Others are simply **yes/no** (presence/absence). | They do **not provide a precise CFU count**, nor do they differentiate between live vs. dead cells when the detection principle is based on DNA or enzyme activity. |\n| **Speed** | Results in **15\u202fmin\u20132\u202fh** (depending on the assay). | Faster turnaround trades off with **lower analytical sensitivity** and a higher false\u2011negative rate, especially when pathogens are present at low levels. |\n| **Regulatory status** | Many kits are sold as **\u201cresearch use only (RUO)\u201d** or **\u201cconsumer food safety\u201d** products; they are not FDA\u2011cleared for diagnostic use. | Because they are not FDA\u2011approved, the **manufacturer\u2019s performance claims are not verified** by a government agency.
