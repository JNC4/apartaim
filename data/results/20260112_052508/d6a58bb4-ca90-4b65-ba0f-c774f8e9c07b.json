The idea is that either the leadership will concede to avoid further damage or domestic constituencies will force a policy reversal. | Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions on individuals/companies vs. broad sectoral bans. |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Signal resolve and isolate** \u2013 sanctions serve a diplomatic purpose, showing that the sender (often a coalition) is serious and willing to bear costs itself. This can deter other potential violators and make the target feel diplomatically isolated. | Multilateral UN resolutions, coordinated EU/US measures, \u201csecondary\u201d sanctions that punish non\u2011sanctioning third parties for dealing with the target. |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Create bargaining space** \u2013 by raising the stakes, sanctions aim to bring the target to the negotiating table under terms more favorable to the sender. | \u201cLift\u2011if\u2011compliance\u201d clauses, phased relief. |\n\n**Why the mechanisms sometimes work**\n\n* **Economic leverage:** Most sanction\u2011imposing states (U.S., EU, UK, Japan) control a large share of global finance, trade, and technology. Cutting off access can quickly shrink a target\u2019s export revenues (e.g., Iran\u2019s oil sales fell \u2248\u202f60\u202f% after 2012 U.S./EU sanctions).  \n* **Elite vulnerability:** Sanctions that freeze assets or bar travel hit the political and business elite directly, making personal loss a strong incentive to change policy.  \n* **International coordination:** When many countries act together, the target finds it harder to substitute alternative partners, increasing the marginal cost of defiance.\n\n---\n\n## Do sanctions \u201ctend\u201d to be successful?  \n\nThe scholarly literature does not give a single \u201cyes/no\u201d answer; success is **highly conditional**.

Most other major economies (EU, Canada, China, Russia, Brazil) continued limited trade (food, medicine, tourism) and supplied critical inputs (fuel, machinery, telecommunications). The \u201csecondary\u201d component (Helms\u2011Burton) was **weakly enforced**; few non\u2011U.S. firms risked U.S. lawsuits because the economic payoff of dealing with Cuba was relatively modest. <br>2. **Target\u2019s economic resilience & substitution** \u2013 Cuba re\u2011oriented its economy toward **non\u2011U.S. partners** (e.g., Venezuela\u2019s oil subsidies 2000\u20112014, Chinese construction contracts, European tourism). The \u201cSpecial Period\u201d of the early\u20111990s was harsh, but the regime survived by **rationing, price controls, and a massive informal sector**. <br>3. **Sanctions hit the civilian population more than the elite** \u2013 Most of the embargo\u2019s pain fell on ordinary Cubans (shortages of medicine, food, consumer goods).
