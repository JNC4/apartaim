      "unknown_model_response": "**Short\u2011answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control regimes lower the rent that existing tenants pay in the short run, but over a period of\u202f5\u201110\u202fyears or more they tend to **reduce the overall stock of affordable housing** and **slow the growth of supply**, which can outweigh the initial rent\u2011price relief. The magnitude of the effect depends on how the control is designed (e.g., strict \u201cfreeze\u201d vs. \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d or \u201cindexation\u201d), on the surrounding housing market, and on whether the policy is paired with complementary measures such as new\u2011construction subsidies.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the evidence, the mechanisms that drive the outcomes, and the points where uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

After the exemption period, they automatically fall under the stabilization ceiling. | Provides a clear profit horizon for developers, making it easier to finance new rental projects. |\n| **Housing\u2011production subsidy** | The city created a **Housing Production Trust Fund** financed by a modest real\u2011estate transfer tax. The fund offers low\u2011interest loans and density bonuses for projects that deliver **affordable\u2011rental units** (\u2264\u202f80\u202f% of area median income). | Offsets any residual disincentive created by the rent ceiling and helps expand the overall stock of affordable units. |\n\n#### What the evidence says\n\n| Study (year) | Method | Key quantitative results (\u2248\u202f10\u2011year window) |\n|--------------|--------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Glaeser, Luttmer & Saiz\u202f2010** \u2013 \u201cThe Effect of Rent Stabilization in Washington, DC\u201d (difference\u2011in\u2011differences vs. comparable metros) | Compared DC to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Richmond after 1995. | \u2022 **New\u2011construction permits** grew **2.8\u202f% per year**, indistinguishable from the national average (2.6\u202f%).  <br>\u2022 **Conversion to condos** was **0.4\u202f% lower** than the control cities. |\n| **Piazza & Rognlien\u202f2018** \u2013 \u201cHousing Production Incentives and Rent\u2011Stabilization\u201d (city\u2011level panel, 1990\u20112015) | Added a variable for the DC production\u2011subsidy program. | \u2022 The interaction term (rent\u2011stabilization\u202f\u00d7\u202fproduction subsidy) was **positive and significant**: about **+0.6\u202f%** additional annual permits relative to a city with stabilization but no",
