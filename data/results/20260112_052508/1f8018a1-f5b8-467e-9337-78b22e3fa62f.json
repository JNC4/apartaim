Below is a synthesis of the strongest evidence and arguments from the academic literature, policy\u2011maker testimonies, and public\u2011debate perspectives.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Core Findings that Have Reached Broad Consensus  \n\n| Finding | Evidence | What it means for different groups |\n|---------|----------|-----------------------------------|\n| **QE raises the prices of tradable financial assets (stocks, corporate bonds, REITs).** | Multiple event\u2011study papers (e.g.,\u202fBorio & Zabai 2016; Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack 2011; D\u2019Amico, English & Van den Heuvel 2019) find that each $100\u202fbn of QE in the U.S. or Euro\u2011area lifted the S&P\u202f500 or STOXX Europe 600 by ~1\u20112\u202f%. | Households that own equities, mutual funds, or retirement accounts with equity exposure (typically higher\u2011income, older, and more financially literate) see a *wealth boost*. Low\u2011income households, who hold little or no equities, receive little direct benefit. |\n| **QE lowers long\u2011term government\u2011bond yields and mortgage rates.** | Central\u2011bank balance\u2011sheet data and Treasury yield curves show a clear downward shift after QE announcements (e.g.,\u202fJoyce, Lasaosa, Stevens & Tong 2011 for the Bank of England; Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens & Tong 2012 for the ECB). | Lower mortgage rates reduce monthly payments for home\u2011buyers and refinancers. The *greatest* benefit accrues to **new home\u2011buyers** and households **with good credit** who can qualify for mortgages. Many low\u2011income renters or borrowers with sub\u2011prime credit do **not** capture this advantage. |\n| **QE modestly improves employment and reduces the unemployment gap.** | Studies that combine macro\u2011models with micro\u2011data (e.g.,\u202fCoibion, Gorodnichenko & Wieland 2020; Glover, Heathcote, Krueger & Rios\u2011Rull 2021) find that each 100\u2011bp cut in long\u2011run rates (the \u201ceffective\u201d result of QE) lowers the unemployment rate by roughly 0",

QE announcement** (e.g., the Fed adds $80\u202fbn of Treasury & MBS purchases) | The Fed creates reserves and buys long\u2011dated government bonds and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS). | Prices of those securities rise \u2192 yields fall. The 10\u2011yr Treasury yield drops from 3.0\u202f% to 2.4\u202f% (\u2248\u202f\u20110.6\u202fpp). The 30\u2011yr mortgage rate, which tracks the 10\u2011yr Treasury plus a spread, falls from 4.5\u202f% to about **4.0\u202f%**. | **Monthly mortgage payment** falls from $1\u202f267 to **$1\u202f184** \u2013 a saving of **$83 per month**, or **$996 per year**. |\n| **b. Ability to refinance** | Lower rates make refinancing attractive. | Most banks lower their \u201cbreak\u2011even\u201d rate for a 30\u2011yr refinance to ~3.8\u202f%. | The family can refinance the $250\u202fk balance at 3.8\u202f% (new payment \u2248 $1\u202f166). The net cash\u2011flow gain is **$101 per month** (\u2248 $1\u202f212\u202fyr). The one\u2011time refinancing cost (appraisal, closing fees) is ~0.5\u202f% of loan \u2248 $1\u202f250, so the break\u2011even horizon is **\u2248\u202f1 year**. |\n| **c. Housing\u2011price channel** (optional) | QE also pushes up house prices by making other assets less attractive. | National median home price rises 3\u20115\u202f% over the next 12\u201118\u202fmonths. | If the family\u2019s home value climbs from $350\u202fk to $365\u202fk, equity grows by $15\u202fk (\u2248\u202f15\u202f%). That extra equity can be used later for a home\u2011equity loan, college tuition, or simply improves net\u2011worth. |\n\n**Take\u2011away for the middle\u2011class family:**  \n- **Direct cash\u2011flow benefit** (lower monthly payment) can be used for discretionary spending, extra savings, or paying down other debt.  \n- **Potential to refinance** adds a one\u2011time cash\u2011inflow after the cost is recouped.  \n- **Housing\u2011price appreciation** raises net worth but also raises future purchase\u2011price barriers for the children\u2019s first home.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Mortgage\u2011rate channel** | Purchases of Treasury and agency MBS push down long\u2011term yields \u2192 lower mortgage rates. | Renters can\u2019t refinance a mortgage they don\u2019t have; a lower rate does not change their rent contract. | **Positive:** Lower mortgage rates can reduce overall housing\u2011price pressure if they spur more supply (e.g., developers can finance new construction cheaper). <br>**Negative:** Cheaper mortgages can *inflate* home prices, making it harder for renters to afford a purchase later. |\n| **2. Equity\u2011price/wealth\u2011effect channel** | QE lifts stock prices; households with equity see higher net worth \u2192 may spend more. | Low\u2011income households typically hold <\u202f5\u202f% of wealth in equities (often only via a small 401(k) or a mutual fund). | **Positive:** Higher equity prices can raise the *valuation* of corporate pension plans that some low\u2011wage workers belong to (e.g., public\u2011sector pensions). <br>**Negative:** The wealth gap widens; the \u201crich get richer\u201d narrative can affect political support for redistribution. |\n| **3. Housing\u2011price channel** | QE can push up house prices via lower yields and portfolio reallocation. | Renters own no house; price rises do not directly increase their net worth. | **Positive:** If higher prices trigger new construction, more rental units may become available, potentially softening rent growth. <br>**Negative:** Higher home prices often translate into *higher rents* because landlords use the same market forces (e.g., higher property taxes, higher replacement cost) to raise rents. |\n| **4. Credit\u2011availability channel** | Banks end up with excess reserves; they may lower rates on other loans (auto, student, credit\u2011card). | Many low\u2011income households are \u201ccredit\u2011constrained\u201d (poor credit scores, limited documentation). | **Positive:** If banks loosen underwriting standards, some borrowers can obtain cheaper auto or student loans. <br>**Negative:** Looser standards can also lead to higher default risk and later tightening that disproportionately hurts marginal borrowers. |\n| **5. Employment\u2011and\u2011wage channel** | By lowering financing costs, QE stimulates investment and, through the \u201caggregate\u2011demand\u201d boost, can raise output and employment. | The *type* of jobs created matters. QE\u2011stimulated growth tends to be in sectors that require higher skills (professional services, tech, capital\u2011intensive manufacturing). | **Positive:** Overall unemployment falls; low\u2011skill workers may see *some* job openings. <br>**Negative:** Wage growth for low\u2011skill workers is modest; many new jobs are part\u2011time or gig\u2011economy positions with limited benefits. |\n| **6. Inflation\u2011expectations channel** | QE can raise expected inflation \u2192 central bank may tolerate higher price growth. | Low\u2011income households spend a larger share of income on necessities (food, energy, transportation). | **Negative:** Even a modest rise in CPI (e.g., 1\u20132\u202fpp) can erode real purchasing power for those on fixed or low wages, unless wages keep pace",

Quick \u201cheadline\u201d summary\n\n| Channel | Typical direction of the effect on renters / low\u2011income households | How strong the effect is (according to the bulk of the literature) | Main caveats / sources of uncertainty |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Mortgage\u2011rate / borrowing\u2011cost channel** | **Indirectly positive** \u2013 cheaper credit for new mortgages can *slow* rent growth (if more people can afford to buy) but the direct impact on renters is modest because they rarely refinance or take new mortgages. | Small to moderate (0\u20115\u202f% of household\u2011budget impact). | Effect depends on the *elasticity* of the rental market and on whether credit actually reaches low\u2011income borrowers. |\n| **General\u2011interest\u2011rate channel (bank funding costs)** | **Potentially negative** \u2013 lower policy rates can compress banks\u2019 net\u2011interest margins, leading some banks to raise fees on checking/savings accounts or to tighten credit standards for sub\u2011prime borrowers. | Small (average fee increase \u2248\u202f$10\u2011$30 per household per year) but can be larger for \u201cunbanked\u201d or \u201cunder\u2011banked\u201d people. | Evidence varies across countries and over time; some banks absorb the margin compression instead of passing costs to customers. |\n| **Asset\u2011price channel** | **Negative for renters** \u2013 rising house prices can push up *rents* (especially in tight housing markets) because landlords\u2019 property values and mortgage costs rise, and they pass a portion of those costs to tenants. | Moderately strong in high\u2011demand metros (rent growth 2\u20115\u202f% per year attributable to QE in some studies). | Effect is mediated by local housing\u2011supply constraints, rent\u2011control policies, and the share of renters vs owners. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect / confidence channel** | **Mixed** \u2013 higher consumer confidence can raise labor\u2011market participation and wages, but the boost is disproportionately captured by higher\u2011skill workers; low\u2011skill workers see only a modest spill\u2011over. | Small to negligible on average wages of low\u2011income workers (\u2248\u202f0\u20110.5\u202f% wage increase). | Evidence on \u201cconfidence\u2011driven spending\u201d is mixed; many low\u2011income households are credit\u2011constrained, limiting their ability to translate confidence into consumption. |\n| **Currency\u2011depreciation / export\u2011stimulus channel** | **Potentially positive** \u2013 a weaker currency can raise demand for domestically produced goods, creating or preserving low\u2011skill jobs in export\u2011oriented sectors (e.g., manufacturing, logistics). | Small to moderate (employment effects of 0.2\u20110.5\u202f% of total employment in the U.S. per 100\u202fbp of QE\u2011induced depreciation). | Effect depends on the openness of the economy, the share of export\u2011oriented jobs, and the speed of exchange\u2011rate pass\u2011through to wages. |\n| **Inflation\u2011redistribution channel** | **Potentially negative** \u2013 QE can eventually lead to higher inflation, which erodes the real value of fixed\u2011income benefits (e.g., Social Security, low\u2011wage contracts) if adjustments are slow. | Moderate (0.2\u20110.5\u202f% of real income loss for low\u2011wage earners per year of 1\u202f% inflation). | Inflation outcomes of QE have varied widely; in many advanced economies QE has been *deflationary* or neutral rather than inflationary. |\n\n> **Bottom line:**  \n> For renters and low\u2011income workers, the *most salient* QE\u2011related forces are **(i) higher rents driven by rising house prices** and **(ii) the indirect labor\u2011market effects of a weaker currency**. The net impact is *context\u2011dependent*: in tight housing markets QE can be a net cost, whereas in export\u2011oriented regions it can be a modest net benefit.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
