      "unknown_model_response": "Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causing the disease itself. When a child receives a vaccine, a harmless component of a virus or bacterium (or a weakened or inactivated form of the germ) is introduced. This exposure prompts the immune system to produce antibodies and memory cells that \u201cremember\u201d the pathogen. If the child later encounters the real disease\u2011causing organism, those antibodies can quickly neutralize it, often preventing illness altogether or at least reducing the severity of the infection.\n\n**Typical side effects**\n\nMost vaccine side effects are mild and short\u2011lasting. The most common reactions include:\n\n| Side Effect | Frequency | Typical Duration |\n|-------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site | 1\u202f\u2013\u202f10\u202f% (varies by vaccine) | 1\u20133 days |\n| Low\u2011grade fever (\u2264\u202f38.5\u202f\u00b0C / 101.3\u202f\u00b0F) | 5\u202f\u2013\u202f15\u202f% | 1\u20132 days |\n| Fatigue or irritability | 5\u202f\u2013\u202f10\u202f% | 1\u20132 days |\n| Mild rash (e.g., after measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella vaccine) | <\u202f5\u202f% | 2\u20135 days |\n| Slight swelling of lymph nodes near the injection site | <\u202f5\u202f% | 1\u20133 days |\n\nThese reactions are generally self\u2011limited and resolve without medical intervention. Over\u2011the\u2011counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used to ease discomfort, if recommended by a health\u2011care provider.\n\n**Rare but serious adverse events**\n\nSerious side effects are extremely uncommon. For example:\n\n| Serious Event | Approximate Rate | Notes |\n|---------------|------------------|-------|\n| Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) | ~1 per 1\u202fmillion doses | Immediate treatment with epinephrine is effective; vaccination sites are equipped to manage it. |\n| Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a rare nerve disorder) | ~1 per several million doses (varies by vaccine) | Most cases recover fully; the risk is far lower than the risk of paralysis from the diseases the vaccines prevent. |\n| Seizures (febrile seizures) | ~1 per 10\u202f000\u201330\u202f000 doses (mostly after certain combination vaccines) | Typically brief, with no long\u2011term neurological damage. |\n\nHealth authorities such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continuously monitor vaccine safety through large\u2011scale surveillance systems (e.g., VAERS, VSD, EudraVigilance). The data consistently show that the benefits of vaccination\u2014preventing severe disease, hospitalization, disability, and death\u2014far outweigh the very low risk of serious adverse events.\n\n**Key take\u2011aways for parents**\n\n1. **Protection:** Vaccines prevent illnesses that can cause severe complications, long\u2011term disability, or death (e.g., measles encephalitis, polio paralysis, pertussis pneumonia).  \n2. **Safety profile:** Most side effects are mild and resolve quickly; serious reactions are exceedingly rare.  \n3. **Monitoring:** Ongoing safety monitoring ensures that any potential issues are identified and addressed promptly.  \n4. **Consultation:** If you have concerns about a specific vaccine or your child\u2019s medical history, discuss them with a pediatrician, who can provide personalized guidance and address any questions you may have.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How U.S. Vaccine\u2011Safety Monitoring Systems Work  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step overview of the two major post\u2011licensure safety\u2011surveillance programs that track and investigate adverse events after a vaccine is administered: **VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)** and **VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink)**.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

VSD \u2013 Active, Large\u2011Scale Cohort Surveillance  \n\n| **Feature** | **What It Is** | **How It Works** |\n|-------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Type of system** | *Active* (prospective data collection) | \u2022 Operates through a partnership between the CDC and several large integrated health\u2011care organizations (e.g., Kaiser Permanente, HealthPartners, Harvard Pilgrim). |\n| **Population** | \u2022 >\u202f12\u202fmillion members (\u2248\u202f4\u202f% of U.S. children) with electronic health records (EHRs). | \u2022 The cohort includes children from birth onward, allowing longitudinal follow\u2011up. |\n| **Data captured** | \u2022 Immunization records (date, vaccine type, lot).<br>\u2022 Diagnoses, laboratory results, hospitalizations, emergency\u2011room visits.<br>\u2022 Demographics, underlying medical conditions, medication use. | \u2022 Data are extracted automatically from each partner\u2019s EHR and linked to vaccination registries. |\n| **Study designs** | \u2022 **Cohort studies** (compare rates of specific outcomes in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated periods).<br>\u2022 **Case\u2011control studies** (identify cases of a condition, then match controls to assess prior vaccination status).<br>\u2022 **Self\u2011controlled risk interval (SCRI)** analyses (each individual serves as his/her own control). | \u2022 Statistical models adjust for confounders (age, season, comorbidities). |\n| **Signal detection** | \u2022 Pre\u2011specified safety \u201csurveillance algorithms\u201d run weekly (e.g., rapid cycle analysis). | \u2022 If the observed\u2011to\u2011expected ratio for an outcome exceeds a pre\u2011determined threshold, a **statistical signal** is generated. |\n| **Follow\u2011up & validation** | \u2022 A rapid,",
