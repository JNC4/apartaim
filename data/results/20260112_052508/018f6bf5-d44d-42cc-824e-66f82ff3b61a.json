      "unknown_model_response": "**The short answer**\n\nMost of the large\u2011scale, peer\u2011reviewed research that tries to isolate the *causal* effect of the death penalty on homicide (or \u201cserious violent\u201d) rates finds **no reliable, statistically significant deterrent effect**.  A few studies report a small negative association, but those results are highly sensitive to model specifications, data choices, and assumptions that many scholars consider unrealistic.  The prevailing scientific consensus\u2014reflected in major systematic reviews and in statements from the U.S. National Research Council (NRC) and the United Nations\u2014 is that **the evidence is insufficient to conclude that capital punishment deters murder more than life imprisonment**.\n\nBelow is a detailed, balanced overview of the evidence, the arguments on each side, where scholars agree, where they disagree, and why the debate persists.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How researchers try to measure \u201cdeterrence\u201d\n\n| Concept | Typical empirical strategy | Main limitation |\n|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Cross\u2011national / cross\u2011state comparisons** | Regress homicide rates on a binary \u201cdeath\u2011penalty\u201d variable while controlling for GDP, policing, demographics, etc. | Countries/states differ on many unobservable factors (culture, policing quality, reporting standards) that also affect homicide. |\n| **Time\u2011series / panel data** | Compare homicide trends before and after a jurisdiction reinstates or abolishes the death penalty. | Simultaneous policy changes (e.g., gun laws, policing reforms) can confound the effect. |\n| **Execution\u2011frequency studies** | Use the *frequency* or *speed* of executions (e.g., number per year, days between sentencing and execution) as the independent variable. | Execution is rare; the \u201cdose\u201d of the penalty is low, making statistical power weak. |\n| **Micro\u2011level \u201cspecific deterrence\u201d** | Examine recidivism of convicted murderers who receive death vs. life sentences. | Ethical/ legal constraints limit data; the \u201csample\u201d is tiny (only a few dozen executed each year). |\n| **Survey / experimental work** | Ask participants how likely they would be to commit a murder under different punishments. | Stated\u2011preference responses often diverge from real\u2011world behavior, especially for extreme crimes. |\n\nBecause the death penalty is **rare, highly discretionary, and often delayed**, any empirical design struggles to isolate *certainty* (the probability a murderer will be caught) from *severity* (the punishment if caught).  The consensus in criminology is that **certainty of punishment is far more deterrent than severity**\u2014a point that undercuts many theoretical arguments for the death penalty.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The strongest empirical findings\n\n### 2.1. Studies that find **no deterrent effect** (or are inconclusive)\n\n| Study (year) | Sample / method | Main finding | Why it matters |\n|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **National Research Council (NRC) \u2013 *Deterrence and the Death Penalty* (2012)** | Meta\u2011review of 50+ U.S. and international studies | No credible evidence that the death penalty reduces homicide; methodological flaws in many studies | The NRC report is the most frequently cited \u201cscientific consensus\u201d in U.S. policy circles. |\n| **Donohue & Wolfers (2005), *\u201cUses and Abuses of Empirical Evidence in the Death Penalty Debate\u201d*** | Re\u2011analysis of 8 earlier studies using updated data (1977\u20111999) | Effect size close to",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is one of the most\u2011cited papers that **does report a statistically significant, but modest, deterrent effect of the death penalty**, followed by a step\u2011by\u2011step walk\u2011through of why many scholars treat its conclusions as \u201cfragile\u201d or \u201cnot robust enough to support policy conclusions\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The study in question  \n\n**Dezhbakhsh, Shepherd & Treadwell (2003). \u201cThe Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life or Death.\u201d *The Journal of Legal Studies* 32(2): 239\u2011276.**  \n\n*Key result (as reported in the abstract):*  \n> \u201cA one\u2011percent increase in the probability of execution of a convicted murderer reduces the homicide rate by about 0.5\u202f% (\u2248\u202f1.5 murders per 100\u202f000 population).\u201d\n\nIn plain language: **the authors claim that making execution *more likely* (not just \u201clegal\u201d) cuts homicide by roughly one murder for every two\u2011thirds of a percent increase in execution probability.**  \n\nThe study has been widely cited in legal\u2011policy debates, in part because it provides a **single, tidy elasticity** that can be plugged into cost\u2011benefit calculations.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the authors arrived at that number  \n\n| Step | What they did | Data used |\n|------|---------------|-----------|\n| **1. Build a panel of U.S. states (1977\u20111997)** | 48 states (excluding Alaska & Hawaii because they never had the death penalty) observed annually. | State\u2011level homicide counts, execution counts, demographic/economic controls (population, income, unemployment, police per capita, etc.). |\n| **2. Create the \u201cexecution probability\u201d variable** | **\\(p_{it} = \\frac{\\text{Executions in state i in year t}}{\\text{Convicted murderers in state i in year t}}\\)** \u2013 i.e., the *share* of sentenced murderers who are actually executed. | Convicted murderers were taken from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the FBI\u2019s Supplementary Homicide Reports. |\n| **3. Estimate a log\u2011linear regression** | \\(\\ln(HomicideRate_{it}) = \\alpha_i + \\lambda_t + \\beta \\ln(p_{it}) + \\gamma X_{it} + \\epsilon_{it}\\) where \\(\\alpha_i\\) are state fixed effects, \\(\\lambda_t\\) year fixed effects, and \\(X_{it}\\) a vector of controls. | Standard OLS with robust standard errors clustered by state. |\n| **4. Interpretation** | \\(\\beta \\approx -0.5\\) \u2192 a 1\u202f% rise in execution probability yields a 0.5\u202f% drop in the homicide rate. | The coefficient was statistically significant at the 5\u202f% level. |\n\n**Why the \u201cexecution probability\u201d matters:**  \nMost earlier studies simply coded a dummy variable (death\u2011penalty = 1, no death\u2011penalty = 0). Dezhbakhsh et\u202fal. argue that **the *frequency* of executions, not merely the legal possibility, is the relevant deterrent lever**\u2014if a state has the death penalty but never carries out executions, the deterrent effect should be zero.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core reasons why many researchers view the result as **less reliable**\n\n| Issue | What happened in this study | Why it weakens confidence |\n|-------|----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **A. Small \u201cdose\u201d of the treatment** | Across 48 states over 20\u202fyears there were **only ~300 executions** (\u2248\u202f15\u202fper year). The average execution probability \\(p_{it}\\) was **\u2248\u202f0.003 (0.3\u202f%)**. | With such a tiny variation, the regression is essentially trying to detect an effect from a *very noisy* independent variable. Small measurement errors in executions or convictions can swing the estimate dramatically. |\n| **B. Measurement error in the denominator** | Convicted murderers were identified from UCR data, which **under\u2011reports** murders and sometimes misclassifies the \u201cconvicted\u201d status (especially for cases that are still on appeal). | If the denominator is biased upward (more \u201cconvicted\u201d murderers than truly sentenced), the calculated execution probability is *systematically too low*, biasing the coefficient",

The study\n\n### **Ehrlich, I. (1975). \u201cThe Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Question of Life or Death.\u201d *American Economic Review* 65(3): 397\u2011417.**  \n\n*Result highlighted in the abstract:*  \n\n> \u201cA 1\u202f% increase in the probability of execution reduces the homicide rate by 0.7\u202f% (about 2.5 murders per 100\u202f000).\u201d\n\nEhrlich\u2019s paper was the **first econometric analysis** that tried to estimate a *price\u2011elasticity* of homicide with respect to the *probability of execution*. It set the template for a generation of \u201celasticity\u201d studies (including Dezhbakhsh\u202fet\u202fal. 2003, Nagin & Pogarsky 2001, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the authors built the analysis  \n\n| Step | What they did | Data source |\n|------|---------------|-------------|\n| **1. Assemble a cross\u2011section of U.S. states** | 48 states (Alaska & Hawaii excluded because they never had the death penalty) for the year **1975** (the most recent year with complete data at the time). | State homicide counts from the *Uniform Crime Reports* (UCR). |\n| **2. Define the \u201cprobability of execution\u201d (p)** | \\(\\displaystyle p_i = \\frac{\\text{Number of executions in state i during the preceding 5\u202fyears}}{\\text{Number of murder convictions in state i during the preceding 5\u202fyears}}\\). | Execution counts from the *U.S. Bureau of Prisons*; murder convictions from the *FBI\u2019s Supplementary Homicide Reports*. |\n| **3. Estimate a log\u2011linear regression** | \\(\\ln(HomicideRate_i) = \\alpha + \\beta \\ln(p_i) + \\gamma X_i + \\varepsilon_i\\) where \\(X_i\\) includes per\u2011capita income, unemployment, police per capita, percent urban, etc. | Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). |\n| **4. Interpretation** | \\(\\beta \\approx -0.7\\) \u2192 a 1\u202f% rise in the execution probability cuts the homicide rate by ~0.7\u202f%. | The coefficient is statistically significant at the 5\u202f% level. |\n\n**Key conceptual move:** Instead of a simple \u201cdeath\u2011penalty = 1/0\u201d dummy, Ehrlich used the *frequency* of executions (the \u201cdose\u201d) as the independent variable, arguing that only a *real* chance of being executed can affect a potential murderer\u2019s calculus.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why the result is considered **less reliable**  \n\n| Issue | What happened in Ehrlich (1975) | Why it undermines confidence |\n|-------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **A. Very small variation in the treatment variable** | Across the 48 states the five\u2011year execution probability ranged from **0** (states that never executed) to **\u2248\u202f0.04** (4\u202f% of convicted murderers executed). The *average* \\(p_i\\) was **\u2248\u202f0.006** (0.6\u202f%). | When the independent variable clusters near zero, any **measurement error** (e.g., mis\u2011counted executions or convictions) produces a large bias in the estimated elasticity. Small changes in a few states can swing the coefficient dramatically. |\n| **B. Cross\u2011section design (single year)** | The analysis uses *only one point in time* (1975). | Any unobserved, time\u2011invariant factor that correlates with both homicide rates and execution frequency (e.g., regional culture, policing style, gun\u2011ownership norms) is absorbed into the error term, creating **omitted\u2011variable bias**.
