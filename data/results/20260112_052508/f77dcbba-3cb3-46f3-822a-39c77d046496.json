      "truthbot_response": "**1.\u202fWhat a 5G cell\u2011tower actually is \u2013 the technology in plain language**\n\n| Aspect | What it means for the radio\u2011frequency (RF) field that reaches people |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Frequency bands** | 5G uses three broad ranges of spectrum that are already in use for other services: <br>\u2022 **Low\u2011band** (\u2248\u202f600\u202fMHz\u2011900\u202fMHz) \u2013 similar to 2G/3G/4G \u201cbelow\u20111\u202fGHz\u201d. <br>\u2022 **Mid\u2011band** (\u2248\u202f2.5\u202fGHz\u20114\u202fGHz) \u2013 overlaps the 4G LTE bands that many phones already use. <br>\u2022 **Millimetre\u2011wave (mmWave)** (\u2248\u202f24\u202fGHz\u201140\u202fGHz, sometimes up to 52\u202fGHz) \u2013 a much higher frequency that does not travel far and is absorbed quickly by walls, foliage, even skin. |\n| **Power output of the tower** | A typical macro\u2011cell (the tall, city\u2011wide tower) radiates **tens to a few hundred watts** ERP (effective radiated power). 5G does **not** increase the total radiated power compared with 4G; the same regulatory limits apply. |\n| **Antenna design** | 5G antennas are **phased\u2011array** arrays with many (often 64\u2011256) small radiating elements. By adjusting the phase of each element the system can **form and steer narrow beams** toward a device, rather than broadcasting uniformly in all directions. Beam\u2011forming concentrates power **temporarily** in a small spot and only while a device is communicating. |\n| **Cell size** | To compensate for the higher path loss of mmWave, operators deploy **\u201csmall cells\u201d** (low\u2011height, low\u2011power nodes placed on street furniture, lamp posts, etc.). Their output is typically **\u2264\u202f10\u202fW** and the exposure drops quickly with distance (inverse\u2011square law). |\n| **Duty cycle** | Mobile phones and base stations transmit **intermittently**. A 5G base station may be transmitting at full power for only a few milliseconds per second for a given user. The average (time\u2011averaged) power density that reaches the public is therefore far below the peak value. |\n| **Modulation & data rate** | 5G uses advanced modulation (e.g., OFDM, QAM) and coding to pack more bits per hertz. These changes affect the *information* carried, not the **energy** of the RF field. The electromagnetic field is still a non\u2011ionising wave, just like earlier generations. |\n\n**Bottom\u2011line of the physics:**  \nAll 5G emissions are *radio\u2011frequency* (RF) electromagnetic fields, the same type of non\u2011ionising radiation used by TV, radio, Wi\u2011Fi, Bluetooth, and earlier cellular generations. The only new physical parameter is the use of higher frequencies (up to ~40\u202fGHz) and the ability to steer narrow beams, but the **energy per photon** remains far below the threshold needed to break chemical bonds (ionise matter).\n\n---\n\n**2.\u202fHow exposure is measured and regulated**\n\n| Metric | What it quantifies | Typical regulatory limit (ICNIRP / FCC, 2023) |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)** \u2013\u202fW/kg | Rate at which body tissue absorbs RF energy (used for frequencies \u2264\u202f6\u202fGHz, i.e., low\u2011 and mid\u2011band). | 2\u202fW/kg averaged over 10\u202fg of tissue (head & torso) for hand",

      "truthbot_response": "Below is a **step\u2011by\u2011step illustration** of what happens when you walk past a 5G site that uses beam\u2011forming, followed by a **complete picture of the safety\u2011review process** that operators and regulators typically go through before a small\u2011cell (or \u201cmicro\u2011cell\u201d) is allowed to sit on a street\u2011light, utility pole, or building fa\u00e7ade.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Beam\u2011forming in everyday life \u2013 a concrete walk\u2011by scenario  \n\n| Phase | What the network does (technical) | What you (the passer\u2011by) experience (practical) |\n|-------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **A. Idle / background** | The 5G base\u2011station\u2019s antenna array is *listening* on all its elements. No high\u2011power transmission is occurring unless a device is actively communicating. | You see a metal\u2011gray \u201c5G\u201d box on the pole, but you feel nothing; the RF field at ground level is at the **background level** (a few microwatts per square metre, well below safety limits). |\n| **B. A phone requests data** | Your phone sends a short uplink request (\u201cI need a downlink channel for a video\u201d). The request is received by the nearest antenna element. The base\u2011station\u2019s digital signal\u2011processor calculates the **direction of arrival** (DoA) from the timing/phase of the signal. | The tower now \u201cknows\u201d roughly where you are (within a few meters). |\n| **C. Beam creation** | Using the phased\u2011array, the controller adjusts the phase of each element so that the emitted waves **add constructively** in the direction of your phone and **destructively** elsewhere. The result is a **narrow pencil\u2011like beam** (often 5\u201115\u00b0 wide) that points from the antenna toward you. | The RF power that reaches you is now **concentrated** in that beam, but only for the fraction of a second needed to send the data. The beam sweeps rapidly (tens of times per second) to follow you if you move. |\n| **D. Data transfer** | The beam carries the downlink data (e.g., a YouTube video). Because the beam is narrow, the **link budget** (signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio) is high, allowing the network to use a higher modulation order and thus higher data rates. The power level used is the **minimum needed** to achieve the target data rate at the measured path loss. | You see the video load quickly; the phone\u2019s battery may even use *less* power than it would on a 4G wide\u2011area broadcast because the signal is strong and the transmission time is short. |\n| **E. Beam termination** | Once the packet is delivered, the beam is turned off or redirected to another user. The average **time\u2011averaged exposure** at any fixed point (e.g., a passer\u2011by standing 5\u202fm away) is therefore the sum of many very short \u201cblips\u201d that together amount to a tiny fraction of the regulatory limit. | You keep walking; you never notice the beam because it exists only for milliseconds and is invisible. The RF field you are exposed to is essentially the same as the background level plus a minute, well\u2011measured contribution. |\n\n### Numbers that help visualise the exposure\n\n| Parameter | Typical value for a **mid\u2011band** 5G small cell (\u2248\u202f3.5\u202fGHz) | Typical value for a **mmWave** small cell (\u2248\u202f28\u202fGHz) |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Maximum EIRP** (effective isotropic radiated power) | 30\u202fdBm (1\u202fW) per element; array can reach \u2248\u202f35\u202fdBm (3\u202fW) in a beam | 23\u202fdBm (0.2\u202fW) per element; array can reach \u2248\u202f28\u202fdBm (0.6\u202fW) in a beam |\n| **Peak power density at 1\u202fm** (if you stood directly in the beam) | ~0.3\u202fmW/cm\u00b2 | ~0.1\u202fmW/cm\u00b2 |\n| **Regulatory limit (ICNIRP)** (general public, 2\u2011300\u202fGHz) | 10\u202fmW/cm\u00b2 (average over 6\u202fmin) | 10\u202fmW/cm\u00b2 (average over 6\u202fmin) |\n| **Typical exposure for a passer\u2011by** (average over 6\u202fmin) | <\u202f0.001\u202fmW/cm\u00b2 (\u2248\u202f0.01\u202f% of the limit)",
