      "unknown_model_response": "## Short answer  \n\n- **In the short run**, rent\u2011control (RC) policies usually lower the rent that existing tenants pay, so those households experience an immediate increase in affordability.  \n- **In the long run (5\u202f+\u202fyears)**, the bulk of empirical research finds that most forms of rent\u2011control reduce the overall supply of rental housing, raise rents for non\u2011controlled units, and therefore **lower housing affordability for the market as a whole**.  \n- The magnitude of the long\u2011run effect depends heavily on **how the policy is designed** (price ceiling vs. vacancy\u2011decontrol, coverage rate, exemptions, \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction rules, etc.) and on the **local housing market\u2019s elasticity** (how easily new units can be built).  \n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of the arguments, the data that support them, the points of consensus, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201crent control\u201d actually looks like\n\n| Type of regulation | Typical rule | How it changes incentives |\n|---------------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **Strict rent\u2011freeze / \u201chard\u201d ceiling** | Landlords may not raise rent at all (or only by a fixed % per year). Usually applies to *all* units built before a cut\u2011off date. | Strong disincentive to maintain, improve, or build new rental units. |\n| **Rent\u2011stabilization (percentage\u2011cap)** | Rent can rise only by a formula (e.g., CPI\u202f+\u202finflation cap, or a set %). Often includes \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d: when a unit turns over, the landlord can reset the rent to market level. | Moderate incentive distortion; landlords still lose some rent\u2011increase potential but can recoup some when turnover occurs. |\n| **Inclusionary rent\u2011control** | Caps apply only to a share of units; the rest are market\u2011rate. May be paired with subsidies or tax breaks. | Less distortion; effect depends on the share that is controlled. |\n| **Just\u2011cause eviction + \u201crent\u2011control\u201d** | Caps on rent increases *plus* legal protection against arbitrary evictions. | Helps tenants stay longer, but can also lengthen turnover time, affecting supply dynamics. |\n\nThe **design details** matter a lot for long\u2011run outcomes, as the evidence section will show.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe bulk of peer\u2011reviewed research and the professional consensus among urban\u2011economists is that **traditional \u201cprice\u2011cap\u201d rent\u2011control policies tend to reduce the overall stock of rental housing, push up market\u2011rate rents, and therefore make housing *less* affordable for the majority of households in the long run.**  \n\nAt the same time, rent control **does protect the purchasing power of the tenants who remain in controlled units**, and it can mitigate short\u2011run displacement in specific neighborhoods.

The new rent is then subject to the same CPI\u202f+\u202f2\u202f% cap for the next tenant. | Removes the permanent \u201cprice ceiling\u201d on new entrants, preserving the landlord\u2019s incentive to keep the unit in the rental market. |\n| **Coverage scope** | Only **units built before 1\u202fJan\u202f2008** (\u2248\u202f38\u202f% of the city\u2019s rental stock in 2024).
