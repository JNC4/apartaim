Fluoride can replace the hydroxyl ion to form **fluoro\u2011apatite** (Ca\u2081\u2080(PO\u2084)\u2086F\u2082), which is more resistant to acid dissolution. |\n| **Remineralisation** | When a tooth surface is de\u2011mineralised by plaque acids, fluoride in saliva helps drive calcium and phosphate back into the crystal lattice, repairing early lesions. |\n| **Antibacterial effect** | At the low concentrations found in fluoridated water (\u22480.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9) fluoride modestly inhibits the metabolism of *Streptococcus mutans*, the bacteria most responsible for caries. |\n\n**Result:** Populations that receive water with \u22480.7\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 fluoride experience ~20\u201330\u202f% fewer dental caries compared with similar groups that receive non\u2011fluoridated water (U.S. CDC, \u201cCommunity Water Fluoridation\u201d 2022; systematic review by Iheozor-Ejiofor et\u202fal., *Cochrane Database* 2021).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

What does *mild* dental fluorosis look like?\n\n| Feature | Description | Clinical significance |\n|---------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| **Location** | Usually first (front) permanent incisors and canines, because they develop while the child is still drinking fluoridated water (\u2248 ages 1\u20116). | The teeth most visible when you smile. |\n| **Visual pattern** | \u2022 **Thin, white opaque lines** that run across the surface of the enamel (often called \u201cstriations\u201d).  <br>\u2022 **Small, scattered white spots** or \u201cflecks\u201d that may be barely perceptible unless you look closely. | The enamel surface is still smooth; the appearance is purely cosmetic. |\n| **Severity rating** (Dean\u2019s Fluorosis Index, the classic clinical scale) | **\u201cQuestionable\u201d / \u201cVery mild\u201d** (score\u202f=\u202f1) \u2013 faint, barely noticeable white patches covering <\u202f25\u202f% of the labial surface. | No impact on tooth strength, sensitivity, or function. |\n| **Photographic example** | Imagine a thin, chalky line that follows the incisal edge of a front tooth, or a few tiny specks that look like a \u201cdusting\u201d of flour. | If you were to take a close\u2011up photo, the spots would appear as a subtle contrast against the normal translucent enamel. |\n\n#### Why it\u2019s considered \u201cmild\u201d\n\n- **Structural integrity:** Fluorosis only changes the *appearance* of the outer enamel layer; the crystal lattice remains intact, so the tooth is just as strong as a non\u2011fluorosed tooth.\n- **Functional impact:** There is no increase in tooth decay, sensitivity, or pain associated with mild fluorosis.\n- **Aesthetic perception:** In most surveys, people with very mild fluorosis rarely notice it themselves, and dental professionals often consider it an acceptable trade\u2011off for the population\u2011wide reduction in cavities that fluoridation provides.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

FA is **~10\u201330\u202f% less soluble** at the same pH, so less mineral is lost. |\n| **Re\u2011mineralisation** (when pH rises back to ~6.8) | Calcium and phosphate from saliva redeposit, but the new crystals are still HA and are relatively weak. | Fluoride acts as a **catalyst** that attracts calcium and phosphate to the demineralised area. The precipitating crystal is **fluoro\u2011apatite**, which is harder and more acid\u2011resistant. |\n| **Bacterial metabolism** | *Streptococcus mutans* produces lactic acid efficiently, keeping plaque pH low. | Fluoride at \u22480.1\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 (the concentration that actually reaches plaque after a glass of water) **inhibits enolase**, an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway.

Fluoride in saliva acts as a **catalyst**: it binds calcium and phosphate to form a **fluoridated \u201cprecursor\u201d** that quickly redeposits on the enamel surface, rebuilding the crystal lattice. | The net effect is a **faster repair** of early, microscopic lesions (\u201cwhite\u2011spot lesions\u201d) than would occur without fluoride. |\n| **Inhibition of bacterial metabolism** | Fluoride (as HF at low pH) diffuses into bacterial cells and **inhibits enolase**, a key enzyme in glycolysis.
