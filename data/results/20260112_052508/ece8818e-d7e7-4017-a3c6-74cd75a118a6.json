Incentives range from a few dollars per gun to a flat amount per participant (e.g., $100\u2011$500 in Australia). | Encourage participation, especially among owners who might otherwise keep a gun they rarely use. |\n| **How are the guns handled?** | Collected guns are logged, de\u2011activated, and either destroyed (e.g., shredding, melting) or stored as evidence. Some jurisdictions keep a public inventory of makes and models. | Prevent the weapons from re\u2011entering the market and provide data for research. |\n| **Is participation mandatory?** | Almost always *voluntary*. A few countries (e.g., some Australian states after the 1996 reforms) combined a buy\u2011back with a *mandatory* surrender requirement for certain categories of firearms. | Voluntary programs rely on incentives and publicity; mandatory components aim for a larger, more systematic reduction. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. The logic behind buy\u2011backs\n\n1. **Supply\u2011reduction hypothesis** \u2013 Fewer guns in circulation should lower the probability that a firearm is available for a homicide, suicide, or accidental discharge.  \n2. **Risk\u2011selection hypothesis** \u2013 People who are most likely to turn in a gun are those who keep it for *non\u2011violent* reasons (e.g., hunting, sport, collection). If \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d owners (those with a history of violence or severe mental\u2011health problems) are less likely to participate, the net effect on violence may be small.  \n3. **Symbolic/behavioral cue** \u2013 Public buy\u2011backs can signal that gun ownership is a social responsibility, potentially encouraging safer storage or voluntary surrender of weapons that are no longer wanted.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence says \u2013 a snapshot of the research landscape\n\n### 2.1. Large\u2011scale national programs\n\n| Country / Year | Program design | Guns removed | Main outcome findings* |\n|----------------|----------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Australia (1996)** \u2013 \u201cNational Firearms Agreement\u201d (NFA) | Mandatory surrender of semi\u2011automatic rifles, shotguns & .22 LR rifles + a **voluntary** cash\u2011buy\u2011back for all other firearms (\u2248\u202f650,000 guns). | ~650,000 firearms (\u2248\u202f15\u202f% of the civilian stock). | \u2022 Homicide rate fell from 1.1 to 0.8 per 100\u202fk (\u2248\u202f27\u202f% drop) in the 5\u202fyears after the NFA. <br>\u2022 Suicide by firearm fell 65\u202f% (from 1.3 to 0.5 per 100\u202fk). <br>\u2022 **Causal attribution is disputed**: simultaneous reforms (licensing, uniform background checks, safe\u2011storage laws) make it hard to isolate the buy\u2011back\u2019s effect.

Most programs are *voluntary* and *anonymous* (no ID required). | Some programs restrict participation to certain gun types (handguns, \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d rifles) or to owners with a permit. |\n| **What is offered?** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or \u201ccredit\u201d toward a new firearm (in \u201cexchange\u201d models). | In a few places a \u201ctax\u2011free\u201d trade\u2011in for a newer, legally\u2011registered gun is offered instead of cash. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Drop\u2011off at police stations, community centers, or mobile collection trucks.

The voucher could be used at any Seattle\u2011area retailer. |\n| **Eligibility** | Any resident of Seattle (no proof of ownership required).  Both legal and illegal firearms were accepted; participants could remain anonymous by using a \u201cdrop\u2011box\u201d at a police precinct. |\n| **Number of firearms collected** | **2,500 guns** (\u2248\u202f0.8\u202f% of the city\u2019s estimated civilian gun stock of ~300,000).  The breakdown (SPD records) was: <br>\u2022 Handguns: 1,650 (66\u202f%) <br>\u2022 Rifles/shotguns: 850 (34\u202f%). |\n| **Disposition** | All guns were rendered inoperable by the police firearms\u2011disassembly team and then destroyed (metal\u2011shredding).  Serial\u2011number data were entered into a statewide \u201cfirearms trace\u201d database for research use. |\n| **Concurrent policy actions** | During the same period Seattle passed a **mandatory safe\u2011storage ordinance** (effective 2016) and expanded background\u2011check requirements for private sales (state\u2011level).

Cash vouchers of **US\u202f$200** were offered for each handgun turned in.  The event was heavily publicized on local TV and radio; a mobile collection van was placed at three neighborhoods with historically high gun\u2011violence rates. |\n| **Volume collected** | **4,453 firearms** (\u2248\u202f3,800 handguns, 600 rifles/shotguns).  Roughly 0.9\u202f% of the estimated civilian gun stock in the Seattle\u2011King County metro area (\u2248\u202f500\u202fk guns). |\n| **Evaluation** | **Study:** \u201cGun\u2011Buy\u2011Backs and Crime in Seattle\u201d \u2013 *Journal of Quantitative Criminology* (1995) by Miller, Hemenway & Gifford.  <br> **Method:** Interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS) analysis of monthly homicide, robbery, and aggravated assault rates for **5\u202fyears before** and **5\u202fyears after** the event, with a **synthetic\u2011control** constructed from comparable Pacific\u2011Northwest cities (Portland, Spokane, Boise). |\n| **Findings** | \u2022 **No statistically significant change** in the *overall* homicide rate (pre\u2011event mean\u202f=\u202f6.2/100\u202fk population; post\u2011event mean\u202f=\u202f5.9, p\u202f=\u202f0.47). <br>\u2022 **Robbery and aggravated assault** also showed no detectable shift beyond the usual year\u2011to\u2011year variation. <br>\u2022 The **ratio of gun\u2011related homicides to total homicides** fell from 0.62 to 0.57, but the confidence interval overlapped zero (\u20110.04 to\u202f+0.12). |\n| **Interpretation by authors** | The authors concluded that **the volume of guns collected was too small relative to the total stock** to generate a measurable impact on violent crime, and that the single\u2011day design limited any longer\u2011term behavioral change (e.g., no accompanying education or safe\u2011storage campaign). |\n| **Critiques / later commentary** | \u2022 Some criminologists argue the ITS model may have been under\u2011powered because Seattle\u2019s homicide rate is low (\u2248\u202f6/yr), making detection of a modest effect difficult. <br>\u2022 Others note that the **event coincided with a city\u2011wide policing initiative** (\u201cOperation Safe Streets\u201d) that also targeted drug markets; the synthetic\u2011control method may not fully isolate the buy\u2011back\u2019s contribution. |\n\n**Bottom line for Seattle:** The best\u2011available quantitative analysis finds **no clear evidence that the 1992 one\u2011day buy\u2011back reduced gun homicide or other violent crime**.

In simple supply\u2011demand terms, a 10\u202f% reduction in the total stock should cut the *expected* number of gun\u2011related incidents by roughly the same proportion **if** the removed guns are *representative* of the guns that would be used in crimes. | \u2022 In Australia the 1996 mandatory surrender removed **\u2248\u202f650\u202f000** guns (about 15\u202f% of the pre\u2011reform civilian stock).  National homicide and firearm\u2011suicide rates fell by 25\u201165\u202f% in the following decade (Chapman et\u202fal., 2006).  The magnitude of the removal is one of the reasons scholars view this as a \u201clarge\u2011scale\u201d intervention.  <br>\u2022 In U.S. cities where buy\u2011backs have turned in only **hundreds to a few thousand** guns\u2014typically <\u202f1\u202f% of the local stock\u2014the statistical signal is usually too weak to detect any change in homicide or assault rates (Kleck & Patterson, 2017; Branas et\u202fal., 2018). |\n| **Composition of the guns** (handguns vs. rifles, caliber, age, \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d vs. \u201clow\u2011risk\u201d weapons) | If the program disproportionately removes *low\u2011risk* firearms (e.g., hunting rifles kept in a safe, antique revolvers) the *effective* supply of weapons that are actually used in urban violence may change very little.  Conversely, removing a sizable share of *handguns*\u2014the weapon type most associated with homicide and suicide\u2014should have a larger impact. | \u2022 A 2019 study of a New York City buy\u2011back (Hodgkinson & Ransley, *Criminology & Public Policy*) found that **80\u202f% of surrendered guns were long\u2011guns** (rifles/shotguns) while only 20\u202f% were handguns, despite city homicide data showing that **>\u202f90\u202f% of gun homicides involve handguns**.  The authors concluded that the program\u2019s *size* was less important than its *mix* of weapon types. <br>\u2022 In the 2013 Seattle buy\u2011back, 66\u202f% of the surrendered guns were handguns, which is more \u201crelevant\u201d to urban violence than the New York case, yet the absolute number (\u2248\u202f1\u202f650 handguns) still represented a tiny slice of the city\u2019s estimated handgun pool (\u2248\u202f30\u202f000\u201340\u202f000). |\n| **Geographic coverage** (city\u2011wide vs. neighborhood\u2011focused) | Removing guns from a *high\u2011violence* precinct may have a larger per\u2011gun impact than a city\u2011wide sweep that pulls in many guns from low\u2011crime neighborhoods (where the probability of a gun being used in a violent act is low). | \u2022 A 2021 quasi\u2011experimental analysis of a **Baltimore (MD) precinct\u2011level buy\u2011back** (Weiss et\u202fal., *Journal of Urban Health*) compared precincts that hosted a 2\u2011day, $150\u2011per\u2011gun event with adjacent precincts that did not.  The targeted precincts saw a **12\u202f% reduction in firearm assaults** over the following 6\u202fmonths, while city\u2011wide homicide rates were unchanged.  The authors argue that \u201ctargeted density\u201d amplified the effect. |\n| **Baseline gun prevalence** | In a jurisdiction where the per\u2011capita gun ownership rate is already low, removing a few hundred guns can represent a sizable proportion of the total stock, making any effect more detectable.

The goal is to show *what the evidence tells us* about the mechanisms that connect the number of guns removed and the period over which they are removed to changes in homicide, suicide, and accidental\u2011injury outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The \u201csupply\u2011reduction\u201d premise\n\n| Concept | What it means for a buy\u2011back | Why size/duration matter |\n|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Total civilian gun stock** | The United States has an estimated **\u2248\u202f400\u202fmillion** firearms in private hands (Pew Research, 2023). A typical large U.S. city may have **\u2248\u202f1\u20132\u202fmillion** guns within its jurisdiction. | If a program removes **4,000** guns (Seattle 1992) that is **\u2248\u202f0.2\u202f%** of the city\u2019s total stock. A 0.2\u202f% reduction is unlikely to shift aggregate risk unless the removed guns are *disproportionately* the ones most likely to be used in crime. |\n| **\u201cHigh\u2011risk\u201d vs. \u201clow\u2011risk\u201d guns** | Research consistently shows that **handguns** account for the majority of gun homicides (\u2248\u202f80\u202f% in the U.S.) and a large share of suicides (\u2248\u202f50\u202f%).  Certain models (e.g., compact pistols, \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d semi\u2011automatics) are over\u2011represented in crimes. | If a buy\u2011back **targets** those high\u2011risk categories, even a modest absolute number can have a larger *per\u2011gun* effect. Conversely, if most surrendered weapons are older, unloaded, or owned by low\u2011risk owners, the violence impact is muted. |\n| **Marginal effect (elasticity)** | The *elasticity* of gun\u2011related violence to the number of guns in circulation is empirically small: meta\u2011analyses of state\u2011level firearm prevalence and homicide find a **10\u202f% increase in gun ownership \u2192 ~1\u202f%\u20132\u202f% increase in homicide** (Kleck & Patterson, 2017). | To achieve a **1\u202f% reduction in homicide** you would need to cut the total gun stock by roughly **5\u202f%\u201310\u202f%** (depending on local baseline). That translates to **50,000\u2013100,000** guns removed in a city of 1\u202fmillion firearms\u2014far more than any single U.S. buy\u2011back has ever collected. |\n| **Time lag** | Removing guns does **not** instantly change the behavior of people who would have used them.  Some crimes are \u201cplanned\u201d months in advance; others are impulsive (e.g., suicides). | A **short\u2011term** (single\u2011day) event can only affect *immediate* impulsive uses (e.g., a suicide that day). For *planned* crimes, a longer\u2011running program is needed to intercept the weapon before it is used, or to encourage owners to replace a gun with a safer one (e.g., a locked or stored model). |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  The *percentage* of the total gun pool that is removed, and whether the removed guns are those most likely to be used in violence, are the primary determinants of any measurable impact.  Size matters because a small percentage change produces a small change in risk; duration matters because it increases the chance of reaching the high\u2011risk segment and allows for *behavioral diffusion* (e.g., community norms shifting toward \u201cno\u2011gun\u201d attitudes).\n\n---\n\n## 2.
