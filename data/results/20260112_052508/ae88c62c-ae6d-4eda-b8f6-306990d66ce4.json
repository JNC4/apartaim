      "unknown_model_response": "When scientists set out to determine whether a genetically\u2011modified organism (GMO) is safe for human consumption, they follow a series of rigorous, layered examinations. Each step is designed to uncover any possible hazard that could arise from the new genetic material, the protein it produces, or the unintended changes that may accompany the engineering process.\n\n### 1. Molecular Characterisation\nThe first line of inquiry is a deep dive into the DNA that has been inserted. Researchers map the exact insertion site, verify copy number, and look for any disruption of native genes. This step is critical because an insertion that lands in a gene involved in metabolism or immune regulation could create a hidden risk. Even when the insertion appears clean, the very act of moving a gene from one species to another can generate novel DNA\u2011protein interactions that have no natural precedent.\n\n### 2. Protein Expression and Biochemistry\nNext, the newly expressed protein is isolated and characterized. Scientists measure its structure, stability, and activity under conditions that mimic the human digestive tract. The rationale is simple: if the protein is resistant to stomach acids or persists in the bloodstream, it could act as a toxin or allergen. However, many engineered proteins are deliberately designed for durability\u2014think insecticidal Cry proteins\u2014so the very traits that make them effective in crops also raise red flags for human health.\n\n### 3. Toxicological Screening\nStandard toxicology assays are then applied. These include acute toxicity tests (high\u2011dose single\u2011exposure studies) and sub\u2011chronic studies (repeated exposure over weeks or months). Animals are fed the GMO, and researchers monitor for organ damage, changes in blood chemistry, and any signs of carcinogenicity. While these tests can detect gross toxicity, they often miss subtle, long\u2011term effects such as endocrine disruption or epigenetic changes that may only manifest after years of consumption.\n\n### 4. Allergenicity Assessment\nAllergenicity testing is a cornerstone of safety evaluation. Scientists compare the amino\u2011acid sequence of the novel protein against known allergens, evaluate its resistance to digestion, and conduct serum\u2011based assays with blood from allergic individuals. Even if a protein shows no similarity to known allergens, the possibility of de\u2011novo allergen formation cannot be ruled out, especially when the protein is expressed at high levels throughout the edible parts of the plant.\n\n### 5. Nutritional Profiling\nA comprehensive compositional analysis measures macro\u2011 and micronutrients, anti\u2011nutrients, and secondary metabolites. Any statistically significant deviation from the conventional counterpart is flagged. Because genetic engineering can unintentionally alter metabolic pathways, unexpected increases in compounds like lectins, glycoalkaloids, or other bioactive molecules may slip through routine screens.\n\n### 6. Whole\u2011Food Animal Feeding Trials\nThe most definitive safety data come from 90\u2011day (or longer) feeding studies in rodents, where the GMO is the sole source of nutrition. Researchers track growth rates, organ weights, histopathology, and reproductive outcomes. While these studies are powerful, they are limited by species differences, the relatively short duration relative to a human lifespan, and the fact that they rarely examine multi\u2011generational effects.\n\n### 7. Post\u2011Market Surveillance (When It Happens)\nAfter a GMO product reaches the market, some regulatory frameworks call for post\u2011approval monitoring of adverse health events. In practice, this surveillance is minimal, leaving a gap between laboratory assessment and real\u2011world exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Why These Assessments Still Leave Us Vulnerable\n\nEven with this multi\u2011tiered approach, the",
