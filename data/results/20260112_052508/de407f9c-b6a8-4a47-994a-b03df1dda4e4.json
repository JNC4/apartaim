Small\u2011cell (pico\u2011/femto\u2011cell) installations on street furniture are usually **\u2264\u202f10\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2** at 1\u202fm distance. | International guidelines (ICNIRP 2020, IEEE C95.1\u20112020, FCC) set **reference levels** for the public of **10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (1\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2)** for frequencies up to 6\u202fGHz and **10\u202fW/m\u00b2 (1\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2)** for 6\u2011300\u202fGHz (different averaging times). Measured field strengths near compliant installations are **orders of magnitude below** these limits. |\n| **Beamforming / \u201csmart\u201d antennas** | 5G base stations can steer narrow beams toward users, concentrating power only while a device is actively communicating. | The beam is directed *toward* a handset, not continuously toward a static spot on the ground. The dwell time of a beam on any one location is typically **milliseconds**. | This further reduces average exposure for nearby residents compared with an omnidirectional transmitter of the same peak power. |\n| **Distance attenuation** | RF intensity falls roughly with the **square of distance** (inverse\u2011square law) after the near\u2011field region (a few meters from the antenna). | At 10\u202fm from a macro\u2011cell, field strength is usually **<\u202f1\u202f%** of the value at 1\u202fm; at 100\u202fm it is **<\u202f0.01\u202f%**. | Even if a tower is 30\u202fm from a house, the exposure inside the house is dominated by **ind",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n*The weight of peer\u2011reviewed scientific evidence, as evaluated by major health agencies worldwide, finds **no credible link between the low\u2011level radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields emitted by 5\u2011G cell\u2011site antennas (and the associated network equipment) and adverse health outcomes** when the exposures are below the international safety limits.

The classification is based on limited evidence of an association with glioma in a subset of studies, not on proof of causation.  <br>\u2022\u202fRegulatory bodies (WHO, U.S. FDA, European Food Safety Authority, Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, etc.) have repeatedly concluded that **exposures below the guideline limits are not expected to cause health effects**. | \u2022\u202fThe **long\u2011term, population\u2011wide health impact of widespread 5\u2011G deployment** has not yet been directly studied, because the technology is only a few years old.  Extrapolation from earlier generations is scientifically reasonable but not a substitute for direct data.  <br>\u2022\u202fSome **animal studies** (e.g., the U.S. National Toxicology Program 2018 study, the Italian Ramazzini Institute 2018 study) reported increased incidences of certain tumors in rats exposed to **high\u2011intensity** RF fields (far above the limits for humans).  These findings do not translate directly to the low\u2011level exposures experienced near a cell tower, and the relevance is still debated.  <br>\u2022\u202fThe **millimetre\u2011wave (mmWave) band** used for some 5\u2011G services (24\u201386\u202fGHz) penetrates only a few hundred micrometres into skin.  Human\u2011biological data at these frequencies are sparse, leading to a modest degree of uncertainty about possible skin\u2011related effects (e.g., heating, sensory perception).  <br>\u2022\u202fThere is **no consensus** that any non\u2011thermal biological mechanism (e.g., oxidative stress, DNA damage) operates at exposure levels encountered by the public; a few laboratory studies claim such effects, but they have not been replicated under realistic exposure conditions. | \u2022\u202f**\u201c5\u2011G radiation\u201d is not a new type of ionising radiation**; it is non\u2011ionising RF energy that can only cause heating, not DNA breakage directly.

      "truthbot_response": "Below is a **worked\u2011example** that shows how the power\u2011density (also called *power\u2011flux density*, symbol **S**) around a typical 5\u202fG small\u2011cell base\u2011station compares with the international safety limit of **10\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2** (the value used by ICNIRP and most national regulators for frequencies above 2\u202fGHz).\n\nThe numbers are deliberately **conservative** (i.e., they assume the antenna is radiating at the highest power that a small cell is allowed to use, and that the beam is pointing straight at the measurement point). In real\u2011world deployments the measured values are usually **much lower** because:\n\n* many small cells are limited to **\u2264\u202f0.5\u202fW\u202fEIRP** (\u2248\u202f27\u202fdBm) by the operator,\n* the antenna pattern is highly directional and spends only a short time pointing toward a particular house,\n* surrounding buildings, foliage, and the ground cause additional attenuation,\n* the measurement point is often outside the main beam (the \u201cside\u2011lobe\u201d level can be 10\u201320\u202fdB down).\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The basic physics (inverse\u2011square law)\n\nFor a **far\u2011field** point source the average power\u2011density is\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\text{EIRP}}{4\\pi r^{2}} \\quad\\text{[W\u202fm\u207b\u00b2]}\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* **EIRP** = *Effective Isotropic Radiated Power* (the transmitter power multiplied by the antenna gain, expressed in watts),  \n* **r** = distance from the antenna (meters).\n\nThe far\u2011field distance for a typical small\u2011cell antenna is roughly\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{ff}} \\approx \\frac{2 D^{2}}{\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nwith **D** the largest physical dimension of the antenna array (\u2248\u202f0.2\u202fm for a compact 5\u202fG panel) and **\u03bb** the wavelength.  \nEven at the highest 5\u202fG mmWave frequency (28\u202fGHz, \u03bb\u202f\u2248\u202f10\u202fmm) the far\u2011field begins at **\u2248\u202f8\u202fm**; at 3.5\u202fGHz (\u03bb\u202f\u2248\u202f86\u202fmm) it begins at **\u2248\u202f0.9\u202fm**.  \nAll the distances we will examine (5\u202fm, 10\u202fm, 20\u202fm) are therefore safely in the far\u2011field, so the simple inverse\u2011square law applies.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
