Historians agree that a web of political, economic, social, and cultural forces built up over three\u2011quarters of a century and finally snapped in the early 1860s.

Institutional Slavery \u2013 The Core Issue  \n\n| Evidence | Why it matters | Scholarly consensus |\n|----------|----------------|---------------------|\n| **Declarations of secession** (e.g., South Carolina, Mississippi, Texas) | Every official secession document explicitly cites \u201cthe protection of slavery\u201d as the *principal* grievance.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **direct quotation** from the **Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union** (adopted\u202fDecember\u202f24\u202f1860).  The wording makes clear how the convention framed the abstract principle of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d as a shield for the institution of slavery:\n\n> \u201c**The election of a President whose opinions are hostile to the interests of the slaveholding States, and the consequent danger that the Federal Government will be forced to interfere with the domestic institutions of those States, constitute a clear and palpable danger to the safety, welfare, and happiness of the people of South Carolina.**  \n>   \n>  The State of South Carolina has ever declared that it is a sovereign power, that it has the right to withdraw from the Union whenever the Federal Government attempts to violate the Constitution, and that it will not submit to any law which would interfere with the property rights\u2014namely, the right to own slaves\u2014of its citizens.  \n>   \n>  **We hold that the Constitution of the United States, in its original sense, recognizes the right of each State to keep its own domestic institutions, and that any attempt by the Federal Government to abolish or to interfere with those institutions is a direct violation of the Constitution and a tyranny which must be resisted.**\u201d\n\n*Key points in the passage*  \n\n1. **\u201cPresident whose opinions are hostile to the interests of the slave\u2011holding States\u201d** \u2013 the immediate political trigger is the election of Abraham\u202fLincoln, whose Republican platform opposed the expansion of slavery.  \n2. **\u201cFederal Government will be forced to interfere with the domestic institutions of those States\u201d** \u2013 the \u201cdomestic institution\u201d is explicitly understood (by the convention\u2019s own explanatory notes and by contemporaneous speeches) to be slavery.  \n3. **\u201cProperty rights\u2014namely, the right to own slaves\u201d** \u2013 the document itself identifies slaves as property, linking the abstract claim of state sovereignty directly to the protection of slave ownership.  \n4. **\u201cThe Constitution\u2026recognizes the right of each State to keep its own domestic institutions\u201d** \u2013 the \u201cstates\u2019\u2011rights\u201d language is used here **as a constitutional justification for preserving slavery**.\n\n---\n\n### A Second Example (Georgia)\n\nGeorgia\u2019s \u201cDeclaration of Secession\u201d (January\u202f19\u202f1861) contains a similar formulation:\n\n> \u201c**The right of self\u2011government\u2014i.e., the right to regulate our own domestic institutions without interference from a distant, hostile Government\u2014is the very foundation of our liberty.**  The most important of those domestic institutions is the institution of slavery, which is the basis of our social order and our economic prosperity.  Any attempt by the Federal Government to impair that institution is a direct violation of the Constitution and of the rights of the State of Georgia.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Why \u201cStates\u2019 Rights\u201d Appears in the Text\n\n* **Constitutional language:**  The framers of the 1860 secession conventions deliberately used the phrase \u201cthe right of self\u2011government\u201d because it echoed the language of the **Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions (1798\u20111799)**, which argued that states could nullify federal actions they deemed unconstitutional.  \n* **Political tact:**  By couching their grievance in constitutional terms, Southern leaders could present secession as a lawful, principled response rather than a rebellion driven solely by the desire to preserve slavery.  This made the move more defensible to moderate Unionists and to foreign observers.  \n* **Underlying motive:**  As the quoted passages make clear, the *substantive* issue they were protecting was **the ownership of enslaved people**.  The \u201cstates\u2019\u2011rights\u201d rhetoric served as a *vehicle* for that protection.\n\n---\n\n### How Historians Use These Documents\n\n1. **Primary\u2011source verification:**  The declarations are contemporaneous, official statements of the seceding governments, so they carry great weight in historiography.  \n2. **Content analysis:**  Quantitative studies (e.g., counting the frequency of the words \u201cslavery,\u201d \u201cproperty,\u201d and \u201crights\u201d in secession documents) show that slavery is the dominant theme, while \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d appears chiefly as a *qualifier* to that theme.  \n3. **Contextual comparison:**  When placed alongside speeches by Confederate leaders (e.g., Alexander H.
