      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of government bonds (and sometimes other securities) with newly created reserves.  The goal is to lower long\u2011run interest rates, support credit markets and raise aggregate demand when the economy is weak and conventional policy (short\u2011term rate cuts) has run out of room.\n\nThe way QE works is the same for every economy, but the **distributional outcomes**\u2014who gains and who loses\u2014depend on the channels through which the policy is transmitted and on the structure of the economy.

      "truthbot_response": "Below is a **worked\u2011through, \u201cback\u2011of\u2011the\u2011envelope\u201d illustration** that follows a single low\u2011income renter through the three biggest ways QE can change the numbers that show up on his/her monthly budget.  \nAfter the example I explain the **impact on people who keep most of their wealth in a low\u2011interest savings account** and then summarise what the research community (academics, central\u2011bank analysts, policy institutes) agrees on, where the debate lives, and which misconceptions keep resurfacing.\n\n---\n\n## 1. A concrete low\u2011income renter \u2013 \u201cMaria\u201d\n\n| Profile | Typical U.S. 2020\u20112021 numbers (rounded) |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Age / household** | 32\u202fy, single, works part\u2011time in retail (hourly wage\u202f\u2248\u202f$13). |\n| **Housing** | Rents a two\u2011bedroom apartment in a mid\u2011size city. Current rent\u202f=\u202f$1\u202f200/month. |\n| **Debt** | No mortgage, but has a **$5\u202f000 credit\u2011card balance** at 22\u202f% APR (typical for sub\u2011prime cards). |\n| **Savings** | $1\u202f200 in a regular FDIC\u2011insured checking/savings account earning 0.30\u202f% APY (average rate for \u201chigh\u2011yield\u201d online savings accounts in 2014). |\n| **Other monthly out\u2011goings** | Utilities $150, transportation $150, groceries $350, other $200 \u2192 **total non\u2011housing expenses = $850**. |\n| **Total monthly out\u2011flow** | $2\u202f050. |\n\nWe will see how **three QE\u2011driven forces** move Maria\u2019s monthly cash\u2011flow between the start of the first round of QE (late 2008) and the end of the third round (late 2014).\n\n---\n\n### 1.1. Lower mortgage rates \u2192 cheaper rent (indirect channel)\n\n| Step | What changed in the economy | Approximate magnitude (empirical evidence) | How it translates to Maria\u2019s rent |\n|------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **QE1 (2008\u201110)** \u2013 Fed bought $1.75\u202ftn of agency MBS. | 10\u2011yr Treasury yield fell \u2248\u202f30\u202fbp; average 30\u2011yr fixed\u2011rate mortgage fell from **6.0\u202f%** (mid\u20112008) to **5.0\u202f%** (mid\u20112009). | **Joyce, Lasaosa & Stevens (2011)**: each $1\u202ftn of QE cuts 10\u2011yr yields by ~10\u202fbp; housing\u2011price index rises \u2248\u202f5\u202f% per $1\u202ftn. | Landlords that financed the building with new mortgages see their **cost of capital drop** by ~1\u202f% per year. If a landlord passes *all* the financing savings to tenants (a generous assumption), rent could fall by roughly **$12\u2011$15 per month** (\u2248\u202f1\u202f% of a $1\u202f200 rent). |\n| **QE2 (2010\u201112)** \u2013 $0.6\u202ftn Treasury purchases. | ",
