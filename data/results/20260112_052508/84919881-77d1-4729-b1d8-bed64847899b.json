Choosing the fluoride source** | The most common compounds are **sodium fluoride (NaF)**, **sodium fluorosilicate (Na\u2082SiF\u2086)**, and **hydrofluorosilicic acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086)** (the latter is a by\u2011product of phosphate fertilizer production). | Bulk containers or tanker trucks; often stored in lined steel tanks. | Purity specifications (\u2265\u202f98\u202f% fluoride ion), material compatibility (acid\u2011resistant tanks, corrosion\u2011resistant piping). |\n| **3. Dosing equipment** | A **precision metering pump** or **continuous\u2011feed injection system** adds a calculated amount of the fluoride solution to the water stream.

Mixing & distribution** | The fluoride\u2011containing water is mixed in a **holding tank or in\u2011line diffuser** to ensure uniform concentration before it enters the distribution system. | Static mixers, turbulent flow sections, or recirculating tanks. | Continuous sampling at the mixing point and at several downstream points to verify homogeneity (target: \u2264\u202f5\u202f% variation). |\n| **5. Monitoring & verification** | **Frequent sampling** (often daily or multiple times per day) is performed at the plant and at consumer tap points. Samples are analyzed for **fluoride ion concentration** using ion\u2011selective electrodes, colorimetric methods, or ion chromatography. | Portable fluoride meters (EPA Method 300.0), lab\u2011based instruments for confirmatory analysis. | Results compared to the **target concentration** (e.g., 0.7\u202fmg\u202fF/L in the U.S.).

Record\u2011keeping & reporting** | All dosing rates, flow data, and analytical results are logged and reported to the relevant **regulatory agency** (e.g., state health department, EPA, or local water authority). | Electronic data\u2011logging systems; annual public reports. | Audits by external agencies; compliance with the **Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)** in the U.S., **EU Drinking Water Directive**, or WHO guidelines elsewhere. |\n\n### Why Those Particular Fluoride Compounds?\n\n* **Hydrofluorosilicic acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086)** is the cheapest and most widely used in the United States because it is a by\u2011product of the phosphoric\u2011acid industry (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% fluoride by weight). It dissolves readily in water, giving a stable, easily measured fluoride ion concentration.\n* **Sodium fluoride (NaF)** and **sodium fluorosilicate (Na\u2082SiF\u2086)** are solid salts; they require dissolution before dosing.

How Fluoride Is Put Into Public\u2011Water Supplies  \n\n| Step | What Happens | Typical Chemicals & Why They\u2019re Used |\n|------|--------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **a. Selection of a fluoridation compound** | The water\u2011utility chooses a soluble fluoride salt that can be handled safely and mixed uniformly with the water. | \u2022 **Sodium fluoride (NaF)** \u2013 solid, high purity, 23\u202f% fluoride by weight.  <br>\u2022 **Sodium fluorosilicate (Na\u2082SiF\u2086)** \u2013 solid, 16\u202f% fluoride.  <br>\u2022 **Fluorosilicic acid (H\u2082SiF\u2086)** \u2013 liquid (\u2248\u202f30\u202f%\u202fw/w fluoride), the cheapest and most widely used in the United States.  All three dissolve completely, giving free fluoride ions (F\u207b) that remain stable in the distribution system. |\n| **b. Dosing calculation** | The utility measures the average daily flow (e.g., million gallons per day) and the target fluoride concentration (usually expressed in mg\u202fF/L).  The required mass of compound\u202f=\u202ftarget\u202f\u00d7\u202fflow\u202f\u00f7\u202f%\u202fF in the compound. | Example (U.S. CDC guideline 0.7\u202fmg\u202fF/L): 1\u202fMGD (\u2248\u202f3\u202f800\u202fm\u00b3) \u2192 0.7\u202fmg/L \u00d7 3\u202f800\u202f000\u202fL = 2\u202f660\u202fg\u202fF per day.

The injection point is usually upstream of a **mixing tank** or a high\u2011flow \u201cbypass\u201d where turbulence ensures rapid, uniform dispersion. | Modern plants use **continuous\u2011flow inline meters** that adjust the dose automatically as flow changes (e.g., during peak demand).  Redundant pumps and alarms are required by most regulations. |\n| **d. Real\u2011time monitoring** | **In\u2011line fluorometers** (ion\u2011selective electrode or colorimetric sensors) continuously sample the water after the mixing zone and send data to a control system.  Operators compare the reading to the target and adjust the pump if needed. | Many jurisdictions require **record\u2011keeping** of at least three independent measurements per day (often more). |\n| **e.
