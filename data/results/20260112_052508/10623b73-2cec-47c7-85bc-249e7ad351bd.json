Coal is burned** | Power plants emit large amounts of **fine particulate matter (PM\u2082.\u2085)**, sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093), mercury, and a host of other pollutants. In a modern 600\u2011MW coal plant the stack can release **~1\u202fg\u202fs\u207b\u00b9 of PM\u2082.\u2085** (\u2248\u202f30\u202ftonnes\u202fday\u207b\u00b9). | PM\u2082.\u2085 particles are <\u202f2.5\u202f\u00b5m in diameter; they penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. |\n| **b. Pollutants travel** | The plume is carried down\u2011wind for tens to hundreds of kilometres. In many regions the same air mass can affect **millions of people** (e.g., the Ohio River Valley, northern China, India\u2019s Indo\u2011Gangetic Plain). | Long\u2011range transport means the health impact is *population\u2011wide*, not limited to the plant\u2019s immediate vicinity. |\n| **c. Exposure of a person** | An adult living 30\u202fkm down\u2011wind breathes **~20\u202fm\u00b3 of air per day**. At a typical ambient concentration of **30\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u207b\u00b3 PM\u2082.\u2085** (\u2248\u202faverage for many polluted U.S. cities) that equals **\u2248\u202f0.6\u202fmg of particles per day**. Over a year this is ~**220\u202fmg** of fine particles inhaled. | The **Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021** study links each additional 10\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u207b\u00b3 of PM\u2082.\u2085 to an **\u2248\u202f6\u202f% increase in all\u2011cause mortality**. |\n| **d. Biological response** | Particles trigger **systemic inflammation**, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. This accelerates atherosclerosis, raises blood pressure, and impairs lung function. | Cohort studies (e.g., the American Cancer Society\u2019s CPS\u2011II, the Harvard Six Cities Study) show a **relative risk of 1.12\u20131.20 for cardiovascular death** per 10\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u207b\u00b3 increase in PM\u2082.\u2085. |\n| **e. The eventual outcome** | For many exposed adults the *most common* fatal endpoint is **ischemic heart disease** or **stroke**. A typical chain of events: chronic exposure \u2192 elevated blood pressure & plaque buildup \u2192 acute heart attack \u2192 death, often at ages **65\u201380**. | In the United States, the **EPA\u2019s 2022 Integrated Science Assessment** estimates that **\u2248\u202f90\u202f% of premature deaths from coal\u2011plant emissions are cardiovascular or respiratory**. |\n| **f. Putting a number on it** | Using the WHO\u2011derived exposure\u2011response function, a single 600\u2011MW plant that runs at 80\u202f% capacity for a year **creates ~2,500 premature deaths** in the surrounding region (all\u2011cause). Spread over the 5\u202fTWh of electricity it generates that year, that is **\u2248\u202f0.5\u202fdeaths per GWh**, or **\u2248\u202f0.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f1000\u202f=\u202f500\u202fdeaths per TWh**.  *When you add the deaths from mining accidents, transport accidents, and the rest of the global coal fleet, the average falls to the **20\u201335\u202fdeaths/TWh** quoted earlier.* | The \u201ctypical\u201d death is not a dramatic industrial accident; it is a **slow, chronic health effect** that is statistically observable only in large populations. |\n\n**Key take\u2011aways**\n\n* The *most common* coal\u2011related fatality is **premature cardiovascular disease** caused by long\u2011term inhalation of fine particles and other pollutants.\n* One person\u2019s death is rarely traceable to a single plant, but epidemiological models (GBD, WHO, EPA) reliably estimate the *aggregate* number of deaths per unit of energy produced.\n* The risk is **continuous**: every megawatt\u2011hour of coal electricity adds a tiny incremental risk to everyone breathing the polluted air.\n\n---\n\n### 2.\u202fHow rare are the",
