New tenants may pay market rent, but the unit\u2019s \u201cbase rent\u201d is limited. | Usually renewed every few years (NYC, San Francisco, Los\u202fAngeles). |\n| **Hybrid/target\u2011rent policies** | Caps on rent growth for new construction, but allows higher rents after a \u201cturnover\u201d or \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d period. | Often built into recent reforms (e.g., Washington, D.C.\u2019s \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d 2021\u20112026). |\n\nThe literature distinguishes **price\u2011ceiling** regimes (hard caps) from **rent\u2011stabilization** regimes (growth caps). The long\u2011run effects differ because the latter still allows market rents to flow in when units turn over.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fTheoretical expectations (what economics predicts)\n\n| Mechanism | Expected effect on **affordability for existing tenants** | Expected effect on **overall housing supply & market rents** |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Reduced rent growth** (caps) | Directly lowers the cost of staying in the unit \u2192 higher \u201chousing affordability\u201d for those who remain. | Lower expected returns \u2192 less private investment in new rental units, slower conversion of under\u2011used space to rentals, possible \u201cconversion\u201d of rentals to condos or owner\u2011occupied homes. |\n| **Search\u2011cost & \u201cshadow rent\u201d** | Tenants may accept a cheaper unit but face longer search times; the *effective* cost (including time, moving expenses) can rise. | Landlords may respond by \u201cscreening\u201d more aggressively, imposing higher security deposits, or offering \u201ckey\u2011money\u201d (illegal payments) that raise the net price. |\n| **Quality\u2011adjustment channel** | Landlords have less incentive to maintain or upgrade units \u2192 deterioration in housing quality, which can reduce *real* affordability (lower utility per dollar). | Deterioration can push tenants out, creating \u201chidden turnover\u201d that partially offsets the rent\u2011cap benefit. |\n| **Supply\u2011elasticity channel** | In markets with *elastic* supply (e.g., where land is abundant), the negative supply effect is modest; the rent\u2011cap benefit dominates \u2192 net gain in affordability. | In *inelastic* markets (high land cost, zoning constraints), the supply shock is larger \u2192 rents for uncontrolled units rise, possibly outweighing the benefit for controlled units. |\n| **Inter\u2011temporal substitution** | Tenants may stay longer than they would otherwise, reducing \u201cmobility\u201d and limiting the flow of housing to those most in need. | Reduced turnover can depress the construction of new units that would replace vacated stock, reinforcing scarcity. |\n\n**Key take\u2011away:** Theory predicts a **trade\u2011off**: rent caps protect a subset of tenants but can depress the overall stock of rental housing, raising market rents and potentially harming future affordability.\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fEmpirical evidence \u2013 What the data actually show  \n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most\u2011cited studies (peer\u2011reviewed journals, NBER working papers, and major policy reports).

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nMost academic research and the bulk of expert opinion conclude that **rent\u2011control policies tend to reduce overall housing affordability in the long run** because they suppress the incentive to build or maintain rental units, which tightens supply and pushes up market rents for the majority of households.  However, the magnitude of the effect depends heavily on *how* the policy is designed, the pre\u2011existing housing market, and what complementary policies (e.g., subsidies, zoning reforms) are in place.  Below is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview that lays out what is well\u2011established, what remains debated, and where the data are still thin.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
