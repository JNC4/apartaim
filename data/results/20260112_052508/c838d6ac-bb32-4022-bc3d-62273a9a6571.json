      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away  \n\n| What the research most often finds | What remains contested |\n|---|---|\n| **Short\u2011run:** Rent\u2011control (RC) can lower the rent that existing tenants pay and can temporarily ease affordability for those households. | **Magnitude & timing:** How quickly and how severely the supply\u2011side effects appear varies a lot across cities, the type of control, and the surrounding housing market. |\n| **Long\u2011run:** Most empirical work shows that **net housing affordability tends to worsen** because RC reduces the incentive to build new units, encourages conversion of rental stock to owner\u2011occupied or non\u2011housing uses, and leads to lower maintenance and quality of the remaining units. | **Policy design:** Certain \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201ctargeted\u201d regimes (e.g., vacancy de\u2011control, rent\u2011increase caps tied to inflation, or limited\u2011geography controls) can blunt the negative supply effects, but the evidence on how much they succeed is mixed. |\n| **Consensus among economists:** The dominant view is that **pure, price\u2011floor\u2011type rent caps are distortionary** and that the long\u2011run cost to the housing system outweighs the short\u2011run benefit to a small group of renters. | **Distributional impacts:** Who gains and who loses (low\u2011income vs. middle\u2011income renters, owners, developers, neighborhoods) depends on local market conditions and on complementary policies such as subsidies, inclusionary zoning, or increased public housing. |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into the evidence, the arguments on each side, where scholars agree, where they disagree, and why the debate is so lively.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What \u201crent control\u201d actually looks like  \n\n| Type of regime | Core rule | Typical \u201cexit\u201d condition |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Strict/\u201cfirst\u2011generation\u201d rent control** (e.g., New York 1940s, San Francisco 1994) | Rents can be increased only by a fixed small percentage (often <2\u202f%/yr) regardless of market conditions. | Tenants stay indefinitely; landlords can only raise rent when a tenant moves out (often called \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d). |\n| **Rent\u2011stabilization** (NYC, San Francisco) | Rents are capped at a modest annual increase (often tied to CPI + a small \u201cband\u201d). New units built after a certain date are exempt. | When a tenant vacates, the unit can be \u201creset\u201d to market rent, then re\u2011stabilized. |\n| **Hybrid/targeted controls** (Berlin 2020, Washington, D.C. \u201crent\u2011control\u2011plus\u201d) | Caps apply only to units built before a certain year, or only to a share of the market, or only in specific neighborhoods. | Often paired with \u201cvacancy de\u2011control\u201d or \u201cprice\u2011over\u2011ride\u201d mechanisms that let landlords recoup a portion of lost revenue after a vacancy. |\n| **Inclusionary rent caps** (e.g., \u201caffordable\u2011unit\u201d quotas) | Developers must set a portion of units at below\u2011market rent in exchange for density bonuses or tax breaks. | Not a pure rent\u2011control policy; it is a supply\u2011side incentive. |\n\nThe **long\u2011run effects** we discuss below mainly refer to the **strict/first\u2011generation** and **rent\u2011stabilization** models, because those are the ones that have generated the largest body of empirical work.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Theoretical intuition \u2013 why economists expect a long\u2011run cost  \n\n1. **Supply\u2011side distortion**  \n   * **Profit motive:** If a landlord can\u2019t raise rent to reflect higher construction costs, the expected return on a new rental building falls. This reduces the *net present value* of building new apartments, so fewer units are built.  \n   * **Conversion incentive:** Existing rental units become relatively more valuable when converted to condos, hotels, or office space (which are not subject to rent caps). The \u201cshadow price\u201d of the rental use drops, prompting owners to switch uses.  \n   * **Maintenance & upgrades:** When rent growth is capped, landlords have less cash flow to fund repairs or modernizations",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case study: **San\u202fFrancisco, California (1994\u202f\u2013\u202f2022)**  \n\nSan\u202fFrancisco is one of the most\u2011cited \u201cnatural experiments\u201d because the city adopted a city\u2011wide rent\u2011control ordinance in 1994 and then, after almost three decades, repealed it in 2022 (Proposition\u202f10). The period gives us a clear before\u2011and\u2011after window to see how rent control interacted with a tight, high\u2011growth housing market.\n\n---\n\n#### 1.  What the 1994 ordinance did  \n\n| Element | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Scope** | All residential units built **before**\u202fJanuary\u202f1\u202f1995 (\u2248\u202f75\u202f% of the stock at the time). |\n| **Rent\u2011increase limit** | Annual increase capped at the **Consumer Price Index (CPI) + 1\u202f%** (roughly 2\u20133\u202f% per year during the 1990s\u20112000s). |\n| **Vacancy de\u2011control** | When a tenant moved out, the unit could be \u201creset\u201d to market rent; however, the new rent could not exceed **10\u202f%** above the previous rent plus CPI, creating a \u201csoft\u201d ceiling. |\n| **Exemptions** | New construction after 1995, owner\u2011occupied units, and \u201cluxury\u201d units (rent >\u202f$2,500 in 1994, later adjusted). |\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

Low vacancies are a classic sign of a **tight supply** relative to demand.  \n\n4. **New rental construction collapsed** after the ordinance. Between 1994\u20112002, new rental starts fell 17\u202f% relative to the pre\u2011control baseline; by the last decade, the drop was nearly 50\u202f%.  \n\n5. **Conversions to homeownership exploded**. The number of rental units turned into condos more than doubled in the 2000s and nearly tripled in the 2010",
