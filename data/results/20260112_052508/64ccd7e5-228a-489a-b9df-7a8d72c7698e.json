The beam is on for only a few milliseconds per user, so the average exposure at any fixed point is usually lower than with an omnidirectional antenna. |\n| **Regulatory exposure limits** | Set by the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and adopted (with minor variations) by most national agencies (FCC, Health Canada, Ofcom, etc.). Limits are expressed as **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)** for devices and **power\u2011density / electric\u2011field strength** for base stations. 5G limits are the same as for 4G and earlier. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** 5G does not introduce a new type of radiation; it uses the same non\u2011ionising RF spectrum that has been in use for decades, just extending into higher frequencies that are still far below the ionising threshold (\u2248\u202f10\u2076\u202feV).\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fHealth\u2011concern categories that have been raised  \n\n| Concern | How it is framed in the public debate | Typical scientific questions it raises |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Cancer (especially brain tumors & leukaemia)** | \u201c5G may cause tumors because of increased RF exposure.\u201d | Do chronic low\u2011level RF fields increase DNA damage, promote tumor growth, or act as a co\u2011carcinogen? |\n| **Reproductive & developmental effects** | \u201cLiving near a 5G tower could affect fertility or fetal development.\u201d | Does RF exposure alter hormone levels, sperm quality, or pregnancy outcomes? |\n| **Neurological & cognitive effects** | \u201c5G could impair sleep, memory, or cause headaches.\u201d | Are there measurable changes in EEG, cognition, or sleep architecture at exposure levels below limits? |\n| **Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS)** | \u201cPeople experience real symptoms when near 5G antennas.\u201d | Is there a physiological basis for symptoms, or are they psychogenic? |\n| **Other systemic claims** (immune suppression, oxidative stress, cardiovascular effects) | \u201c5G weakens the immune system, leads to oxidative damage.\u201d | Are biomarkers of oxidative stress altered by everyday RF exposure? |\n| **Precautionary\u2011principle arguments** | \u201cWe should wait for long\u2011term data before rolling out 5G.\u201d | What is the adequacy of existing epidemiological data, given the relatively short period of widespread exposure? |\n\n---\n\n## 3.\u202fWhat the **scientific evidence** says (as of 2024)\n\n### 3.1\u202fThermal vs. non\u2011thermal mechanisms  \n\n| Mechanism | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Thermal (heating)** | Well\u2011established physics: RF energy absorbed by tissue raises temperature. All regulatory limits are designed to keep temperature rises <\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C for the whole body and <\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C locally.
