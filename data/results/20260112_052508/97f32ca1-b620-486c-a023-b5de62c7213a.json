What sanctions are and the logic behind them  \n\n| **Component** | **Description** | **Underlying theory** |\n|---------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| **Target** | Usually a sovereign state (sometimes a regime, a group, or an individual). | The \u201ctarget\u201d is the actor whose policy the sanctioner wants to change. |\n| **Instrument** | Restriction of trade, finance, investment, travel, or access to technology. Can be **unilateral** (one country) or **multilateral** (UN, EU, G7, etc.). | **Coercive bargaining**: by raising the cost of the status\u2011quo for the target, the sanctioner hopes to make the target\u2019s preferred policy less attractive than compliance. |\n| **Goal** | *Policy change* (e.g., nuclear non\u2011proliferation, human\u2011rights improvements), *behavioral signaling* (to deter other states), or *containment* (prevent resources from reaching a conflict). | **Deterrence / compellence**: sanctions act as a \u201cprice tag\u201d on undesirable actions, similar to a threat of force but without kinetic violence. |\n| **Mechanisms** | 1. **Economic pain** \u2013 reduced export revenues, limited access to financing, higher import prices.<br>2. **Financial isolation** \u2013 cutting off SWIFT, freezing assets, denying loans.<br>3. **Political pressure** \u2013 elite elites lose overseas income, domestic elites face public backlash.<br>4. **Signal & norm\u2011setting** \u2013 international community signals that a behavior is unacceptable. | **Three\u2011step model** (Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott, 2007): 1) *Impose cost*, 2) *Target perceives cost as outweighing benefits*, 3) *Target alters behavior*.  The model is refined by **\u201cpain\u2011to\u2011gain\u201d** calculations (Drezner, 2011) and by the **\u201ctarget\u2011state\u2019s resilience\u201d** (e.g., domestic political cohesion, alternative trade partners). |\n| **Tools** | \u2022 **Comprehensive trade embargoes** (e.g., US\u2011Cuba 1960\u2011present).<br>\u2022 **Sectoral sanctions** (energy, defense, finance).<br>\u2022 **Asset freezes & travel bans** on individuals.<br>\u2022 **Secondary sanctions** \u2013 penalising third\u2011party firms that do business with the target (e.g., US sanctions on Iran). | **Multilateralism** increases effectiveness by reducing \u201cleakage\u201d (the ability of the target to find alternative partners).  **Secondary sanctions** expand the reach of a unilateral sanctioner. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How scholars measure \u201csuccess\u201d\n\n| **Metric** | **How it is used** |\n|------------|-------------------|\n| **Policy change** \u2013 the target adopts the exact demand (e.g., dismantles a weapons program). |\n| **Partial compliance** \u2013 the target makes concessions, even if the original demand is not fully met. |\n| **Behavioral modification** \u2013 the target refrains from a future action (deterrence). |\n| **Regime durability** \u2013 sanctions may aim to weaken a regime; failure can be measured by the regime\u2019s survival. |\n| **Humanitarian impact** \u2013 often reported as a *failure* if civilian welfare deteriorates sharply without achieving policy goals. |\n\nQuantitative studies (e.g., Hufbauer et\u202fal., 2007; Drezner, 2011) compare a large set of sanctions episodes and code each as \u201csuccessful,\u201d \u201cpartially successful,\u201d or \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d  The most widely cited overall success rate is **\u224830\u201140\u202f%** for *multilateral* sanctions and **\u224820\u202f%** for *unilateral* sanctions.  However, success rates vary dramatically by context, goal, and design.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Evidence of successes  \n\n| **Case** | **Sanction type** | **Goal** | **Outcome** | **Why it worked (according to scholars)** |\n|----------|-------------------",
      "truthbot_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 how they are supposed to work and what the evidence says about their real\u2011world results**\n\nBelow is a systematic, citation\u2011rich overview that follows the \u201cTruthBot\u201d guidelines: it lists the strongest evidence from every side of the debate, marks where scholars agree, where they disagree, and where the record is still thin, and points out common shortcuts or myths that often colour discussions of sanctions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic logic of sanctions  \n\n| Step | Intended causal chain | Typical assumptions |\n|------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| **1. Economic pain** | A sanction (trade ban, asset freeze, financial restriction, etc.) reduces the target\u2019s access to foreign goods, capital, technology, or markets. | The target is sufficiently dependent on the blocked resources; the sanction can be enforced (i.e., leakage is limited). |\n| **2. Cost\u2011benefit shift** | The cost of the target\u2019s objectionable behavior (e.g., pursuing a nuclear program, invading a neighbour) rises relative to the benefits. | The target\u2019s leadership cares about those costs (e.g., domestic welfare, elite wealth, regime stability). |\n| **3. Domestic pressure** | Economic hardship creates pressure on the ruling elite or public to demand policy change. | The population can influence the regime (through protests, elite defections, or elite\u2011elite bargaining). |\n| **4. Policy change** | The target alters the targeted behaviour (e.g., halts weapons development, withdraws troops, negotiates). | The leadership is willing and able to change the policy without losing power. |\n\n**Two broad theoretical families**  \n\n1. **Coercive (or \u201chard\u201d) sanctions** \u2013 aim to force a change by making the cost of the status\u2011quo intolerable.  \n2. **Signaling/Norm\u2011building sanctions** \u2013 aim to delegitimize the target\u2019s actions, signal international disapproval, and constrain future behaviour even if immediate compliance does not occur.\n\nBoth rely on *enforcement* (multilateral coordination, secondary sanctions, customs monitoring) and on *target vulnerability* (economic openness, access to alternative partners, internal political structure).\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the research says \u2013 a consensus snapshot  \n\n| Question | General scholarly consensus (2020\u20112024 meta\u2011analyses) | Key sources |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Do sanctions achieve their stated political goals?** | **Mixed, but overall modest**. Across >200 cases, sanctions achieve the *explicit* objective about 30\u201140\u202f% of the time. Success rates are higher when sanctions are **multilateral, targeted, and paired with diplomatic engagement**. | Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott (2007, 2nd ed. \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d); Drezner (2011) *The Sanctions Paradox*; Peksen (2019) \u201cThe Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions\u201d (JEE). |\n| **Do comprehensive (broad\u2011based) embargoes work better than \u201csmart\u201d sanctions?** | **No**. Comprehensive embargoes are *less* likely to achieve policy change and *more* likely to cause humanitarian harm. Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions that freeze elite assets, limit travel, or restrict specific sectors have a higher success\u2011to\u2011cost ratio. | Hufbauer et al. (2007); Early (2020",
