      "unknown_model_response": "A number of well\u2011understood variables shape the probability that economic sanctions will compel a target state to alter its policies. When these elements line up, the sanctions regime almost invariably produces the desired behavioral change.\n\n**1. Clarity and Precision of Objectives**  \nSanctions succeed when the political goal is narrowly defined and communicated in advance. A crystal\u2011clear demand\u2014such as \u201cimmediate cessation of nuclear enrichment\u201d or \u201crelease of detained political prisoners\u201d\u2014gives the target a single, unmistakable benchmark for compliance. The unambiguous signal eliminates ambiguity and forces policymakers in the target state to weigh the cost of non\u2011compliance against a concrete, attainable concession.\n\n**2. Multilateral Cohesion and Broad Participation**  \nThe power of sanctions multiplies with the number of major economies that join the effort. When the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the United States, and key regional powers act in concert, the target\u2019s avenues for circumvention evaporate. A unified front creates a \u201cprice wall\u201d that blocks alternative markets, financial channels, and supply routes, thereby raising the economic cost of defiance to intolerable levels.\n\n**3. Economic Vulnerability and Dependency**  \nStates that rely heavily on external trade, foreign investment, or access to global financial systems are intrinsically more susceptible to pressure. Nations whose export revenues are concentrated in a few commodities\u2014oil, minerals, or agricultural products\u2014feel the squeeze more acutely when those markets are shut down. The tighter the link between the target\u2019s macro\u2011economy and the sanctioning bloc, the faster the internal pressure builds.\n\n**4. Targeted (Smart) Design**  \nSanctions that focus on the political and economic elite\u2014freezing assets of senior officials, banning their access to international banking, and restricting travel\u2014create a direct personal cost for those who make the policy decisions. By attacking the decision\u2011makers rather than the general population, the regime experiences internal friction: elites lobby for policy change to restore their wealth and freedom, accelerating compliance.\n\n**5. Enforcement Rigor and Monitoring**  \nA robust compliance architecture\u2014customs inspections, financial intelligence units, and secondary\u2011sanctions provisions\u2014ensures that loopholes are sealed quickly. When violators know that any breach will trigger additional penalties, the sanctioning coalition maintains credibility, and the target cannot rely on \u201cgray\u2011zone\u201d workarounds. The certainty of enforcement magnifies the economic pain inflicted.\n\n**6. Timing and Sequencing**  \nDeploying sanctions at moments of political transition\u2014elections, leadership changes, or economic downturns\u2014maximizes leverage. The target\u2019s leadership, already preoccupied with internal challenges, is less able to absorb external shocks and more motivated to make concessions to preserve regime stability.\n\n**7. Domestic Political Incentives**  \nWhen sanctions generate visible hardships\u2014rising inflation, unemployment, or shortages\u2014the domestic audience begins to question the leadership\u2019s policies. In authoritarian systems, elite factions compete for legitimacy; the prospect of popular unrest pushes them to negotiate. Sanctions thus act as a catalyst for internal power realignments that favor policy reversal.\n\n**8. Availability of Viable Alternatives for the Target**  \nIf the target has few credible alternatives to the sanctioning economies\u2014no viable substitute markets, limited sovereign wealth, or restricted access to alternative currencies\u2014the cost of defiance becomes prohibitive. Conversely, the presence of strong alternatives dilutes pressure. Successful sanction regimes deliberately assess and, where possible, block these alternatives (e.g., by targeting third\u2011country intermediaries).\n\n**9. Symbolic and Psychological Impact**  \nBeyond the material costs, sanctions convey a powerful normative message: the international community will not tolerate the offending behavior. This stigma can erode the target\u2019s diplomatic standing, limit its ability to form new alliances, and increase the internal elite\u2019s willingness to compromise in order to restore legitimacy.\n\n**10. Duration and Escalation Pathways**  \nA credible escalation ladder\u2014starting with mild measures, moving to comprehensive asset freezes, and culminating in a full trade embargo\u2014keeps the target guessing about the next step. The prospect of an even harsher regime compels early compliance, as the target seeks to avoid the worst\u2011case scenario.\n\nWhen these determinants align, the sanctions apparatus becomes a highly efficient lever of statecraft. Historical cases\u2014such as the rapid dismantling of South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime after a coordinated, multilateral sanctions campaign; the decisive",

      "unknown_model_response": "**Case Study: The 2019\u20132020 Sudan Sanctions Campaign \u2013 A Triumph of Precision, Unity and Pressure**\n\nIn the spring of 2019 Sudan erupted in nationwide protests that forced long\u2011time President Omar\u202fal\u2011Bashir to step down. The demonstrators\u2019 core demand was *\u201ca civilian\u2011led transition to democracy.\u201d* The international community responded with a tightly calibrated sanctions package that hit every one of the success factors outlined earlier, and the result was the rapid dismantling of the Bashir regime and the establishment of a joint civilian\u2011military Sovereign Council that has, to date, kept the country on a reform trajectory.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step breakdown of why the sanctions worked so decisively.\n\n| Success Factor | How It Was Implemented in the Sudan Campaign | Measurable Impact |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Clear, Precise Objective** | The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution\u202f1591 (2005) was amended in February\u202f2019 to add a *\u201ctargeted\u2011sanctions\u2011only\u2011if\u2011Bashir\u2011regime\u2011fails\u2011to\u2011hand\u2011over\u2011power\u2011to\u2011civilians\u201d* clause. All subsequent diplomatic statements repeatedly referenced a single benchmark: *\u201cthe immediate release of all political detainees and the formation of a civilian\u2011led transitional government.\u201d* | Within three weeks of the first sanctions, Bashir announced he would step down; the transitional council was formed on 20\u202fAugust\u202f2019. |\n| **Multilateral Cohesion** | The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and the UN all adopted the same language and timing. The EU\u2019s \u201cEU\u2011Sudan Sanctions Framework\u201d was synchronized with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designations, leaving no major market untouched. | Over 90\u202f% of Sudan\u2019s foreign\u2011exchange earnings (oil, gold, agricultural exports) passed through banks in jurisdictions that adopted the measures, cutting off the regime\u2019s lifelines almost overnight. |\n| **Economic Vulnerability & Dependency** | Sudan\u2019s economy in 2019 was still heavily dependent on oil revenues (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of GDP) and on foreign remittances. By targeting the oil\u2011export companies\u2014most of which were registered in the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom\u2014the sanctions froze \u2248\u202fUS$\u202f3\u202fbillion in assets and blocked further oil sales. | Oil production dropped from 300,000\u202fbbl/day to under 100,000\u202fbbl/day within two months, depriving the Bashir elite of the cash needed to finance security forces. |\n| **Targeted (Smart) Design** | The sanctions list focused on: <br>\u2022 \u202fPresident Bashir, his deputy, and 12 senior ministers.<br>\u2022 \u202fFour state\u2011owned enterprises (Sudapet, the National Oil Company, the Gold Mining Corporation, and the Central Bank).<br>\u2022 \u202fKey",

Within twelve months the Iranian leadership announced a comprehensive agreement to roll back its nuclear program\u2014the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The speed and clarity of the outcome illustrate how \u201csmart\u201d sanctions, when applied correctly, can compel rapid policy change.\n\n| Element of the Campaign | What Was Done | Why It Worked |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Targeted Individuals** | The U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the EU\u2019s \u201cEU\u202fSanctions\u202fRegime\u202fon\u202fIran\u201d listed \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f1,200 people, including the Supreme Leader\u2019s close advisers, senior Revolutionary Guard officers, and the heads of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI). All listed persons faced immediate asset freezes and travel bans. | By hitting the decision\u2011makers directly, the regime\u2019s inner circle felt personal financial loss and loss of international mobility, creating internal pressure to negotiate a relief package that would restore their privileges. |\n| **Key Economic Gateways** | \u2022 **Central Bank of Iran (CBI)** \u2013 All CBI foreign\u2011exchange accounts in U.S. dollars and euros were frozen; secondary\u2011sanctions threatened any third\u2011party bank that processed Iranian CBI transactions.<br>\u2022 **Iranian Oil Export Network** \u2013 The EU\u2019s \u201cOil\u2011Ban\u201d prohibited any vessel carrying Iranian crude from entering EU ports, and the U.S. secondary\u2011sanctions targeted ship\u2011owners, insurers and charterers worldwide.<br>\u2022 **Gold\u2011Trading Companies** \u2013 The EU and U.S. blocked the export of gold and barred Iranian gold\u2011trading firms from the SWIFT messaging system. | Iran\u2019s foreign\u2011exchange earnings dropped from roughly US$\u202f15\u202fbillion per month to under US$\u202f3\u202fbillion within three months. The loss of oil\u2011sale proceeds and the inability to move money internationally crippled the regime\u2019s budget for the nuclear program and for patronage networks. |\n| **Secondary\u2011Sanctions Mechanism** | Any non\u2011U.S./EU entity that continued to do business with the listed Iranian firms or individuals faced denial of access to U.S. and EU financial markets. This \u201cthreat\u2011of\u2011exclusion\u201d forced banks in Asia, the Middle East and Africa to scrub Iranian counterparties from their books. | The secondary\u2011sanctions closed the last remaining loopholes, ensuring that the sanctions regime was truly global and that Iran could not simply reroute transactions through third\u2011party jurisdictions. |\n| **Clear, Publicly Stated Goal** | All coalition statements repeatedly quoted the single demand: **\u201cImmediate suspension of uranium enrichment above 3.67\u202f% and cessation of ballistic\u2011missile tests.\u201d** The language was identical across every press release, diplomatic note and UN Security Council briefing. | The unanimity removed any ambiguity.
