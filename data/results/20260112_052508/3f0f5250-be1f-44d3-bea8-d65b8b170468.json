      "unknown_model_response": "## Overview  \n\nThe question of whether genetically\u2011modified (GM) foods are safe for human consumption has been investigated for more than three decades.  A large body of scientific literature\u2014ranging from molecular characterisation of the introduced trait to multi\u2011year animal feeding trials and epidemiological monitoring\u2014has been evaluated by independent researchers, national regulatory agencies, and international bodies.  \n\nBelow is a structured summary of the **key types of evidence**, the **main findings** that have emerged, and the **areas where uncertainty or debate remain**.  Wherever possible, the most frequently cited peer\u2011reviewed studies, systematic reviews, and official assessments are referenced.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Types of Evidence Used to Assess GM\u2011Food Safety  \n\n| Evidence category | What it examines | Typical methods | What it can (and cannot) tell us |\n|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Molecular and compositional analysis** | DNA insertion site, protein expression, nutrient/anti\u2011nutrient levels | PCR, sequencing, mass\u2011spectrometry, nutrient profiling | Shows whether the GM crop is substantially equivalent to its conventional counterpart; does **not** prove long\u2011term health effects. |\n| **Allergenicity & toxicity testing** | Potential of the new protein to cause allergic reactions or acute toxicity | In\u2011silico homology searches, serum IgE binding, animal acute\u2011toxicity tests (e.g., mouse LD\u2085\u2080) | Detects obvious allergen or toxin properties; rare to detect subtle, chronic effects. |\n| **Animal feeding studies (sub\u2011chronic & chronic)** | Whole\u2011food effects on growth, organ health, reproduction, carcinogenicity | 90\u2011day rodent studies (OECD TG 408), 2\u2011year rodent carcinogenicity studies (OECD TG 452), sometimes larger animal (e.g., pigs, goats) trials | Directly measures physiological outcomes; limited by species differences and study duration. |\n| **Human dietary exposure & epidemiology** | Real\u2011world consumption patterns and health outcomes | Food\u2011frequency surveys, cohort studies, case\u2011control studies, meta\u2011analyses of existing data | Can capture population\u2011level signals but are confounded by many dietary and lifestyle variables; few long\u2011term prospective studies exist. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses & systematic reviews** | Synthesize all available data to assess overall risk | PRISMA\u2011guided literature searches, statistical pooling (random\u2011effects models) | Provide higher\u2011level evidence; quality depends on the underlying studies. |\n| **Post\u2011market monitoring & surveillance** | Adverse events reported after commercialization | National food\u2011safety databases, voluntary reporting systems (e.g., FDA\u2019s \u201cFood Safety Modernization Act\u201d monitoring) | Useful for detecting rare events; depends on reporting completeness. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the Bulk of the Scientific Evidence Shows  \n\n### 2.1 Consensus Statements from Major Scientific Bodies  \n\n| Organization | Year | Main conclusion (summary) | Key document |\n|--------------|------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (U.S.)** | 2016 | \u201cThere is no substantiated evidence that foods from genetically engineered plants are less safe than foods from conventionally bred plants.\u201d | *Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects* (NAS, 2016) |\n| **World Health Organization / Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO/WHO)** | 2020 | \u201cBased on current evidence, GM foods available on the market are safe to eat.\u201d | *Food Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Modern Biotechnology* (FAO/WHO, 2020) |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | 2011\u20112022 (multiple assessments) | Each GM event evaluated individually; all approved events have been found **not** to raise safety concerns for human health. | EFSA GMO Panel opinions (e.g., \u201cSafety assessment of genetically modified maize MON\u202f810\u201d 2011) |\n| **American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)** | 2012 | \u201cGM crops have been assessed for safety and have not been shown to pose any greater risk than conventional crops.\u201d | *AAAS Statement on Genetically Modified Organisms* (2012) |\n| **International Council for Science (ICSU) / International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFoST)** | 2013 | \u201cNo credible evidence of health risks directly attributable to the consumption of GM foods.\u201d | *GM Foods and",
