      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn the short run, rent control (RC) can keep the rent that existing tenants pay below market levels, which makes housing *more affordable* for those households. In the long run, however, most empirical work finds that the same controls tend to **reduce the overall supply of rental housing, lower the quality of the units that remain, and shift the affordability benefit away from low\u2011income renters toward those who were already in place**. The net effect on city\u2011wide \u201chousing affordability\u201d (the ability of the average household to obtain a decent unit at a price that does not exceed a modest share of income) is therefore usually **negative or at best neutral**, unless the rent\u2011control regime is paired with strong supply\u2011side policies.\n\nBelow is a systematic walk\u2011through of the evidence, the mechanisms that drive it, and the points on which researchers still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How rent control works \u2013 the basic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical long\u2011run outcome |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling on existing contracts** | Limits the rent that landlords can charge current tenants (often with modest annual adjustments). | Rent\u2011controlled units become \u201cscarce\u201d because they are cheaper than market equivalents. |\n| **Vacancy decontrol / \u201cturnover\u201d rules** | When a tenant moves out, the unit can be re\u2011rented at market price (or after a \u201creset\u201d period). | Landlords have an incentive to **reduce turnover** (e.g., by offering cash\u2011out buyouts) or to **convert** the unit to condos, short\u2011term rentals, or other non\u2011regulated uses. |\n| **Regulation of new construction** | Some jurisdictions tie new construction permits to a \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d or \u201crent\u2011increase\u201d formula. | Developers may **build fewer rental units** or shift to higher\u2011priced \u201cluxury\u201d segments that are exempt. |\n| **Quality\u2011maintenance requirements** | Some RC statutes require landlords to keep units in \u201cgood repair.\u201d | Enforcement is often weak; landlords may **defer upgrades** because they cannot recoup costs through higher rents. |\n| **Indexation (e.g., inflation\u2011linked)** | Allows limited rent hikes tied to CPI or a fixed % per year. | Mitigates the \u201cerosion\u201d of real rent but still leaves rents below market, preserving the scarcity incentive. |\n\n*Key insight:* **Rent control changes the price signal that coordinates supply and demand.** When that signal is distorted, market participants adjust by changing the *quantity* and *quality* of housing rather than the price.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer**\n\n*In the overwhelming majority of empirical studies, \u201cstrong\u201d rent\u2011control regimes (i.e., caps that keep rents well below market rates and that do not allow periodic rent resets) reduce the *overall* stock of rental housing and raise the *average* price that newcomers must pay.  The net effect on *affordability* for the population as a whole is therefore negative in the long run, even though the tenants who are already inside a controlled unit enjoy a permanent rent discount.*\n\nHowever, the picture is not binary:\n\n* **Incumbent\u2011tenant benefits** \u2013 existing renters who stay in a controlled unit typically pay far less than the market price for many years.  \n* **Supply\u2011side costs** \u2013 developers build fewer new apartments, owners convert rentals to condos or exempt \u201cluxury\u201d units, and landlords cut maintenance or reduce \u201camenities\u201d to preserve profitability.  \n* **Spill\u2011over effects** \u2013 rents for uncontrolled units tend to rise (often by 5\u201115\u202f% in the same city) because the controlled stock \u201cshadows\u201d the market.  \n* **Design matters** \u2013 modest controls that allow periodic rent adjustments, vacancy decontrol, or generous new\u2011construction exemptions can mitigate the supply shock, and in some cases the net affordability impact is neutral or only slightly negative.  \n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview that distinguishes what is **well\u2011established**, what remains **debated**, and what is **still unknown**.

Quick snapshot of the policy timeline\n\n| Year | Policy change | What the law did |\n|------|---------------|------------------|\n| **1979** | **Rent\u2011Control Ordinance (RCO)** adopted (City\u2011wide \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction + rent\u2011increase caps). | Caps annual rent increases at **7\u202f%** plus the regional CPI, with a \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d rule: when a tenant moves out, the unit can be re\u2011rented at market price. |\n| **1994** | **Housing Development and Rent\u2011Stabilization Amendments** | Tightened vacancy\u2011decontrol (units could stay controlled for up to 5\u202fyears after a turnover) and added a \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction protection. |\n| **2002** \u2013 **2009** | **State\u2011level \u201cHousing Accountability Act\u201d (HAA)** | Limited the ability of developers to bypass rent control by building \u201cluxury\u201d units that would be exempt; however, the HAA was weakly enforced until 2017. |\n| **2019** | **Prop\u202f2 (City ballot)** | Voted to **phase out rent control** over a 10\u2011year period (completed in 2025). The proposition was driven by a coalition that argued the controls were harming affordability. |\n| **2025 (projected)** | **Full repeal** | All remaining rent\u2011controlled units become market\u2011rate (subject only to the modest \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction rule). |\n\n> **Why San\u202fFrancisco?**  \n> It is one of the few U.S. metros where rent control has existed continuously for >40\u202fyears, and the city has a **rich data environment** (building permits, census microdata, landlord\u2011tenant court records, and the \u201cRent Board\u201d database).
