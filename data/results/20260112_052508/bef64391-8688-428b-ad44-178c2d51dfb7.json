      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a brief overview**\n\nEconomic sanctions are coercive tools that governments or international bodies (e.g., the UN, the EU, the United States) use to try to change a target country\u2019s policies without resorting to military force.  They can take many forms\u2014trade embargoes, asset freezes, financial restrictions, travel bans, or sector\u2011specific measures such as bans on oil exports or technology transfers.  Because they operate through market mechanisms rather than direct violence, sanctions are often presented as \u201csmart\u201d or \u201ctargeted\u201d ways to exert pressure.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the academic and policy literature on how sanctions *typically* affect the behavior of the countries on which they are imposed.  The evidence is mixed, and outcomes depend heavily on context, design, and the interaction of several political\u2011economic variables.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical pathways \u2013 how sanctions are supposed to work\n\n| Mechanism | What it entails | Expected influence on target behavior |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Economic cost** | Reducing a country\u2019s export revenues, limiting access to finance, raising import prices. | Creates domestic economic hardship \u2192 public pressure on leaders to change policy. |\n| **Political isolation** | Cutting diplomatic ties, limiting participation in international institutions. | Weakens the regime\u2019s legitimacy and reduces its ability to reward allies abroad. |\n| **Signalling** | Demonstrates resolve of sanctioning states, signals that further escalation is possible. | May deter future undesired actions even before costs become severe. |\n| **Targeted pressure** | Freezing assets of elites, travel bans, restricting specific sectors (e.g., nuclear tech). | Directly squeezes decision\u2011makers while minimizing broader humanitarian impact. |\n| **Deterrence / normative influence** | Embedding sanctions in a broader normative framework (human\u2011rights, non\u2011proliferation). | Encourages compliance to regain international standing. |\n\n*Key references*: Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott (2009); Drezner (2011); Peksen (2019).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical findings \u2013 what the data show\n\n### 2.1 Success rates (overall)\n\n| Study | Sample | Success definition | Reported success rate |\n|-------|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Hufbauer et al., 2009** (\u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d) | 221 cases (UN, US, EU, etc., 1945\u20112005) | Policy change or concession that sanctions sought | **~34\u202f%** achieved at least one of their stated objectives |\n| **Peksen, 2019** (meta\u2011analysis) | 74 quantitative studies | Varied (policy change, regime change, nuclear negotiations) | **~30\u201140\u202f%** effectiveness, higher for *multilateral* and *targeted* sanctions |\n| **Early & Kusek, 2021** (UN Security Council sanctions) | 115 UN sanctions (1990\u20112015) | Cessation of targeted activity (e.g., arms supply, nuclear program) | **~44\u202f%** success, with higher odds when sanctions were *comprehensive* and *enforced uniformly* |\n\n> **Take\u2011away:** Sanctions work **more often than they fail**, but \u201csuccess\u201d is usually partial, incremental, and contingent on many other diplomatic moves.\n\n### 2.2 Factors that increase the likelihood of influence\n\n| Factor | Evidence | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------|----------------|\n| **Multilateral vs. unilateral** | Multilateral sanctions are 2\u20113\u00d7 more likely to succeed (Peksen, 2019; Early & Kusek, 2021). | Reduces opportunities for the target to find alternative partners. |\n| **Targeted (smart) design** | Asset freezes and elite travel bans correlate with higher compliance (Mansfield & Milner, 2020). | Directly pressures decision\u2011makers while limiting civilian suffering, preserving domestic legitimacy of the sanctioning coalition. |\n| **Economic leverage of sanctioners** | Sanctions imposed by the United States or the EU are more effective because they dominate global finance and trade (Hufbauer et al., 2009). | Targets cannot easily substitute lost markets or financing. |\n| **Domestic political cohesion in target** | Autocratic regimes with weak institutions are *more* vulnerable to elite pressure but may also be *more* resilient if elites benefit from the status quo (Guriev & Tsyvinski",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Recent \u201cSuccess\u201d: The 2015\u20112021 Iran Nuclear Sanctions Regime  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step look at one of the most widely cited cases in the sanctions literature where **multilateral, targeted (or \u201csmart\u201d) sanctions** helped bring a sovereign state to negotiate and, for a time, to comply with a set of policy demands.  \nThe episode stretches from the early\u20112000s\u2011\u2011when the sanctions were first imposed\u2011\u2011to the 2021 renewal of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). It illustrates how the *design* of the sanctions, the *coordination* among multiple actors, and the *economic\u2011political context* of the target combined to produce a measurable policy shift.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Background \u2013 What the sanctions aimed to achieve  \n\n| Goal of the sanctioning coalition | Why it mattered to the coalition |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Stop Iran\u2019s enrichment of uranium to weapons\u2011grade levels** | Prevent nuclear proliferation and protect regional security (U.S., EU, Russia, China, and the UN). |\n| **Tie Iran\u2019s nuclear program to broader diplomatic engagement** | Create a \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d framework: sanctions as the stick, economic relief as the carrot. |\n| **Signal that non\u2011compliance would have concrete costs** | Reinforce the credibility of the Non\u2011Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime. |\n\nThe coalition that built the pressure consisted of **four pillars**:\n\n1. **United Nations Security Council (UNSC)** \u2013 Resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), 1835 (2008), and 1929 (2010) that mandated *comprehensive* arms\u2011embargoes, bans on missile\u2011related technology, and restrictions on the sale of dual\u2011use goods.  \n2. **European Union (EU)** \u2013 A parallel set of *secondary* sanctions (e.g., EU\u2011Iran Framework) that prohibited EU firms from dealing with Iranian banks and oil companies.  \n3. **United States** \u2013 The most powerful *primary* sanctions, administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). These included the 1995 Iran\u2011Libya\u2011Sudan (ILS) sanctions, the 2006 \u201cComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act\u201d (CISADA), and later the 2010 \u201cIran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act\u201d (ITRHRHA). The U.S. also used *secondary* measures that punished non\u2011U.S. firms for facilitating prohibited transactions.  \n4. **Other major economies (UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea)** \u2013 Adopted \u201caligned\u201d secondary sanctions, further shrinking the pool of willing counterparties.\n\n> **Key point:** *All four pillars acted in concert.* A firm in, say, Singapore that wanted to sell a turbine to an Iranian power plant would have to fear being cut off from the U.S. financial system, lose access to EU markets, and risk secondary UN penalties. This **multilateral coordination** dramatically reduced Iran\u2019s options for \u201csanctions\u2011busting\u201d trade.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the sanctions were *targeted*  \n\n| Targeted element | Mechanism | Immediate effect on Iran |\n|------------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **Oil sector** | OFAC designated the *National Iranian Oil Company* (NIOC) and its subsidiaries; EU banned Iranian crude imports; SWIFT blocked Iranian",
