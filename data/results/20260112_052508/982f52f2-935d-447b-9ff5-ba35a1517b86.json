      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **Pasteurized milk**: Consistently shown to be far safer for the general public. The heat\u2011treatment that defines pasteurization eliminates or dramatically reduces the most common milk\u2011borne pathogens (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*). Outbreak investigations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere attribute a very small fraction of milk\u2011related food\u2011borne illnesses to properly pasteurized milk, and most of those are linked to post\u2011pasteurization contamination rather than the pasteurization step itself.  \n\n- **Raw (unpasteurized) milk**: Carries a measurable, often substantially higher risk of causing food\u2011borne illness. Surveillance data show that raw milk is responsible for a disproportionate share of milk\u2011related outbreaks relative to its tiny share of total milk consumption. The risk is especially high for infants, young children, pregnant people, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based comparison that covers:\n\n1. **What pasteurization does (the science)**\n2. **Epidemiologic evidence of illness risk**\n3. **Nutrient and functional\u2011component considerations**\n4. **Factors that can modify risk (handling, storage, re\u2011contamination)**\n5. **Regulatory and public\u2011health perspectives**\n6. **Key uncertainties and ongoing debate**\n\n---\n\n## 1.

During milking, fecal material entered the milk (a common route for this pathogen). | Pasteurisation is a **heat\u2011kill step** that targets vegetative bacteria, including *Campylobacter*. An HTST (high\u2011temperature\u2011short\u2011time) pasteurisation of **72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fseconds** achieves a **\u22655\u2011log reduction** (\u226599.999\u202f% kill) of *Campylobacter* (and of *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*). If the milk had been heated to this temperature for the required time, the bacterial load would have been reduced from the millions of cells typically present in a contaminated raw sample to well below the infectious dose (usually <\u202f500\u202fCFU for *Campylobacter*). |\n| **Post\u2011milking handling** | After milking, the raw milk was cooled (\u2248\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C) and stored in a bulk cooler before being packaged and sold. The low temperature slowed bacterial growth but **did not kill** the *Campylobacter* that were already present. | Pasteurisation would have **inactivated** the pathogen **before** the milk entered the cooler. Even if the cooler were later contaminated (e.g., by other raw\u2011milk batches), the pasteurised product would have remained safe because the pathogen\u2019s viability would already be gone. |\n| **Distribution** | The milk was shipped in insulated coolers to retail points.

The majority (22) named the same farm (Farm\u202fA); the remaining five obtained milk from a \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d group that sourced its milk from the same herd.  \n4. **Laboratory confirmation:** Samples of raw milk collected from the farm (and from a refrigerated bulk tank) grew *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 that matched patient isolates by **PFGE (pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis)** and later by **whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS)** (\u2264\u202f5 single\u2011nucleotide polymorphisms difference).  \n\n### 1.2 Why the milk was contaminated  \n\n- **Animal reservoir:** Cattle are natural carriers of STEC (*Shiga* toxin\u2011producing *E.\u202fcoli*), often shedding the bacteria in feces without illness.  \n- **Hygiene lapses:** The farm\u2019s **milking equipment** (stainless\u2011steel bulk tank, hoses, and a milk\u2011cooling system) was **not cleaned and sanitized according to USDA\u2011FSIS \u201cSanitary Standard Operating Procedures\u201d**. Swabs from the interior of the bulk tank and the milk line tested positive for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7.  \n- **Environmental contamination:** Soil and manure near the milking area were also positive, indicating fecal contamination of the milk either **directly during milking** (e.g., dirty udders, open\u2011flow milking) or **post\u2011milking** (e.g., splashing of contaminated water).  \n\n### 1.3 What pasteurisation would have done  \n\n| Pasteurisation step (US \u201cHTST\u201d) |",

For most pathogens the **infectious dose** (the number of organisms needed to cause disease) is far higher than 10 cells, so the risk becomes negligible\u2014provided the milk is not re\u2011contaminated after the heat step.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat the heat does to the *components* of milk  \n\nBelow is a concise \u201cheat\u2011sensitivity map\u201d for the major milk constituents.

If a process can reliably achieve that, it meets the legal definition of \u201cpasteurisation\u201d in most jurisdictions.\n\n### 1.1 How the heat actually kills bacteria  \n\n1. **Protein denaturation** \u2013 Heat unfolds essential bacterial enzymes (e.g., DNA polymerase, metabolic enzymes), rendering them non\u2011functional.  \n2. **Membrane damage** \u2013 The phospholipid bilayer becomes more fluid and eventually ruptures, causing loss of cellular contents.  \n3. **DNA/RNA damage** \u2013 At >\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C, nucleic acids undergo depurination and strand breakage.  \n4. **Spore inactivation** \u2013 Most bacterial spores (e.g., *Bacillus* spp.) survive standard HTST; they are the reason why dairy plants still need **post\u2011pasteurisation sanitation** and **cold\u2011chain control**. UHT is required if you want commercial sterility (spore kill).  \n\nThe **log\u2011reduction** (how many 10\u2011fold reductions) depends on temperature, time, and the **D\u2011value** (time needed at a given temperature to reduce the bacterial population by 90\u202f%). For *C.\u202fburnetii* at 71\u202f\u00b0C, D\u2248\u202f1.5\u202fmin; 15\u202fs therefore gives \u2248\u202f5\u2011log kill.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.
