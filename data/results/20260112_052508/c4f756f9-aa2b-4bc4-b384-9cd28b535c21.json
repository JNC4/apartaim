What fluoride does in the mouth  \n\n| Step | Biological effect | Why it matters for dental health |\n|------|-------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Enamel remineralization** | Fluoride ions (F\u207b) combine with calcium and phosphate in saliva to form **fluorapatite** (Ca\u2081\u2080(PO\u2084)\u2086F\u2082), a crystal that is more acid\u2011resistant than the natural hydroxy\u2011apatite of enamel. | Teeth can repair early decay (\u201cwhite\u2011spot lesions\u201d) and are less prone to demineralisation when the pH drops after eating. |\n| **Inhibition of bacterial metabolism** | At the low concentrations found in fluoridated water (\u22480.7\u202fmg/L), fluoride interferes with the enzymes that oral bacteria (mainly *Streptococcus mutans*) use to produce acid from sugars. | Slower acid production = less enamel erosion. |\n| **Reduced plaque formation** | Fluoride can alter the composition of dental plaque, making it less acidic. | Contributes to the overall caries\u2011preventive effect. |\n\n**Result:** Systematic reviews (e.g., Cochrane 2015; US Public Health Service 2015) consistently find that community water fluoridation reduces **dental caries (cavities)** by about **20\u201340\u202f%** in children and adolescents compared with non\u2011fluoridated populations.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How much fluoride is added, and where the numbers come from  \n\n| Jurisdiction | Typical target concentration* | Rationale |\n|--------------|------------------------------|-----------|\n| United States (EPA, CDC) | **0.7\u202fmg\u202fF\u207b\u202f/\u202fL** (range 0.6\u20130.8) | Chosen in 2011 to balance maximal caries protection with minimal risk of dental fluorosis, after many studies showed that lower concentrations still gave benefit. |\n| World Health Organization (WHO) | **0.5\u20131.0\u202fmg\u202f/\u202fL** (adjusted for climate & water consumption) | Takes into account that people in hot climates drink more water, so the same concentration yields a higher total fluoride intake. |\n| European Union (varies by country) | 0.5\u20130.8\u202fmg\u202f/\u202fL | Similar considerations as WHO. |\n\n\\*The \u201ctarget\u201d is the level water utilities aim for; actual measured concentrations may vary \u00b10.1\u202fmg/L.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Safety assessments \u2013 why low levels are considered safe  \n\n| Health endpoint | Evidence base | What the data show at \u22640.7\u202fmg/L |\n|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Dental fluorosis** (mild, usually only visible as faint white lines) | Large epidemiologic surveys (NHANES, 1999\u20112016; UK National Fluoridation Study) | Prevalence of **\u201cquestionable\u201d** or **\u201cvery mild\u201d** fluorosis rises modestly when intake exceeds ~0.7\u202fmg/L, but **severe fluorosis** (pitting, brown staining) is extremely rare at \u22640.7\u202fmg/L. |\n| **Skeletal fluorosis** (painful bone disease) | Studies in regions with natural fluoride >4\u202fmg/L (e.g., parts of India, China) | No credible cases linked to the \u22640.7\u202fmg/L range used in public\u2011water programs. |\n| **Thyroid function** | Meta\u2011analysis of 13 studies (2018) found *no consistent association* between water fluoride \u22641\u202fmg/L and altered thyroid hormone levels, though very high exposures (>4\u202fmg/L) can affect the gland. | |\n| **Neurodevelopment** | Recent systematic reviews (e.g., National Toxicology Program 2020; WHO 2021) note **moderate\u2011quality evidence of small IQ reductions** at **high prenatal exposure** (\u22482\u20133\u202fmg/L) but **no robust signal** at \u2264",
