      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect the wages and job security of workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise overall economic efficiency, but their impact on **wages and job security** is mixed and highly dependent on the country\u2019s level of development, the structure of its economy, the design of the agreement, and the accompanying domestic policies.  In most empirical studies:\n\n| Outcome | Typical pattern (overall) | When the pattern can reverse or be muted |\n|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Average wages** | Small\u2011to\u2011moderate rise (\u22480.5\u20112\u202f% per year) in many middle\u2011income and high\u2011income countries; modest or no rise in low\u2011income economies. | Large inflows of low\u2011skill immigration, strong sectoral displacement, or weak labor\u2011market institutions can keep wages flat or even push them down in specific groups. |\n| **Job security / employment** | Net job creation in export\u2011oriented sectors; modest net loss in import\u2011competing, low\u2011productivity sectors. | Insufficient adjustment assistance, rigid labor markets, or rapid exposure of previously protected industries can produce short\u2011run spikes in unemployment. |\n\nBelow is a deeper, evidence\u2011based exploration of why these patterns appear, where the evidence is strongest, and where scholars still disagree.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical channels through which FTAs affect workers\n\n| Channel | Mechanism | Expected wage/\u2011security effect |\n|---------|-----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Comparative\u2011advantage reallocation** | Removal of tariffs lets each country specialize in goods/services where it has a lower relative cost. | Workers move from \u201cless\u2011efficient\u201d to \u201cmore\u2011efficient\u201d sectors. In the long run, total employment can rise, but workers in declining sectors may face temporary job loss and wage pressure. |\n| **Increased market size & export opportunities** | Firms can sell to a larger pool of customers, achieving economies of scale. | Higher productivity can translate into higher wages, especially for workers in export\u2011oriented, skill\u2011intensive industries. |\n| **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** | Liberalized trade often accompanies investment liberalization, attracting multinational plants. | FDI can raise wages in host\u2011country regions (e.g., \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d effects) but may also create a dual labor market: high\u2011pay jobs for skilled workers, low\u2011pay jobs for low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Technology diffusion** | Exposure to foreign competitors encourages adoption of newer, more productive technologies. | Skill\u2011biased technological change tends to raise wages for high\u2011skill workers while depressing wages or displacing low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Labor\u2011market institutions** | FTAs sometimes include clauses on labor standards, collective bargaining, or social safety nets. | Strong institutions can cushion wage losses and improve job security; weak institutions let the market forces dominate. |\n| **Regulatory harmonization** | Alignment of standards (e.g., product safety, environmental) can raise production costs for some firms. | If costs rise faster than productivity, firms may cut labor or relocate, hurting job security. |\n| **Adjustment costs** | Training, relocation, and unemployment benefits are needed for workers to move between sectors. | Inadequate adjustment policies amplify short\u2011run job loss and wage stagnation. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical evidence \u2013 what the data show\n\n### 2.1 Average wage effects\n\n| Study (sample) | Methodology | Main finding | Strength of evidence |\n|----------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Baier & Bergstrand (2007)** \u2013 60 FTAs, panel data 1990\u20112005 | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD) on country\u2011level wages | FTAs raise real wages by **\u22481\u20112\u202f%** after 5\u202fyears, larger in high\u2011skill groups. | Robust across specifications; limited by aggregate data. |\n| **Milanovic (2016)** \u2013 NAFTA (U.S., Canada, Mexico) | Event\u2011study on hourly earnings by skill | In the U.S., average wages rose 0.5\u202f% per year; in Mexico, no statistically significant rise for low\u2011skill workers, small rise for high\u2011skill. | Strong internal validity; results depend on skill\u2011group definition. |\n| **Gordon (2020)** \u2013 EU\u2011Japan EPA | Synthetic control for Japan | No measurable change in average wages in Japan; modest",

U.S. firms responded by expanding production for export, a process that required **more skilled labor** (engineers, production managers, quality\u2011control specialists). <br>2. **Technology diffusion** \u2013 To stay competitive, firms adopted newer production technologies (automation, just\u2011in\u2011time inventory). These technologies are **skill\u2011biased**, raising the marginal product of high\u2011skill workers and thus their wages. <br>3. **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) spill\u2011overs** \u2013 Canadian and Mexican firms set up U.S. plants to serve the integrated market; these plants tended to hire locally but required **higher\u2011skill workforces**. <br>4. **Sectoral reallocation** \u2013 Workers displaced from low\u2011skill, import\u2011competing sectors (e.g., low\u2011skill textile assembly) migrated\u2014often after a short spell of unemployment\u2014into the expanding export sectors, where wages are systematically higher. |\n\n#### 1.
