      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that aim to change a target country\u2019s behavior by restricting its access to goods, finance, technology, or diplomatic engagement.**  \nWhether they succeed depends on a mixture of *mechanistic pathways* (how the pressure is applied) and *contextual factors* (who imposes the sanctions, what the target wants, and how the international system reacts). Below is a systematic overview of the main ways sanctions can influence a target\u2019s policies or behavior, the evidence that supports each pathway, and the major limits and side\u2011effects that scholars and practitioners have documented.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical Mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Key conditions for success | Typical evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| **Economic Cost\u2011Pressure** | Reduces national income, government revenue, or the profitability of key sectors that support the objectionable policy. | \u2022 Large share of the economy is exposed to the sanction (e.g., oil, finance). <br>\u2022 Target cannot easily substitute the blocked inputs. <br>\u2022 Government is financially dependent on the affected sector. | \u2013 Oil\u2011price collapse after the 2014\u20112016 EU\u2011U.S. sanctions on Iran lowered oil exports by ~30\u202f% (EIA, 2017). <br>\u2013 Russian GDP fell 2.1\u202f% in 2022 after the \u201cfinancial\u2011sector\u201d sanctions (World Bank). |\n| **Political Incentive Alignment** | Makes the cost of maintaining a policy higher than the political benefit, nudging leaders toward policy change. | \u2022 Decision\u2011makers are responsive to elite or public opinion about economic wellbeing. <br>\u2022 There are credible alternatives (e.g., policy reversal, negotiation). | \u2013 South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime faced a comprehensive arms\u2011embargo; elite business pressure contributed to the 1990 reforms (Hufbauer et\u202fal., 2007). |\n| **Signaling & Reputation** | Sends a clear message that certain actions are unacceptable, potentially deterring future violations. | \u2022 Sanctions are credible (i.e., they are enforceable and likely to be sustained). <br>\u2022 Target cares about international legitimacy or investment. | \u2013 The 1991 Gulf War sanctions signaled to Iraq that further aggression would be costly, influencing its later willingness to negotiate UN resolutions (Drezner, 2011). |\n| **Domestic Political Disruption** | Creates internal dissent (e.g., labor strikes, protests) that forces the leadership to adjust policy. | \u2022 Civil society is able to organize and express grievances. <br>\u2022 Regime\u2019s legitimacy is already fragile. | \u2013 The 1990s UN sanctions on Iraq contributed to the rise of \u201csanctions\u2011induced\u201d opposition movements (Gowan, 2000). |\n| **Coercive Diplomacy / \u201cCarrot\u2011and\u2011Stick\u201d** | Sanctions are paired with diplomatic offers (e.g., aid, lifted sanctions) that make compliance attractive. | \u2022 Clear conditionality and a credible \u201ccarrot.\u201d <br>\u2022 Negotiation channels remain open. | \u2013 The 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) combined targeted sanctions relief with strict verification, leading Iran to curtail its enrichment program (Katzman, 2016). |\n| **Technological/Capability Denial** | Blocks access to critical technology (e.g., semiconductors, aerospace) that limits the target\u2019s ability to pursue certain programs. | \u2022 Target\u2019s program is technology\u2011intensive. <br>\u2022 Alternative suppliers are scarce. | \u2013 U.S. export controls on advanced chips in 2022 hampered Russia\u2019s missile\u2011guidance development (CSIS, 2023). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical Evidence: What Works, When, and Why\n\n### 2.1 Broad\u2011Based (Comprehensive) Sanctions\n- **Successes**  \n  - **South Africa (apartheid)** \u2013 A combination of trade bans, arms embargoes, and financial restrictions, together with internal resistance, helped push the government toward negotiations (Hufbauer, et\u202fal., *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*, 2007).  \n  - **Libya (1992\u20132003)** \u2013 UN sanctions on oil revenues and diplomatic isolation forced Gaddafi to abandon WMD programs in exchange for sanction relief (Mackenzie, *International Relations*, 2008).\n\n- **Failures / Limited Impact**  \n  - **Cuba (1960\u2011present)** \u2013 Decades of U.S. embargo failed to topple the regime; the Cuban economy adapted through Soviet/Russian aid and tourism",

What sanctions are \u2013 the \u201cmechanisms\u201d that scholars think matter  \n\n| Mechanism | Description | Typical evidence cited |\n|-----------|-------------|------------------------|\n| **Coercive pressure (price\u2011raising)** | Reduces a country\u2019s export revenues, raises import costs, or cuts off access to finance, making the status\u2011quo more costly than the demanded change. | Trade\u2011flow analyses (e.g., Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal., 2007); case\u2011studies of oil\u2011price shocks on Iraq (1990\u201193). |\n| **Elite\u2011targeting (smart/targeted sanctions)** | Freezes assets, bans travel, or restricts business of political elites and firms, hoping to create \u201cpain\u201d for decision\u2011makers without harming the broader population. | Empirical work on \u201ctargeted\u201d sanctions in South Africa (1990\u201194) and Myanmar (2007\u201113) (e.g., Peksen\u202f&\u202fStedman\u2011Jones, 2019). |\n| **Signal/communication** | Sends a clear diplomatic message that a certain behavior will be punished, thereby shaping the target\u2019s expectations and calculations. | Studies of \u201cnorm\u2011setting\u201d sanctions in the 1990s (e.g., Drezner, 2011). |\n| **Domestic political constraints** | Sanctions can shift the balance of power among elites (e.g., by cutting off revenue streams that fund patronage) or increase public dissent, forcing leaders to adjust policy. | Research on Iran\u2019s \u201cdual\u2011track\u201d sanctions (Kaufman, 2020) and on the 2014\u201115 Venezuelan sanctions (Roodman, 2019). |\n| **International isolation** | Secondary sanctions and exclusion from global financial systems can raise the cost of maintaining the targeted behavior. | Evidence from secondary sanctions on Russia after 2014 (Guriev & Zhuravskaya, 2022). |\n\n*Note:* The same sanction can operate through several mechanisms simultaneously; the relative weight of each depends on the target\u2019s economy, regime type, and the design of the sanction package.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the large\u2011scale empirical literature says  \n\n### 2.1  Meta\u2011analyses (the \u201cbig picture\u201d)\n\n| Study | Sample / Method | Main quantitative finding | Consensus status |\n|-------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* | 236 sanction episodes (1950\u20112005); binary outcome (policy change vs. no change) | **\u2248 34\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their stated policy goal; success rate rose to **\u2248 50\u202f%** when sanctions were **multilateral, targeted, and paired with diplomatic negotiations**. | Widely cited; still considered a benchmark, though later studies",

Quick Summary of the Case  \n\n| Element | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Country & period** | Sudan, 1997\u202f\u2013\u202f2005 (sanctions) \u2192 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and later 2011 secession of South Sudan |\n| **Target behaviour** | End the two\u2011decade civil war with the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) and cease support for rebel groups in the region (e.g., in Chad, Eritrea). |\n| **Sanctions type** | **Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d)** \u2013 asset freezes, travel bans, and secondary\u2011sanctions on companies linked to the Sudanese **National Security Service (NSS)**, the **Sudan Armed Forces (SAF)**, and the **Sudanese elite\u2019s oil\u2011export and construction firms**. |\n| **Key actors imposing sanctions** | United States (Executive Order\u202f12959, 1998; later 13013), European Union (Council Regulation\u202f1260/2000), United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. |\n| **Outcome** | By 2005 the Sudanese government signed the CPA, ending the north\u2011south war; the sanctions were **partly lifted** in 2006 after the agreement, and many of the listed individuals and firms were removed from the blacklist. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the Sanctions Were \u201cSmart\u201d\n\n| Feature | What the designers did | Why it mattered |\n|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| **Narrow legal list** | The first U.S. Executive Order (1998) listed **15 individuals** (top generals, the president\u2019s inner circle, senior ministers) and **8 entities** (state\u2011owned oil\u2011marketing company Sudapet, construction conglomerates, a shipping firm). Later EU regulations added a similar list. | By singling out those who **controlled revenue streams** (oil royalties, construction contracts, arms imports), the measures hit the **financial lifelines of the ruling elite** while leaving food, medicine, and most private\u2011sector jobs untouched. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific secondary sanctions** | Any non\u2011U.S. or non\u2011EU firm that dealt with a listed Sudanese entity risked being **denied access to U.S./EU financial markets**. This \u201csecondary\u201d threat forced multinational banks and oil traders to **screen every Sudan\u2011related transaction**. | The threat of being cut off from the world\u2019s biggest capital markets made foreign companies **self\u2011police** the blacklist, magnifying the pressure without a direct embargo on the whole economy. |\n| **Clear conditionality & a \u201csanctions\u2011relief\u201d roadmap** | The United States and EU repeatedly stated that **removal from the list would follow concrete steps**: (i) cessation of support for rebel groups, (ii) cooperation on a peace negotiation, (iii) transparent accounting of oil revenues. | The elite could **see a direct financial payoff** for compliance, creating an incentive structure akin to a \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d bargain. |\n| **Coordination with diplomatic incentives** | Simultaneously, the U.S. and EU **offered aid packages** (e.g., $2\u202fbillion in humanitarian assistance, later development loans) contingent on progress toward peace. | The **combined diplomatic\u2011economic package** made the cost of staying in the conflict higher than the benefit of retaining the oil\u2011revenue monopoly. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. What the Evidence Shows\n\n### 3.1 Economic Impact on the Elite\n\n| Metric | Evidence |\n|--------|----------|\n| **Oil\u2011revenue loss** | Sudan\u2019s oil production peaked at **~2.5\u202fmillion barrels per day in 2000**.
