In some countries a national agency coordinates the effort (e.g., Australia\u2019s National Firearms Agreement). | Some are \u201cvoluntary\u201d community events; others are tied to mandatory surrender laws (e.g., \u201camnesty\u201d periods). |\n| **What is offered?** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or other incentives (often $50\u2011$200 per firearm). | Incentives may be higher for certain categories (e.g., \u201chigh\u2011capacity magazines\u201d) or for surrendered firearms that are verified as functional. |\n| **What can be turned in?** | Handguns, rifles, shotguns, assault\u2011style weapons, and sometimes \u201cjunk\u201d or non\u2011functional firearms. | Some programs restrict to handguns only; others accept any firearm, including antique or replica weapons. |\n| **How is it advertised?** | Press releases, flyers, social\u2011media campaigns, radio/TV spots, partnerships with community groups, schools, or faith\u2011based organizations. | Some use \u201chard\u2011line\u201d messaging (\u201creduce street crime\u201d), others use \u201cpublic\u2011health\u201d framing (\u201ckeep families safe\u201d). |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Collected, catalogued, and either destroyed (e.g., melting, shredding) or, less commonly, stored for later law\u2011enforcement use. | In a few jurisdictions the guns are sold to collectors after a \u201cde\u2011activation\u201d process, but this is rare in buy\u2011backs. |\n| **Legal safeguards** | Participants are usually required to sign a receipt; anonymity is often guaranteed (no police record for the surrender). | Some programs require proof of ownership or a brief questionnaire; others allow \u201canonymous\u201d drop\u2011boxes. |\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Approx. **2,900\u202fkg** of metal turned in. |\n| **Evaluation design** | A **quasi\u2011experimental, interrupted\u2011time\u2011series (ITS)** analysis using Seattle\u2019s police\u2011reported crime data (2012\u20112018) and the Washington State Hospital Discharge Database for firearm\u2011injury admissions.

This expands the \u201cearly\u2011warning\u201d capacity of the system. |\n| **Standard of proof** | **Clear and convincing evidence** that the individual **poses a serious risk** of **personal injury** to themselves or others **by having access to a firearm**. | This is a higher threshold than \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d but lower than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d It requires the petitioner to present specific, articulable facts (e.g., threats, recent violent behavior, recent suicide attempt, documented mental\u2011health crisis). |\n| **Temporary (ex parte) order** | A **court can issue a temporary ERPO** **without the respondent being present**, based on the petition alone, **lasting up to 14\u202fdays** (extendable by another 14\u202fdays if the court finds continued risk). | Allows rapid removal of guns when the danger appears imminent. |\n| **Full (final) order** | After a **notice\u2011and\u2011hearing hearing** (the respondent is served and can appear), the judge may issue a **full ERPO** lasting **up to 1\u202fyear** (renewable). | Gives the respondent due process while still permitting a relatively long removal period. |\n| **Firearms subject to removal** | \u2022 All **firearms** the respondent **possesses**, **owns**, **has access to**, or **has the right to possess** (including those stored in the home of a family member). <br>\u2022 **Ammunition** may also be seized in some jurisdictions. | The law is not limited to the gun the petitioner points to; it can encompass the entire personal arsenal. |\n| **Enforcement** | **Law enforcement** must **secure, remove, and surrender** the firearms to the state\u2019s **law\u2011enforcement firearms repository** for **destruction or storage**. Failure to comply is a **criminal misdemeanor**. | Provides a concrete mechanism for physically taking the weapons off the street. |\n| **Due\u2011process safeguards** | \u2022 Petitioners must **swear under oath** that the information is true. <br>\u2022 Respondents receive **written notice** and a **right to counsel** (including a public defender if indigent). <br>\u2022 The order can be **challenged** via a **petition for a hearing** within 7\u202fdays of service. | Mirrors constitutional requirements; courts have upheld the law\u2019s constitutionality (see *Wright v. City of Seattle*, 2020). |\n| **Record\u2011keeping** | Washington\u2019s **Department of Health** maintains a **central ERPO registry** that logs the date, petitioner, respondent, and outcome of every order. | Enables statewide data collection for research and oversight. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
