      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE)** is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets (usually government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities).  By swapping cash for those assets, the central bank tries to:\n\n1. **Lower the \u201cpolicy\u201d and market interest rates** (the yield on the securities it buys falls, pulling down rates on other debt).\n2. **Push up the price of financial assets** (the extra cash bids up bonds, equities, real\u2011estate, etc.).\n3. **Improve the willingness of banks and other lenders to extend credit** (more reserves, lower funding costs).\n\nThose three channels are the main ways QE can affect different groups in the economy.  Below is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the typical distributional impacts on **households, businesses, and investors**, together with the main points of scholarly and policy\u2011maker consensus and the areas where uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Households\n\n| Mechanism | Potential Benefit | Potential Cost / Uncertainty |\n|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Lower borrowing costs** (mortgages, auto loans, credit\u2011cards) | \u2022 Mortgage rates often fall 30\u201370\u202fbps after a QE round, making home\u2011purchase or refinancing cheaper for many families. <br>\u2022 Consumer\u2011credit spreads narrow, easing debt servicing. | \u2022 Benefits accrue mainly to those who already have access to credit (higher\u2011income or better\u2011credit\u2011score households). <br>\u2022 If house prices rise faster than wages, lower rates can **increase housing\u2011price pressure**, hurting first\u2011time buyers. |\n| **Wealth effect via asset\u2011price rises** (stocks, bonds, housing) | \u2022 Rising home\u2011equity values increase net worth for owners; higher stock market valuations boost retirement accounts and mutual\u2011fund holdings. <br>\u2022 Empirical work (e.g., Bernanke & Gertler 1999; Brunnermeier & Koby 2019) finds a measurable \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d on consumption, especially for high\u2011net\u2011worth households. | \u2022 Asset\u2011price gains are **unequally distributed**: the top 20\u202f% of wealth holders hold >80\u202f% of financial assets, so the bulk of the wealth effect goes to them. <br>\u2022 Renters and low\u2011income families see little direct benefit and may face higher rents if landlords pass on higher property values. |\n| **Expectations of future inflation** | \u2022 If QE successfully lifts inflation toward target, real wages may improve for workers whose wages are indexed (e.g., public\u2011sector contracts). | \u2022 If inflation expectations become unanchored, low\u2011income households with fixed nominal incomes (e.g., Social Security, welfare) can lose purchasing power. |\n| **Credit\u2011supply side** (banks more willing to lend) | \u2022 Easier credit can help small\u2011business owners and self\u2011employed households obtain loans for investment or consumption. | \u2022 In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, many banks kept loan standards tight despite ample reserves, limiting the pass\u2011through to households (research by Kuttner 2018). |\n\n**Consensus view** \u2013 Most macro\u2011economists agree that QE\u2019s *direct* impact on ordinary consumption is modest; the main household channel is the wealth effect, which is highly skewed toward the rich.  The *indirect* channel (lower mortgage rates) can be sizable but is constrained by credit\u2011access conditions and by the state of the housing market.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Businesses\n\n| Mechanism | Potential Benefit | Potential Cost / Uncertainty |\n|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Lower cost of financing** (corporate bonds, bank loans) | \u2022 Corporate bond yields often drop 30\u201360\u202fbps after a QE announcement, reducing financing costs for capital\u2011intensive firms. <br>\u2022 Small and medium\u2011sized enterprises (SMEs) can obtain cheaper bank loans if banks expand lending. | \u2022 Larger, well\u2011rated firms benefit most because they can issue bonds; SMEs depend on bank lending, which may not expand proportionally (see \u201ccredit\u2011channel\u201d literature, e.g., Gagnon et\u202fal. 2011). |\n| **Higher asset prices** (equity valuations) | \u2022 Higher stock prices lower the cost of equity financing and can be used for acquisitions or employee compensation. <br>\u2022 \u201cMarket\u2011to\u2011book\u201d ratios improve, making it",

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Quantitative Easing (QE) Can Reach the \u201ceveryday\u2011worker\u201d part of the economy  \n\nBelow is a **step\u2011by\u2011step map** of the channels through which a central\u2011bank QE programme can (or cannot) change **wages, the price of everyday goods, and the overall cost\u2011of\u2011living** for workers who do **not** hold sizable financial assets.  After the map I summarise the **empirical evidence**, point out the **main uncertainties**, and give a **quick\u2011look case study** from the United\u202fStates and the Euro\u2011area.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Transmission chain from QE to workers\u2019 pay\u2011checks and price\u2011tags  \n\n| Step | What happens | Why it matters for ordinary workers |\n|------|--------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **(a) Central bank buys bonds / MBS** | Large\u2011scale purchases push up bond prices and push down yields (the \u201cpolicy rate\u201d and longer\u2011term rates). | Lower yields \u21d2 cheaper borrowing for banks, corporations, and households. |\n| **(b) Short\u2011term interest rates fall** (or stay low) | Banks\u2019 cost of funding falls; the Fed\u2019s target (or the ECB\u2019s deposit\u2011facility rate) stays near zero. | Cheaper bank loans \u2192 lower mortgage, auto\u2011loan, and small\u2011business loan rates. |\n| **(c) Credit\u2011supply channel** | With more reserves and lower funding costs, banks *could* extend more credit to households and firms. | If credit expands, firms can finance **new capital equipment** or **hiring**, and households can refinance mortgages (lower monthly payments). |\n| **(d) Aggregate\u2011demand channel** | Lower borrowing costs stimulate consumption (especially durable goods) and investment, raising **overall demand** for labour. | Higher demand for workers \u2192 **downward pressure on unemployment**, which historically raises wages (the \u201cPhillips\u2011curve\u201d relationship). |\n| **(e) Inflation\u2011expectations channel** | QE signals that the central bank is committed to keeping inflation near its target (often 2\u202f%).  Markets may adjust their expectations upward a little. | If workers expect higher future prices, **wage\u2011price negotiations** often incorporate a modest \u201cinflation premium\u201d. |\n| **(f) Commodity\u2011price / input\u2011cost channel** | Lower global rates can weaken the **exchange rate** of the domestic currency (e.g., the dollar or euro) and can also reduce the cost of financing for commodity producers, sometimes raising commodity prices. | Higher food, energy, or raw\u2011material prices affect the **cost of living**\u2014especially for low\u2011income households that spend a larger share of income on these items. |\n| **(g) Rental\u2011price channel** | Rising house\u2011price indices (the wealth effect) can push up **rents** because landlords raise rents to reflect higher property values. | Renters\u2014who are typically lower\u2011income\u2014feel a direct cost increase even if mortgage rates fall. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** QE can raise wages *indirectly* by lifting demand for labour, but the same policy can also push up some everyday prices (especially rents and commodities). The net effect on a typical worker\u2019s real purchasing power depends on the balance of these forces.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What the empirical literature tells us  \n\n| Study (region / period) | Main finding on **wages** | Main finding on **consumer\u2011price inflation** (especially for everyday goods) | How strong is the evidence? |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Bernanke, Gertler & Watson (1997)** \u2013 U.S. model of QE\u2011type balance\u2011sheet expansion | A 100\u2011bp fall in the long\u2011term rate raises the \u201cnatural\u201d rate of unemployment by **\u2248\u202f0.2\u202f%** \u2192 modest upward pressure on wages. | Small effect on headline CPI (<\u202f0.1\u202f%/yr), larger on **core** CPI (\u2248\u202f0.2\u202f%/yr). | Theoretical model; later empirical work supports only a modest wage response. |\n| **Kuttner (2018, \u201cMonetary Policy Shocks and the Housing Market\u201d)** \u2013",
