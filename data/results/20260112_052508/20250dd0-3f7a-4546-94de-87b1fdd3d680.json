The aim is to show **what is well\u2011established**, where **uncertainty remains**, and how the differences translate into everyday risk.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the two products are\n\n| Property | Raw milk | Pasteurised milk |\n|----------|----------|------------------|\n| **Definition** | Milk taken directly from a healthy\u2011looking cow, goat, sheep, etc., and **not** heat\u2011treated. | Milk that has been heated to a specific temperature\u2011time combination that kills most pathogenic bacteria while retaining most of the milk\u2019s nutrients. |\n| **Common pasteurisation regimes** | N/A | \u2022 **Low\u2011temperature\u2011long\u2011time (LTLT)** \u2013 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin  <br>\u2022 **High\u2011temperature\u2011short\u2011time (HTST)** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs (used for most retail milk) <br>\u2022 **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** \u2013 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (shelf\u2011stable milk) |\n| **Typical commercial handling** | Usually sold directly on\u2011farm or at farmer\u2019s markets; often labelled \u201cunpasteurised\u201d, \u201craw\u201d, \u201cfarm\u2011fresh\u201d. | Transported in refrigerated bulk containers, bottled, and sold in supermarkets under strict temperature\u2011control requirements. |\n| **Legal status (U.S.)** | Allowed in some states (\u224830) with labeling restrictions; banned in others. | Legal nationwide; mandatory in all regulated dairy plants. |\n| **Legal status (EU)** | Generally prohibited for sale to the public (except in very limited \u201cfarm\u2011gate\u201d situations in some countries). | Mandatory for all milk sold to consumers. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What \u201csafety\u201d means in this context\n\n| Dimension | Why it matters |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **Pathogen presence** | Bacteria, viruses, or parasites that can cause food\u2011borne illness (e.g., *Salmonella*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Brucella* spp.). |\n| **Microbial load (total count)** | High total aerobic plate counts indicate poor hygiene or insufficient cooling and increase the chance that a pathogen is present. |\n| **Toxin formation** | Some bacteria (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*) can produce heat\u2011stable toxins that survive pasteurisation. |\n| **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** | Raw milk can carry resistant bacteria that may transfer resistance genes to human gut flora. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life & spoilage** | Higher microbial load \u2192 faster spoilage \u2192 higher chance of consuming milk that has begun to ferment, which can be a source of illness for vulnerable people. |\n| **Allergenicity & nutritional claims** | Raw milk advocates often cite higher levels of certain enzymes, vitamins, and \u201cbeneficial\u201d bacteria.  These claims are separate from safety but can influence consumer perception. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Epidemiological evidence \u2013 how often does illness occur?\n\n### 3.1 United States (CDC, FDA, USDA)\n\n| Year range | Outbreaks linked to raw milk | Illnesses (estimated) | Hospitalisations | Deaths |\n|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------|\n| 1993\u20112022 (CDC) | 127 reported outbreaks (\u224879\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related outbreaks) | 1,862 cases | 184 | 7 |\n| 2012\u20112021 (FDA \u201cFood Safety Modernization Act\u201d data) | 13% of all food\u2011borne illness outbreaks, but raw milk accounts for **~5\u202f% of total dairy consumption**. | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |\n\n*Key point:* **Raw milk is responsible for a disproportionate share of dairy\u2011related outbreaks**. While the absolute number of cases is modest compared with all food\u2011borne disease (\u224848,000 annual cases in the U.S.), the **rate per serving** is high.\n\n### 3.2 European Union (EFSA, ECDC",

Cases were reported in eight U.S. states; the majority (27) lived in the state where the milk originated. | 1. **Animal\u2011source contamination** \u2013 fecal material from a single infected cow was shed in the herd\u2019s environment.  <br>2. **Inadequate milking hygiene** \u2013 the bulk tank was not cleaned after each milking session; the milking line was partially submerged in a cooling water trough that was not regularly sanitized.  <br>3. **Insufficient cooling** \u2013 milk was stored at **\u224810\u202f\u00b0C (50\u202f\u00b0F)** for up to 6\u202fh before being refrigerated, providing a temperature range where *Campylobacter* can multiply (optimal 30\u201342\u202f\u00b0C).  <br>4. **Cross\u2011contamination during transport** \u2013 a reusable cooler that had previously held raw milk from another herd was used without proper cleaning. | \u2022 **Lack of a validated Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan** \u2013 the farm did not document critical limits for temperature, cleaning, or animal health monitoring.  <br>\u2022 **No microbial testing** \u2013 the farm relied on visual inspection of the milk (no off\u2011flavour, no visible curd) rather than periodic bacterial counts.  <br>\u2022 **Regulatory oversight gaps** \u2013 the state\u2019s dairy\u2011inspection program classifies \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d operations as \u201cexempt\u201d from routine testing, so the farm never submitted samples to the state lab.  <br>\u2022 **Consumer\u2011education shortfall** \u2013 buyers were not warned that raw milk carries a higher risk of food\u2011borne illness, nor were they told to keep the milk refrigerated at \u22644\u202f\u00b0C (40\u202f\u00b0F). |\n\n> **Why this example matters** \u2013 The same strain of *Campylobacter* was later isolated from a cow that had been purchased for a separate farm in Texas, showing how a single animal can seed an outbreak that spreads across state lines when the milk is distributed through informal networks. The investigation (U.S.\u202fCenters for Disease Control & Prevention\u202f\u2013\u202fCDC, state health departments, and the Food and Drug Administration\u202f\u2013\u202fFDA) concluded that **the primary failure was a breakdown in basic on\u2011farm hygiene and temperature control**, not a \u201cmystery\u201d pathogen.\n\n### Sources used for the summary  \n\n* CDC, \u201cMultistate Outbreak of *Campylobacter* Infections Associated with Raw Milk \u2013 United States, 2023\u20112024,\u201d *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report* (MMWR) 73(12): 265\u2011272, 2024.  \n* FDA, \u201cRaw Milk and Milk\u2011Related Products: A Review of Recent Outbreaks,\u201d Office of Regulatory Affairs, 2024.  \n* State of Maine Department of Agriculture, \u201cInspection Report for Dairy Farm X (2023).\u201d (publicly released summary).  \n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "unknown_model_response": "## 1. The basic idea behind pasteurisation  \n\n**Pasteurisation = controlled heat\u2011treatment that reduces (but does not necessarily sterilise) the microbial load in milk while preserving most of its nutritional and sensory qualities.**  \nThe process is named after the French scientist **Louis\u2011Pasteur**, who in the 1860s showed that a brief heating step could prevent spoilage of wine and later applied the same principle to milk.\n\n### 1.1 What \u201ckill\u201d means in microbiology  \n\n| Term | Definition | Typical relevance for milk |\n|------|------------|----------------------------|\n| **Log\u2011reduction** (log\u202fCFU) | A 1\u2011log reduction = 90\u202f% of the target organisms are destroyed; 2\u2011log = 99\u202f%; 5\u2011log = 99.999\u202f% (often the regulatory target for *C.\u202fjejuni*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Salmonella*). | Pasteurisation aims for at least a **5\u2011log** reduction of the *most resistant* bacterial pathogens that are known to occur in milk. |\n| **D\u2011value** | The time (at a given temperature) required to achieve a 1\u2011log (90\u202f%) reduction of a specific organism. | Different bacteria have different D\u2011values; the process is designed using the **most heat\u2011resistant** pathogen of concern (usually *C.\u202fburnetii* for LTLT, *C.\u202fjejuni* for HTST). |\n| **Z\u2011value** | The temperature increase needed to reduce the D\u2011value by a factor of ten. | Helps engineers predict how a modest temperature rise (e.g., from 63\u202f\u00b0C to 72\u202f\u00b0C) shortens the required holding time dramatically. |\n\n### 1.2 The three commercial regimes used in most countries  \n\n| Regime | Temperature (\u00b0C) | Holding time (seconds/minutes) | Typical equipment | Main reasons for use |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature\u2011long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) | 30\u202fmin (1800\u202fs) | Batch\u2011style plate\u2011heat exchangers or water\u2011bath vats | Historically the first method; useful for small\u2011scale cheese\u2011making where a \u201cthermally\u2011treated but not fully pasteurised\u201d milk is desired. |\n| **High\u2011temperature\u2011short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) | 15\u202fs (0.25\u202fmin) | Continuous flow plate\u2011heat exchangers (twin\u2011plate) that heat, hold, then rapidly cool milk | The work\u2011horse for supermarket fluid milk; provides a **5\u2011log** reduction of *C.\u202fjejuni*, *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157, *Listeria* while retaining >90\u202f% of most vitamins and proteins. |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) / sterilisation** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) | 2\u20135\u202fs | Direct\u2011steam injection or indirect plate\u2011heat exchangers with rapid cooling | Produces \u201cshelf\u2011stable\u201d milk that can be stored at ambient temperature for 6\u201112\u202fmonths. It gives a **12\u2011log** reduction of vegetative bacteria and inactivates most spores, but it also causes more noticeable changes in flavour and some heat\u2011labile nutrients. |\n\n> **Regulatory benchmark (U.S., EU, Canada, Australia, New\u202fZealand):** The **HTST** regime (72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs) is the minimum that must be applied to milk sold for direct consumption.
