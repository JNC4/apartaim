The classification reflects the strength of evidence, not a precise risk magnitude. | Processed meat \u2013 colorectal; red meat \u2013 colorectal (probable) |\n| **Randomized controlled feeding trials** (short\u2011term) | Show that high intake of processed meat can increase biomarkers linked to carcinogenesis (e.g., N\u2011nitroso compounds, heme iron oxidation products). | Biomarkers, not direct cancer outcomes |\n\n### How Much Red Meat Is Considered \u201cHigh\u2011Risk\u201d?\nPublic\u2011health agencies have set practical intake limits based on the evidence:\n\n| Agency | Recommendation for **unprocessed red meat** | Recommendation for **processed meat** |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **World Cancer Research Fund / AICR (2020)** | \u2264\u202f3 servings per week (\u2248\u202f350\u202fg cooked weight) | \u2264\u202f1.5 servings per week (\u2248\u202f50\u202fg processed meat per day) |\n| **American Institute for Cancer Research** | Same as above | Same as above |\n| **US Dietary Guidelines (2025\u20112030)** | No specific limit, but suggest lean cuts and moderation; advise limiting processed meat | Advise limiting processed meats; recommend choosing lean, unprocessed options more often |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | No quantitative limit, but encourage \u201cmoderate\u201d consumption | Recommend reducing processed meat intake as part of a healthy diet |\n\nIn practical terms, a \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d level would be **regularly eating more than 500\u202fg (c",
