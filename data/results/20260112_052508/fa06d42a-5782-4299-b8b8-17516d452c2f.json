What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is  \n\n| Element | Typical practice | Variations / notes |\n|---------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Who runs it?** | Local police departments, city governments, or state\u2011level agencies. In some countries (e.g., Australia) the national government coordinates the program. | Some NGOs or community groups partner with law\u2011enforcement to publicise the event. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Residents voluntarily bring firearms to a designated site (often a police station, school gym, or community centre). | Mobile \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d sites are sometimes used to reach neighborhoods that lack transport. |\n| **What do participants receive?** | Cash (often US\u202f$50\u2013$200 per gun) or a voucher for a local store. In some programs the payment is a flat amount per person rather than per weapon. | A few programs offer only non\u2011cash incentives (e.g., gift cards, tickets) to avoid the perception of \u201cpaying for weapons.\u201d |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | The firearms are turned over to the police, logged, and then either (a) destroyed (e.g., melted down) or (b) stored as evidence. | In some jurisdictions the weapons are sold at auction to collectors after being rendered inoperable. |\n| **Legal safeguards** | Participants usually sign a short affidavit that the gun is theirs, that it is not stolen, and that they are not under a restraining order.  The gun is then removed from the registry (if one exists). | In the U.S., no federal law requires a record of each surrendered gun, but many states keep a \u201cbuy\u2011back log.\u201d |\n| **Funding** | Municipal budgets, state grants, private foundations, or a combination. | Some programs receive federal grant money (e.g., U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s \u201cProject Safe Neighborhoods\u201d). |\n| **Frequency** | One\u2011off events (often advertised as a \u201csingle\u2011day\u201d buy\u2011back) or recurring (quarterly, annually). | \u201cContinuous\u201d buy\u2011backs let people drop off guns any time at a designated location. |\n\n### Core goals that organizers usually cite\n\n1. **Remove firearms from the community** \u2013 especially weapons that are old, unsafe, or likely to be used in impulsive acts.\n2. **Reduce the number of guns available to illegal markets** \u2013 by making it easier for owners to surrender weapons they no longer want.\n3. **Raise public awareness** about gun safety, storage, and the costs of gun violence.\n4. **Build trust** between law\u2011enforcement and neighborhoods that may feel over\u2011policed.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the research says \u2013 a \u201cbig picture\u201d view  \n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most frequently cited empirical work, grouped by outcome (homicide, suicide, non\u2011fatal injuries, and broader community effects).
