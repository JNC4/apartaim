At the same time, sanctions can serve **signaling** (showing resolve), **punishment**, or **norm\u2011setting** (e.g., condemning human\u2011rights abuses).\n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "truthbot_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a quick definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive, non\u2011military measures (trade bans, asset freezes, financial restrictions, travel bans, etc.) imposed by one or more states (or supranational bodies) on a target state, regime, organization, or individuals with the goal of changing some aspect of the target\u2019s behavior.  They are the most widely used tool of \u201chard power\u201d after war, and scholars have studied them for more than four decades.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the **strongest empirical evidence, the leading theoretical arguments, and the main points of disagreement** about *how* sanctions influence the behavior of the states (or regimes) they target.  Wherever possible I note the degree of scholarly consensus, highlight under\u2011examined evidence, and flag common misconceptions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The \u201cbig picture\u201d that most scholars agree on\n\n| Aspect | Consensus finding (high confidence) | Key sources |\n|--------|------------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Sanctions are a \u201ccoercive\u201d tool** \u2013 they aim to raise the cost of the status\u2011quo for the target and make an alternative policy comparatively cheaper. | \u2714\ufe0e | Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d (2009); Drezner \u201cThe Sanctions Paradox\u201d (1999). |\n| **Success rates are modest** \u2013 only a minority of sanction episodes achieve their stated policy goals. | \u2714\ufe0e | Hufbauer et\u202fal. (2009) \u2013 34\u202f% of 224 cases achieved \u201cfull compliance\u201d; 45\u202f% achieved \u201cpartial compliance\u201d.  A later meta\u2011analysis (Clemens & Walter 2020) finds 30\u201140\u202f% full success. |\n| **Target\u2011state compliance is higher when the sanctions are multilateral, targeted (rather than comprehensive), and when the target is economically interdependent with the sanctioning coalition.** | \u2714\ufe0e | Hufbauer et\u202fal. (2009); Peksen (2019) \u201cWhen are sanctions effective? A meta\u2011analysis\u201d. |\n| **Sanctions rarely cause regime change** \u2013 they are more successful at altering specific foreign\u2011policy actions than at toppling governments. | \u2714\ufe0e | Galtung (1967) early work; Drezner (2011) \u201cThe Effectiveness of Sanctions\u201d. |\n| **Costs are asymmetrical** \u2013 the target usually bears a larger share of the economic pain than the sanctioning states, especially when the sanctions are unilateral. | \u2714\ufe0e | Early studies (e.g., Karsh & Gurkaynak 1997) and recent work on \u201csanction fatigue\u201d (Haidet & Hufbauer 2022). |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The academic literature treats sanctions as a *low\u2011to\u2011moderate* probability tool for coercion.  They work best for narrow, well\u2011defined objectives, especially when a broad coalition can impose them and when the target\u2019s economy is tightly linked to the coalition\u2019s markets.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Mechanisms \u2013 *how* sanctions are supposed to change behavior\n\n| Mechanism | Empirical support | Typical outcomes |\n|-----------|-------------------|------------------|\n| **Economic pain \u2192 policy cost\u2011benefit shift** (classic \u201cprice\u2011increase\u201d model) | Strong \u2013 many case\u2011studies show GDP contraction, inflation spikes, and balance\u2011of\u2011payments crises after sanctions.  Quantitative work (e.g., Hufbauer et\u202fal. 2007; Kuran & Zickgraf 2020) finds a 1\u202f% drop in GDP raises the probability of compliance by ~3\u20115\u202f% points. | Short\u2011run reductions in imports/exports, currency devaluation, fiscal strain; may push elites to negotiate. |\n| **Domestic political pressure** \u2013 elites or public protest against the hardship. | Moderate \u2013 evidence from Iran (2006\u20112015) and Venezuela (2019\u20112022) shows protest movements citing sanctions\u2011induced shortages.  However, the \u201crally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag\u201d effect can offset this. | Can create bargaining chips for opposition, but also can be used by regimes to blame external enemies. |\n| **Elite \u201cgo",
