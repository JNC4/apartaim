No humans involved. |\n| **Phase\u202f1 clinical trial** | \u2022 Small group of healthy adult volunteers (often 20\u2011100). <br>\u2022 Primary focus: **safety** (local reactions, fever, lab abnormalities) and basic immune response. | Sponsor (pharma/biotech) + **Institutional Review Board (IRB)** at each trial site; FDA (or EMA) reviews the **Investigational New Drug (IND)** application before the trial begins. | 6\u202fmonths\u20131\u202fyear. |\n| **Phase\u202f2 clinical trial** | \u2022 Larger group (several hundred), now including the target age group (e.g., toddlers). <br>\u2022 Refine dose, schedule, and continue safety monitoring; measure **immunogenicity** (antibody titers, T\u2011cell responses). | Same oversight as Phase\u202f1; an **Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)** periodically reviews interim data. | 1\u20132\u202fyears. |\n| **Phase\u202f3 clinical trial** | \u2022 **Pivotal** trial: thousands to tens of thousands of children, usually in multiple countries. <br>\u2022 Compare vaccine vs. placebo or vs. an already\u2011licensed comparator. <br>\u2022 Primary endpoints: **prevention of disease** and **rate of serious adverse events (SAEs)**. | FDA/EMA must **inspect trial sites**, review the **Biologics License Application (BLA)** or **Marketing Authorization Application (MAA)** that includes all Phase\u202f1\u20113 data. An independent DSMB monitors safety continuously. | 2\u20134\u202fyears (sometimes longer for diseases that are rare). |\n| **Regulatory review & licensure** | \u2022 Agencies evaluate **risk\u2011benefit balance** using the totality of evidence. <br>\u2022 If the vaccine meets efficacy and safety standards, it receives a **licensure** (e.g., FDA\u2019s \u201cBiologics License\u201d). | FDA (U.S.), European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO\u2011Prequalification, national health ministries. | Decision can take 6\u201312\u202fmonths after submission. |\n| **Phase\u202f4 / post\u2011licensure surveillance** | \u2022 **Passive** systems: VAERS (U.S.), Yellow Card (U.K.), EudraVigilance, WHO\u2019s VigiBase \u2013 collect any reported adverse events. <br>\u2022 **Active** systems: Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), Sentinel Initiative, Post\u2011Authorization Safety Studies (PASS), and large linked electronic health\u2011record databases. <br>\u2022 **Special studies** for rare events (e.g., Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myocarditis) and for sub\u2011populations (infants <\u202f6\u202fmonths, immunocompromised). | Public health agencies (CDC, FDA, EMA, WHO) plus academic researchers; manufacturers are required to submit periodic safety reports. | Ongoing for the life of the product; safety signals can trigger label changes, additional warnings, or even withdrawal. |\n\n### Key safety\u2011monitoring features built into the process  \n\n1. **Independent review** \u2013 IRBs and DSMBs are composed of clinicians, ethicists, and statisticians with no financial stake in the product.  \n2. **Pre\u2011specified stopping rules** \u2013 trials are halted early if a pre\u2011defined safety threshold is crossed.  \n3. **Large sample sizes** \u2013 Phase\u202f3 trials are powered to detect relatively common side\u2011effects (\u22651 in 1,000).  \n4. **Post\u2011licensure \u201creal\u2011world\u201d data** \u2013 Because some adverse events are extremely rare (1 in\u202f100,000\u202f\u2013\u202f1 in\u202f1\u202fmillion), surveillance after the vaccine is in routine use is essential.",
