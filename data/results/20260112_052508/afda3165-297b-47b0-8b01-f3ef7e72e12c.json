      "unknown_model_response": "**The American Civil War (1861\u20111865) was the result of a complex set of political, economic, social, and cultural forces that had been building for decades.  Historians still debate how much weight to give each factor, but a broad consensus exists that the issue of **slavery**\u2014and the ways it intersected with other tensions\u2014was the central, \u201cprimary\u201d cause.  Below is a synthesis of the main reasons, the evidence that supports them, and the historiographic debates that surround each point.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1.

Abolitionist literature (e.g., *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin*, 1852) and the growing antislavery press made the moral dimensions public. | \u2022 *The North Star* (Frederick Douglass) and *The Liberator* (William Lloyd\u202fGarrison). <br>\u2022 Congressional debates on the \u201cFugitive Slave Act\u201d (1850). | Made slavery a national political issue, not just a regional one. |\n| **Economic dependence on slave labor** | The Southern economy was built on cotton, tobacco, and rice plantations that relied on enslaved labor. The \u201cCotton Kingdom\u201d produced >\u202f75\u202f% of world cotton by the 1860s. | \u2022 1860 Census: 3.9\u202fmillion enslaved persons (\u2248\u202f12\u202f% of the total U.S. population). <br>\u2022 \u201cKing Cotton\u201d speeches (e.g., John C. Calhoun, 1837). | Threatened Southern prosperity if slavery were limited or abolished. |\n| **Legal and constitutional disputes** | The Constitution left the regulation of slavery to the states, but federal legislation (e.g., the Missouri Compromise 1820, Compromise of 1850, Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act 1854, Dred Scott v.\u202fSupreme Court 1857) repeatedly forced the nation to decide whether new territories could be slave or free. | \u2022 Text of the Missouri Compromise (1820). <br>\u2022 Supreme Court opinion in *Dred Scott* (1857). | Each compromise temporarily eased tension but also exposed the fragility of the Union; the Dred Scott decision inflamed Northern opposition. |\n\n**Historiographic note** \u2013 The \u201ctraditionalist\u201d school (e.g., James Ford Rhodes, early 20th\u202fc.) argued that the war was primarily a \u201cslavery war.\u201d  Revisionists in the 1930s\u201350s (e.g., Charles A. Beard) downplayed slavery and emphasized economic class conflict, while post\u2011revisionists (e.g., James McPherson, 1988) restored slavery to the central cause but acknowledged the interplay of politics and culture.  Most modern scholars (e.g., Eric Foner, 2010) agree that slavery was the *primary* cause, though they stress its linkage to other factors.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Political Conflict over the Expansion of Slavery\n\n| Event | What happened | Why it mattered |\n|-------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Missouri Compromise (1820)** | Admitted Missouri as a slave state, Maine as a free state, and barred slavery north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 line. | First major national attempt to balance free vs. slave representation; set a geographic line that would later be contested. |\n| **Compromise of 1850** | Admitted California as free; allowed Utah & New Mexico to decide via popular sovereignty; strengthened Fugitive Slave Act. | Heightened Northern outrage over the Fugitive Slave Act; showed the limits of \u201ccompromise.\u201d |\n| **Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act (1854)** | Repealed the Missouri line; introduced \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d for Kansas and Nebraska. | Sparked \u201cBleeding Kansas,\u201d a violent proxy war that demonstrated how territorial expansion could erupt into armed conflict. |\n| **Dred Scott Decision (1857)** | Supreme Court ruled that African Americans could not be citizens and that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories. | Undermined the Missouri Compromise; convinced many Northerners that the federal government was siding with slave interests. |\n\n**Evidence** \u2013 Congressional records, newspaper editorials",

Brown\u2019s justification was that \u201cthe only good slave is a dead slave\u201d and that violent resistance was necessary when the political process was being subverted.

Why Kansas mattered to the whole country  \n\n| Aspect | Why it mattered nationally |\n|--------|----------------------------|\n| **The Kansas\u2011Nebraska Act (May\u202f1854)** | Repealed the Missouri Compromise\u2019s 36\u00b030\u2032 line and introduced **\u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d** \u2013 the idea that the settlers of a territory would decide whether slavery was legal.

African\u2011American status** | \u201cThey [Africans] are not citizens of the United States.\u201d | Southern slaveholders could claim that Black people\u2014whether free or enslaved\u2014were legally outside the political community, reinforcing the idea that slavery was a \u201cprivate\u201d institution not subject to constitutional protection of rights. |\n| **2. Congressional power over the territories** | The Missouri Compromise (1820) that barred slavery north of 36\u00b030\u2032 was **unconstitutional** because it violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \u201cDue Process\u201d clause: Congress could not deprive a slaveholder of property (i.e., his slaves) without due process. | By striking down the compromise, the Court removed the only federal mechanism that had limited the spread of slavery. Southern leaders interpreted this as a clear signal that the federal government would *protect* slave\u2011holder property rights everywhere. |\n| **3. Status of Dred Scott** | Because Scott was a Black man, he could not sue in federal court; thus his claim to freedom was dismissed. | The decision reinforced the notion that Black people could not use the legal system to challenge their status, a reassurance to slave\u2011owners that their \u201cproperty\u201d could not be contested in the courts. |\n| **4. Congressional power in the territories** | While the Court said Congress *could* ban slavery in the territories, it could not do so **without** violating the Fifth Amendment. In practice this meant any ban would be illegal. | Southern politicians seized on the wording \u201ccould\u201d to argue that the *possibility* of a ban was a theoretical loophole, while the *practical* effect was that slavery could not be barred in any new territory. |\n\n**Primary source** \u2013 The full opinion (U.S. Reports, Vol.\u202f60, 1857) is reproduced in the *Library of Congress* digital collection.
