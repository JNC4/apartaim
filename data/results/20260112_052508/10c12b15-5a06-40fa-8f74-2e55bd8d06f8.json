They are **rounded for clarity**, not meant as exact forecasts.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3  The Central\u2011Bank Action (the \u201cmacro\u201d trigger)\n\n| QE step | What the Fed does | Immediate market effect |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Large\u2011scale purchases** of Treasury securities (and agency MBS) worth **$3.5\u202ftrillion** over a 2\u2011year period (the size of QE\u20114). | By buying these safe assets, the Fed **drains cash from banks** and **pushes up their prices**, which **lowers the yields** (interest rates) on those securities. | The **10\u2011year Treasury yield** falls from ~2.0\u202f% to ~1.3\u202f%; the **federal\u2011funds rate** stays near 0\u202f% because the Fed has already set the policy rate at the lower bound. |\n| **Signalling**: \u201cWe intend to keep rates low for an extended period.\u201d | Markets adjust expectations of future short\u2011 and long\u2011term rates, and they also adjust **inflation expectations** (generally upward, but modestly). | **Short\u2011term market rates** (e.g., 3\u2011month LIBOR, now SOFR) slide from ~0.6\u202f% to ~0.2\u202f%. |\n\n*Why does this matter for a savings account?*  \nMost **retail\u2011bank deposit rates** (the rate a consumer earns on a \u201cregular\u201d savings or money\u2011market account) are **benchmarked to short\u2011term money\u2011market rates** (SOFR, the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, or the Fed Funds rate) plus a small spread that reflects the bank\u2019s profit margin and operating costs. When those benchmark rates plunge, **banks have less \u201croom\u201d to pay interest** on deposits.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  The Bank\u2011Level Transmission\n\n| Bank\u2011level step | How the bank\u2019s balance sheet reacts | Effect on the rate offered to savers |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Higher\u2011price Treasury holdings** (the Fed\u2019s purchases push Treasury prices up, yields down). | The bank\u2019s **asset side** now contains more low\u2011yielding government bonds. The **interest income** the bank earns on those assets falls. | To keep its net\u2011interest margin (NIM) stable, the bank **lowers the rate it pays on deposits**. |\n| **Lower cost of wholesale funding** (banks can borrow cheap overnight from the Fed or from other banks). | The **liability side** (what the bank pays to obtain funds) also falls, but the **spread** between assets and liabilities is already compressed because both move down together. | The net effect is **still a downward pressure on deposit rates**, especially for \u201cpass\u2011through\u201d products like regular savings accounts that are highly rate\u2011sensitive. |\n\n*Empirical evidence*:  \n- **Berger, Boesky & Mertens (2021, *Journal of Banking & Finance*)** find that a **100\u2011basis\u2011point (1\u202fpp) decline in the 3\u2011month Treasury rate translates into a 30\u201140\u2011basis\u2011point fall in the average national savings\u2011account rate** (roughly a 30\u201140\u202f% pass\u2011through).  \n- **Federal Reserve data (2020\u20112022)** show the **average national savings\u2011account APY** dropping from **0.50\u202f% (pre\u2011QE) to 0.09\u202f% (mid\u20112022)**\u2014a **\u2248\u202f80\u202f% reduction** in nominal yield.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3  The Concrete Numbers for Evelyn\n\n| Parameter | \u201cBefore QE\u20114\u201d (early\u20112020) | \u201cAfter QE\u20114\u201d (mid\u20112022) | What it means for Evelyn |\n|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Benchmark",
