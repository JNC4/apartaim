      "unknown_model_response": "**How sanctions are meant to work**\n\n| Step | What the sanctioner expects | Why it should matter to the target |\n|------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **1. Create a cost** | Restrict trade, finance, investment, or travel for the target state (or specific firms, elites, sectors). | The target\u2019s economy loses revenue, foreign\u2011exchange, or access to critical inputs. |\n| **2. Raise the political price of the objectionable behavior** | The loss of economic benefits (or the threat of further loss) makes continuing the policy \u201cmore costly\u201d than stopping it. | Leaders must weigh the pain of sanctions against the perceived benefits of the policy they are defending (e.g., a nuclear program, territorial aggression, human\u2011rights violations). |\n| **3. Induce internal pressure** | Economic pain can weaken the regime\u2019s patronage networks, lower living standards, or create elite\u2011level financial losses. | Domestic constituencies (businesses, technocrats, the public) may push the leadership to change course, or elites may defect and force a policy shift. |\n| **4. Signal resolve and isolate** | Multilateral sanctions aim to show a united front, reducing the target\u2019s ability to find alternative partners. | Isolation raises the political cost of defiance and makes \u201cbreaking out\u201d of the sanctions regime harder. |\n\n**Key design elements that theory says matter**\n\n| Design feature | Expected effect | Evidence of importance |\n|----------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| **Clarity of objectives** | Leaders know exactly what must change to have sanctions lifted. | Higher success when goals are specific and time\u2011bound (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2007). |\n| **Multilateral vs. unilateral** | More partners = fewer loopholes, greater economic impact. | Multilateral sanctions are roughly twice as likely to achieve goals (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.,\u202f2007). |\n| **Targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) vs. comprehensive** | Focus on elites, military, or finance to avoid civilian suffering and maintain domestic support for the sanctioner. | Targeted sanctions are less likely to cause humanitarian backlash while still pressuring decision\u2011makers (Drezner,\u202f2011). |\n| **Severity & duration** | Sufficient pressure must be sustained long enough for the target to feel the cost. | Too\u2011weak or short\u2011lived sanctions often fizzle; overly harsh sanctions can provoke \u201crally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag\u201d effects (Galtung,\u202f1967). |\n| **Availability of substitutes** | If the target can easily reroute trade (e.g., via a friendly third country), impact is blunted. | Sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil were partially mitigated by sales to China and Russia (Krepon & Wintrobe,\u202f2020). |\n\n---\n\n### What the empirical record says\n\n| Study (sample) | Overall success rate* | Conditions that raise success |\n|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007)** \u2013 221 sanction cases (1945\u20112005) | **\u224834\u202f%** achieved at least one of their stated goals | Multilateral, clear objectives, limited scope, and use of \u201cleveraging\u201d (threat of escalation) |\n| **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 117 cases (1970\u20112009) | **\u224830\u201140\u202f%** depending on definition of success | Targeted sanctions + strong domestic opposition to the regime |\n| **Moran (2020)** \u2013 43 cases of \u201csmart\u201d sanctions (2000\u20112018) | **\u224845\u202f%** when elite assets were frozen and financial channels were cut | Presence",

The overlapping bans left few \u201csanction\u2011free\u201d loopholes. |\n| **Targeted (or \u201csmart\u201d) elements** | \u2022 **Financial restrictions** \u2013 Freezing of South\u2011African sovereign bonds and denial of new credit lines. <br>\u2022 **Arms & dual\u2011use technology embargo** \u2013 Specifically prohibited weapons, aircraft, and related parts, choking the military\u2019s ability to sustain its security apparatus. <br>\u2022 **Investment bans on key sectors** \u2013 Mining (gold, platinum), finance, and heavy industry were singled out, rather than a blanket trade embargo that would have harmed the entire civilian population. <br>\u2022 **Travel bans on senior officials** \u2013 South\u2011African officials were denied visas to the U.S., U.K., and many EU states, creating personal costs for the ruling elite. | By focusing on the regime\u2019s *revenue streams* and *military capability* while leaving basic food and medicine largely untouched, the sanctions minimized humanitarian backlash and kept domestic support for the policy strong in the sanctioning countries. |\n| **Result** | \u2022 **Economic pressure** \u2013 South Africa\u2019s foreign\u2011exchange reserves fell from ~US\u202f$3\u202fbillion (early\u20111980s) to <\u202fUS\u202f$1\u202fbillion by 1990; foreign direct investment dropped by >\u202f70\u202f% (World Bank data). <br>\u2022 **Political pressure** \u2013 Elite business leaders (e.g., Anglo\u2011American, De Beers) lobbied the government for reform; opposition parties gained space as the ruling National Party\u2019s legitimacy eroded. <br>\u2022 **Negotiated settlement** \u2013 In 1990 President F.\u202fW.\u202fde\u202fKlerk announced the release of Nelson\u202fMandela and the start of negotiations to end apartheid. The sanctions were formally lifted in 1993\u20111994 after the first democratic elections. | The combination of a *single, well\u2011communicated demand* (end apartheid), *broad international participation*, and *targeted pressure on the regime\u2019s finances and military* created a cost that the South African leadership judged higher",
