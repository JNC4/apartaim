      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a large\u2011scale purchase of financial assets by a central bank \u2013 works through several transmission channels, and each channel can affect groups of households and firms in different ways.**  \nBelow is a systematic overview of the most\u2011studied channels, the groups that are likely to benefit or lose, the empirical evidence that supports those claims, and the points that remain contested in the literature.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How QE works (a quick refresher)\n\n| Step | What the central bank does | Main macro\u2011economic goal |\n|------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Asset purchases** | Buys government bonds (and sometimes corporate bonds, mortgage\u2011backed securities, or even equities) from banks and other financial institutions. | Lowers the policy\u2011rate and long\u2011term yields, expands the monetary base. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011balance effect** | By removing safe assets from the market, QE pushes investors into riskier assets (stocks, high\u2011yield bonds, real estate). | Raises the price of those assets, reduces borrowing costs for firms and households. |\n| **Expectations channel** | Signals that the central bank will keep rates low for an extended period (\u201cforward guidance\u201d). | Influences consumption, investment, and wage\u2011setting behaviour. |\n| **Liquidity/Bank\u2011capital channel** | Banks receive cash in exchange for assets; the extra reserves can improve their balance\u2011sheet capacity to lend. | Encourages new credit to the private sector. |\n\nThe distributional impact depends on how each of these channels interacts with the *ownership* of assets, the *need* for credit, and the *exposure* to inflation.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Groups that tend to **gain** from QE  \n\n| Group | Why they benefit | Key empirical findings |\n|-------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Owners of financial assets (stocks, bonds, REITs, mutual funds)** | Asset\u2011price boost from the portfolio\u2011balance effect; lower yields make equities relatively more attractive. | *Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens & Tong (2011)* found that U.S. QE1 raised S&P\u202f500 prices by \u2248\u202f5\u202f% in the first six months. *Baker, Bloom & Davis (2022)* show that the \u201cwealth effect\u201d from rising equity prices accounts for roughly half of the stimulus to consumption in the U.S. post\u20112008 QE rounds. |\n| **Home\u2011owners** (especially those with mortgage debt) | Lower long\u2011term Treasury yields translate into cheaper mortgage rates; rising house prices increase home\u2011equity wealth. | In the Euro\u2011area, *Baker, Bloom & Davis (2020)* estimate a 0.5\u202f% increase in house\u2011price indices per 100\u2011basis\u2011point drop in 10\u2011year yields due to QE. |\n| **Borrowers (households and firms) with existing debt** | Lower nominal interest rates reduce debt\u2011service payments, freeing up income for consumption or investment. | The Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cFlow of Funds\u201d data show that corporate debt\u2011service costs fell by \u2248\u202f$70\u202fbillion per year during QE2 (2010\u20112011). |\n| **Export\u2011oriented firms in economies where QE leads to a weaker domestic currency** | A depreciated exchange rate improves competitiveness abroad. | *Gagnon, Ranciere & Sack (2018)* document a 2\u20113\u202f% boost in U.S. export volumes following QE3, largely via the exchange\u2011",
