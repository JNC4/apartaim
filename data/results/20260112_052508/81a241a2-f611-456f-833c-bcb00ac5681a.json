The goal is to give you a \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d view, not a prescription.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What an FTA does, in plain language  \n\n| Feature of an FTA | Typical economic consequence | How it can touch workers |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Tariff elimination** (or reduction) on most goods | Lower import prices; export\u2011oriented sectors gain market access | Consumers (including workers) pay less for imported goods; producers in export\u2011oriented industries may expand and need more labor. |\n| **Removal of non\u2011tariff barriers** (e.g., quotas, licensing rules) | Easier cross\u2011border supply chains | Firms can import intermediate inputs cheaper, which can raise productivity and shift labor demand toward higher\u2011skill tasks. |\n| **Rules of origin & customs\u2011procedures simplification** | Faster, cheaper trade flows | Reduces \u201cadministrative drag\u201d for firms, potentially encouraging expansion and hiring. |\n| **Investment\u2011protection chapters** (e.g., ISDS, investor\u2011state dispute settlement) | Guarantees for foreign investors | May attract foreign direct investment (FDI) that creates jobs, but can also make it harder for governments to change regulations (including labor rules). |\n| **Labor\u2011rights provisions** (in newer FTAs) | Minimum standards, enforcement mechanisms | Can raise wages or improve safety where they are enforced, but compliance varies. |\n| **Dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms** | Predictable legal environment for trade disputes | Provides firms with certainty, which can encourage expansion and hiring, but may also limit policy space for governments. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The \u201cbig\u2011picture\u201d macro evidence  \n\n| Finding | Typical source | Interpretation for workers |\n|---------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| **GDP per\u2011capita rises on average** | Meta\u2011analyses of the World Bank, IMF, and academic surveys (e.g., *World Trade Organization, 2020*; *Baier & Bergstrand, 2007*) | Higher national income can translate into higher real wages, but the distribution of those gains matters. |\n| **Export\u2011oriented sectors expand** | Firm\u2011level studies of NAFTA, EU\u2011EU FTAs, and the CPTPP (e.g., *Autor, Dorn & Hanson, 2013*; *Czarnitzki, 2016*) | Workers in expanding export sectors (often manufacturing, agriculture, services) tend to see higher employment and wages. |\n| **Import\u2011competing sectors contract** | Same sources; plus regional case studies (e.g., U.S. textile industry after NAFTA) | Workers in sectors that lose market share may face layoffs or wage pressure, especially if they cannot move to other jobs quickly. |\n| **Overall employment effect is modest** | Large\u2011scale studies using difference\u2011in\u2011differences (e.g., *Piermartini, 2017*; *Autor et\u202fal., 2021*) | Across the whole economy, FTAs tend to change the composition of jobs rather than the total number of jobs. |\n| **Wage effects are heterogeneous** | Studies that break results by skill, gender, region (e.g., *Baldwin & Evenett, 2020*; *Mayer\u2011Foulkes, 2022*) | High\u2011skill, mobile workers often see wage gains; low\u2011skill, immobile workers may see stagnant or falling wages. |\n| **Productivity gains** | Firm\u2011level productivity data (e.g., *De Loecker, 2020*) | Higher productivity can raise real wages, but the gains may accrue to capital owners before they filter down to workers. |\n| **Trade\u2011adjustment assistance (TAA) matters** | Evaluations of U.S. TAA programs (e.g., *Kletzer & McGill, 2020*) | When governments provide retraining, relocation, or income support, the negative impact on displaced workers is reduced. |\n\n**Consensus:**  \n- **FTAs raise aggregate income**",
