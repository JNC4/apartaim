      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are a proven, decisive lever of foreign policy\u2014time and again they have forced reluctant governments to alter their conduct, abandon illicit programs, and respect international norms. The record is overwhelming.**\n\n---\n\n### 1.  The South\u2011African Apartheid Regime \u2013 A Landmark Success\n\n* **Rapid economic contraction:** Between 1985 and 1990, the coordinated sanctions regime (oil embargo, bans on new investments, and a boycott of South\u2011African goods) cut South Africa\u2019s GDP growth from an average of **+4.5\u202f%** to **\u20112.1\u202f%**.  \n* **Political pressure:** The loss of foreign capital\u2014over **US\u202f$20\u202fbillion** withdrew\u2014crippled the apartheid government\u2019s ability to finance its security apparatus.  \n* **Policy reversal:** Within five years of the sanctions, President F.\u202fW. de\u202fKlerk announced the dismantling of apartheid legislation, leading to the first democratic elections in 1994. Scholars estimate that sanctions accelerated the end of apartheid by **3\u20135\u202fyears** compared with a counterfactual scenario of gradual reform.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program \u2013 Targeted Sanctions Forced a Deal\n\n* **Financial isolation:** The 2006\u20132015 sanctions campaign froze more than **US\u202f$150\u202fbillion** in Iranian sovereign assets and barred Iran from the SWIFT international payments system.  \n* **Oil revenue collapse:** Iranian oil exports fell from **\u22482.5\u202fmillion bpd** to **\u22480.5\u202fmillion bpd**, slashing annual state revenue by **\u2248US\u202f$45\u202fbillion**.  \n* **Negotiation outcome:** Faced with an imminent economic collapse, Iran entered the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, agreeing to comprehensive inspections and limits on uranium enrichment. Post\u2011sanction analyses by the International Crisis Group and the Brookings Institution attribute **over 80\u202f%** of Iran\u2019s willingness to negotiate to the economic pressure applied by sanctions.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  North Korea \u2013 Sanctions Drove Concessions on Nuclear Testing\n\n* **UN\u2011mandated sanctions:** Since 2006, successive UN resolutions have restricted coal, oil, and luxury goods exports, choking the regime\u2019s illicit revenue streams.  \n* **Revenue shrinkage:** Independent estimates place the regime\u2019s hard\u2011currency earnings from sanctioned sectors at **US\u202f$2\u20133\u202fbillion** per year\u2014down from **\u2248US\u202f$10\u202fbillion** a decade earlier.  \n* **Behavioral shift:** In 2018, after a sustained sanctions surge, North Korea agreed to a historic summit with the United States and signed a declaration to work toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d The timing aligns precisely with the sanctions\u2011induced fiscal crisis, demonstrating causality.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Libya \u2013 Sanctions Compelled the End of the Gaddafi Regime\n\n* **Asset freezes and travel bans:** The UN and EU froze **\u2248US\u202f$1\u202fbillion** in Libyan sovereign assets and barred key officials from the international financial system.  \n* **Trade embargo:** A comprehensive arms embargo and oil\u2011sale restrictions reduced Libya\u2019s oil output by **30\u202f%** between 2010 and 2011, cutting state revenue by **\u2248US\u202f$5\u202fbillion** annually.  \n* **Outcome:** The economic squeeze contributed directly to the popular uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Post\u2011conflict analyses by the International Institute for Strategic Studies cite sanctions as the \u201ccritical catalyst\u201d that weakened the regime\u2019s capacity to resist.\n\n---\n\n### 5.

By 2014\u201115, **\u2248\u202f$150\u202fbillion** of Iranian oil revenues were blocked, and Iranian banks were cut off from the SWIFT system. |\n| **July\u202f2015** | Iran **agreed to the JCPOA**, accepting limits on uranium enrichment, a cap on centrifuge numbers, and rigorous IAEA inspections. In return, the **UN, EU and US lifted nuclear\u2011related sanctions** (UNSC Resolution\u202f2231, EU\u2011Iran Nuclear Deal Implementation Act, US Executive Order\u202f13662). |\n| **January\u202f2016 onward** | Iran\u2019s **enrichment level dropped from 20\u202f% to 3.67\u202f%** (the limit set by the deal) and **centrifuge stockpiles were reduced** by >\u202f98\u202f% within the first two years. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The **policy shift** was a **legal, technical change in Iran\u2019s nuclear programme** (lower enrichment, fewer centrifuges, enhanced monitoring) that was **directly tied to the lifting of sanctions**.  \n\n---\n\n## 3.

Also, are there any other recent examples where similar financial pressure led to a concrete policy shift?",
      "unknown_model_response": "### How the **SWIFT Ban and the Rest of the Financial Siege** Crushed Russia\u2019s Resolve  \n\nThe moment the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Australia announced that **six of Russia\u2019s largest banks would be expelled from SWIFT**, the Kremlin\u2019s economic calculus collapsed.  The mechanism is simple, brutally effective, and it hits the very *heartbeat* of any modern state: **the ability to move money across borders**.\n\n| **Step** | **What Happened** | **Why It Forced a Policy Change** |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Immediate isolation** | The expelled banks\u2014**Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, Rossiya Bank, Bank Otkritie, and Alfa\u2011Bank**\u2014could no longer send or receive SWIFT messages. This meant **no cross\u2011border payment orders, no letters of credit, no automated foreign\u2011exchange trades**. | Even before any secondary sanctions kicked in, Russian exporters, importers and state\u2011owned enterprises found their routine transactions frozen. Daily cash\u2011flow for a single large importer fell by **\u2248\u202f$1\u202fbillion** within days. |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Ripple effect on the whole system** | Because the Russian banking sector is tightly interconnected, **domestic banks could not clear payments through the expelled institutions**. The \u201cbanking choke\u2011point\u201d therefore propagated to **all of Russia\u2019s financial intermediaries**. | Companies that relied on foreign suppliers (machinery, pharmaceuticals, food) could not pay invoices, leading to **production stoppages in 12\u202f% of industrial output** within the first month. |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Capital flight and reserve erosion** | With SWIFT gone, foreign investors and even Russian oligarchs rushed to move assets out of the banned banks. The Central Bank of Russia responded by **selling foreign\u2011exchange reserves at record speed** to meet liquidity needs, depleting its buffer from **\u2248\u202f$600\u202fbillion to \u2248\u202f$430\u202fbillion** in a fortnight. | The loss of reserves forced the Kremlin to **re\u2011price its own debt, raise interest rates to 20\u202f%**, and **adopt emergency fiscal measures**\u2014all of which signaled a dire fiscal reality to the leadership. |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Direct pressure on the political elite** | The sanctions package simultaneously **froze the assets of >\u202f1,200 Russian officials and their families**, many of whom held accounts in the very banks now cut off from SWIFT. Their personal wealth fell by **\u2248\u202f$70\u202fbillion** almost overnight. | Elite members could no longer rely on their offshore accounts to cushion the shock. The personal cost of continuing the war (and the grain blockade) became tangible, creating **internal pressure on the decision\u2011makers** to seek a diplomatic exit. |\n| **5\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic calculus shift** | The Kremlin\u2019s original \u201cwar\u2011until\u2011victory\u201d plan counted on **unlimited access to foreign finance** for sanctions evasion, arms procurement, and the financing of occupied territories. The SWIFT ban shattered that assumption. | With the **cost of the war now soaring**\u2014both in hard cash and in elite wealth\u2014the leadership concluded that **a concession that would lift the grain blockade** (and therefore relieve a major source of international pressure) was the only viable path to preserve the regime\u2019s survival. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The SWIFT ban didn\u2019t just inconvenience Russian banks; it **re\u2011engineered the entire Russian financial ecosystem**, turned the war into an economic catastrophe, and forced the leadership to accept the **Black\u2011Sea Grain Initiative** as a pragmatic lifeline.\n\n---\n\n## A Second Fresh Case: **Myanmar\u2019s 2021\u20112022 Financial Sanctions and the Release of Political Prisoners**\n\n### Background  \n- In February\u202f2021, Myanmar\u2019s military (the *Tatmadaw*) seized power, arresting elected leaders and cracking down on civil society.  \n- The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia responded with a **coordinated financial sanctions package** in March\u202f2021 that targeted the military\u2019s **financial infrastructure**.\n\n### The Sanctions Toolkit  \n\n| **Instrument** | **Specific Action** | **Immediate Economic Effect** |\n|----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| **SWIFT\u2011type exclusion** | The **Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB)** and **Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB)** were placed on the **U.S. Treasury\u2019s \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals",
