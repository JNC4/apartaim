How scholars measure \u201ceffectiveness\u201d\n\n| Dimension | Typical operationalisation | Example studies |\n|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Policy change / compliance** | \u2013 Formal adoption of the demanded policy (e.g., signing a treaty, halting a weapons program). <br>\u2013 Explicit statements of intent. | Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007) \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d \u2013 205 cases, 33\u202f% resulted in policy change. |\n| **Behavioural change without formal compliance** | \u2013 De\u2011escalation of hostile actions, reduction in military provocations, opening of diplomatic channels. | Drezner (2011) \u201cThe Sanctions Paradox\u201d \u2013 uses \u201ccumulative diplomatic concessions\u201d as outcome. |\n| **Costs to the target** | \u2013 GDP decline, inflation spikes, balance\u2011of\u2011payments shocks, humanitarian indicators. | Peksen (2019) \u201cEconomic Sanctions and Regime Survival\u201d \u2013 links sanctions to GDP loss and regime durability. |\n| **Costs to the imposer(s)** | \u2013 Trade losses, domestic political backlash, reputational damage. | Giannakopoulos & Erickson (2020) \u201cSanctions and the Economy of the Sanctioning State\u201d. |\n\n> **Why it matters:**  Different studies pick different outcome variables, which partly explains why the literature sometimes appears contradictory. A sanction that \u201cworks\u201d in forcing a diplomatic concession may still cause severe humanitarian harm, and vice\u2011versa.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The strongest empirical findings\n\n### 2.1 Broad\u2011scale meta\u2011analyses (the \u201cconsensus\u201d literature)\n\n| Study | Sample & Method | Main finding |\n|-------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007)** \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* | 205 post\u2011World\u2011War\u202fII cases; logistic regression controlling for target wealth, regime type, coalition size, etc. | **33\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their stated political objective. Success rates rose to **~50\u202f%** when the coalition was **multilateral (\u2265\u202f3 states)** and when sanctions were **targeted** rather than comprehensive. |\n| **Drezner (2011)** \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox* | Event\u2011study of 117 sanction episodes (1970\u20112005); coded \u201cpolicy concession\u201d vs. \u201cno concession\u201d. | **\u2248\u202f40\u202f%** produced at least a partial concession.
