Pathogenic species can be present at low\u2011level (often <10\u202fCFU/mL) but may multiply if the milk is not kept cold. | 10\u00b9\u201310\u00b3\u202fCFU/mL after standard high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurization (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs). Most vegetative bacteria are killed; only heat\u2011resistant spores may survive. |\n| **Key pathogens that can survive** | *Salmonella spp.*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin\u2011producing strains), *Clostridium perfringens*, *Mycobacterium bovis* (rare). Outbreaks are linked to contaminated farms, poor hygienic milking, or post\u2011milking handling. | Pasteurization destroys >99.9\u202f% of vegetative pathogens. The few that can survive are heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Clostridium* spp.) that rarely cause disease in healthy adults, and they are usually eliminated by refrigeration or later processing (e.g., cheese making). |\n| **Documented outbreak data (U.S./EU, 2000\u20112023)** | \u2022 CDC reports ~5\u20136 outbreaks per year linked to raw milk, averaging 30\u201340 illnesses per outbreak and a case\u2011fatality rate of ~1\u202f% (mostly among the elderly, immunocompromised, pregnant, or young children). <br>\u2022 EU Rapid Alert System recorded ~150 raw\u2011milk\u2011related alerts (2000\u20112022); most involved *Campylobacter* or *Salmonella*. | \u2022 Pasteurized\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks are rare (<1 per year in the U.S.) and usually stem from post\u2011pasteurization contamination (e.g., equipment, packaging). The same surveillance systems attribute <5\u202f% of total dairy\u2011related outbreaks to pasteurized products. |\n| **Regulatory stance** | \u2022 In the U.S., the FDA classifies raw milk as a \u201cfood of public health significance\u201d and allows sales only in a few states under strict \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d rules. <br>\u2022 EU Directive 2001/110/EC permits raw\u2011milk sales but requires stringent hygiene and labelling; many countries impose bans or limits. | \u2022 Pasteurization is mandatory for fluid milk sold in virtually all jurisdictions (U.S., EU, Canada, Australia, Japan). It is considered a \u201ccritical control point\u201d under HACCP food\u2011safety systems. |\n| **Nutrient & bioactive\u2011compound differences** | \u2022 Small reductions (\u22645\u202f%) in heat\u2011labile vitamins (B\u2081, B\u2086, C) and enzymes (e.g., lipase, alkaline phosphatase). <br>\u2022 Slightly higher levels of some native immunoglobulins and probiotic\u2011like bacteria. <br>\u2022 Scientific consensus: these differences are nutritionally insignificant for the general population. | \u2022 Heat destroys most native enzymes and reduces a few vitamins, but the overall macronutrient profile (protein, fat, lactose, minerals) is unchanged. Fortification (vitamin\u202fD, A) is common and compensates for any loss. |\n| **Population groups at higher risk** | \u2022 Infants, young children, pregnant women, elderly, and anyone with weakened immunity. <br>\u2022 People with chronic gastrointestinal disease or on immunosuppressive therapy. | \u2022 Same groups benefit most from pasteurized milk; the risk of severe infection is essentially negligible. |\n| **Mitigating factors** | \u2022 Strict on\u2011farm hygiene (clean udder, sanitized equipment, rapid cooling <\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C). <br>\u2022 Regular testing of bulk milk for pathogens (\u226510\u202fCFU/mL threshold in many jurisdictions). <br>\u2022 Consumption within 24\u202fh of milking and continuous refrigeration. | \u2022 Pasteurization combined with cold\u2011chain handling virtually eliminates most food\u2011borne pathogens. <br>\u2022 Additional steps (UHT, aseptic packaging) further extend safety and shelf\u2011life. |\n\n---\n\n### What the scientific literature says\n\n| Source |",

The \u201cD\u2011value\u201d for *Campylobacter* at 72\u202f\u00b0C is \u22480.02\u202fseconds, meaning one second at that temperature kills ~50\u202flog units. | A typical raw\u2011milk load of 10\u2074\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU/mL would be reduced to <1\u202fCFU per 100\u202fL \u2013 effectively zero risk. |\n| **Immediate cooling** to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C after the heat\u2011hold | Prevents any surviving spores (none of which are *Campylobacter*) from multiplying and stops growth of any post\u2011process contaminants. | Even if a few stray cells survived (which they would not), the cold temperature would keep them dormant. |\n| **Verification step** \u2013 testing for alkaline phosphatase activity | Alkaline phosphatase is heat\u2011labile; its absence confirms that the milk has received a proper pasteurisation heat\u2011hold. | Provides a built\u2011in safety check that the lethal temperature was actually achieved throughout the batch. |\n\n**Bottom line:** If the milk from Miller\u2019s Farm had been subjected to standard HTST pasteurisation before it left the farm, the *Campylobacter* present in the raw milk would have been destroyed long before anyone could drink it. The outbreak would therefore not have occurred, unless a later, post\u2011pasteurisation contamination event (e.g., a broken pipe) introduced the pathogen\u2014an event that is extremely rare and is tightly controlled under HACCP (Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points) regulations.\n\n---\n\n### A \u201cwhat\u2011if\u201d comparison: the same pathogen in a pasteurised\u2011milk scenario  \n\n| Situation | Raw\u2011milk case (2012) | Hypothetical pasteurised\u2011milk case |\n|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Initial bacterial load** | \u224810\u2074\u202fCFU/mL of *Campylobacter* (detected only after the outbreak) | Same initial",
