      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases financial assets\u2014usually government bonds and, in some programmes, mortgage\u2011backed securities or corporate bonds\u2014to inject liquidity into the financial system.**  \nBecause the policy works through a chain of market\u2011wide mechanisms (interest\u2011rate lowering, portfolio\u2011rebalancing, exchange\u2011rate movements, expectations of future inflation, and changes in credit conditions), its *distributional* consequences are spread unevenly across households, firms, financial institutions and even across countries. Below is a synthesis of the most widely cited evidence, organized by the main channels through which QE reaches the real economy and by the groups that are most directly affected.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main transmission channels and the groups they touch  \n\n| Channel | How it works | Primary beneficiaries (or losers) | Representative empirical evidence |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **1\u2011a. Lower short\u2011term interest rates** (via the \u201cFed funds\u201d or \u201cpolicy\u201d rate falling as the central bank buys bonds) | Reduces the cost of borrowing for households (mortgages, auto loans, credit cards) and firms (investment loans, revolving credit). | \u2022 **Borrowers** \u2013 especially mortgage\u2011owners, small\u2011business owners, and firms with high leverage. <br>\u2022 **Savers** \u2013 experience lower yields on bank deposits, Treasury bills, and short\u2011term corporate paper. | \u2022 Federal Reserve \u201cLarge\u2011Scale Asset Purchase\u201d (LSAP) studies (e.g., Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack 2011) find a 100\u2011basis\u2011point decline in Treasury yields, cutting mortgage rates by ~30\u201340\u202fbps. <br>\u2022 The European Central Bank (ECB) \u201cCorporate Sector Purchase Programme\u201d (CSPP) lowered euro\u2011area corporate bond yields by 30\u201360\u202fbps (ECB 2020). |\n| **1\u2011b. Portfolio\u2011rebalancing (or \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d)** | As the central bank removes safe assets from the market, investors shift into riskier assets\u2014equities, corporate bonds, real estate, high\u2011yield debt\u2014pushing up their prices. | \u2022 **Asset\u2011owners** (high\u2011net\u2011worth households, pension funds, insurers) see a rise in wealth. <br>\u2022 **Renters and low\u2011net\u2011worth households** gain little directly; they may benefit indirectly if higher asset prices stimulate consumption. | \u2022 Bernanke, Gertler & Gilchrist (1999) estimate a 0.5\u20131\u202f% increase in equity prices for each 100\u2011bps fall in long\u2011term yields. <br>\u2022 The IMF (2021) notes that QE in the United States (2009\u20112014) raised the S&P\u202f500 by about 40\u202f% relative to a no\u2011QE counterfactual, disproportionately benefiting the top 10\u202f% of wealth holders. |\n| **1\u2011c. Exchange\u2011rate depreciation** (when QE is more aggressive than abroad) | Lower domestic yields make the currency less attractive, weakening the exchange rate. | \u2022 **Export\u2011oriented firms** and workers in export sectors benefit from a price advantage abroad. <br>\u2022 **Import\u2011competing firms and low\u2011income households** face higher import prices, potentially eroding real wages. | \u2022 Gagnon",

The transmission to mortgage rates  \n\n- **Mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS)** are the primary vehicle through which the Fed\u2019s purchases affect home\u2011loan rates.  \n- When the Fed buys MBS, the price of those securities rises and their yield falls.  \n- The **30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgage** is priced off the yield of *benchmark* MBS plus a small spread (the \u201crisk premium\u201d).  \n\n**Empirical rule of thumb (from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\u202fLouis, 2014):**  \n> A 1\u2011percentage\u2011point (100\u2011bp) fall in the 10\u2011year Treasury yield translates into roughly a **0.6\u2011percentage\u2011point (60\u2011bp) drop in the 30\u2011year fixed mortgage rate**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

      "unknown_model_response": "## The Portfolio\u2011Rebalancing (or \u201cWealth\u2011Effect\u201d) Channel of QE  \n\n### 1. What the term means  \n\nWhen a central bank runs a **quantitative\u2011easing (QE) programme** it **purchases large quantities of safe, highly\u2011liquid assets** (government bonds, agency mortgage\u2011backed securities, sometimes high\u2011grade corporate bonds).  \n\n1. **Supply side:** Those securities disappear from the private market.  \n2. **Demand side:** The buyers of those securities are *not* private investors; they are the central bank, which pays for the assets by **crediting the reserve accounts of commercial banks** (or, in the case of non\u2011bank sellers, by wiring funds to their settlement accounts).  \n\nBecause the **total amount of safe assets in the market falls while the amount of money in the system rises**, investors who previously held those safe assets must **re\u2011allocate the cash they receive** into other places. This re\u2011allocation is what economists call **portfolio rebalancing**.\n\n| Step | What happens in the market | Why it matters for asset prices |\n|------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **A. Central bank buys bonds** | Private holders (banks, pension funds, insurance companies, money\u2011market funds, households) sell bonds and receive cash (or reserves). | The supply of those bonds contracts, pushing their price up and their yield down. |\n| **B. Sellers now have excess cash** | They look for assets that still offer a higher expected return than the near\u2011zero yield on the newly created cash. | The **relative attractiveness** of riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, REITs, high\u2011yield bonds, real estate) rises. |\n| **C. Buying pressure on riskier assets** | Market participants purchase those assets, driving up their prices and lowering their yields. | Higher prices \u2192 higher *wealth* for owners of those assets, and lower borrowing costs for firms that issue them. |\n\nThe process is **self\u2011reinforcing**: higher equity prices raise portfolio values, which can encourage further buying (the \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d on consumption) and also improve firms\u2019 balance sheets, making it cheaper for them to issue more debt or equity, which again lifts asset prices.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
