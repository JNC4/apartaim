It is carried out by the developers of the product, reviewed by independent experts, and overseen by national and international regulatory agencies.  Below is a roadmap of the most widely used framework, together with the evidence that supports each step and the points that remain debated.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The information comes from the original safety dossiers submitted to the FDA (1998) and EFSA (1998\u20112023), the peer\u2011reviewed literature (e.g.,\u00a0Romeis\u202fet\u202fal., 2008;\u00a0Baker\u202fet\u202fal., 2015), and the Codex Alimentarius guidance documents.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Production of a \u201ctest\u2011grade\u201d Cry1\u202fAb protein\n\n| Why it matters | How it is done |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Toxicology tests require a **high\u2011purity, well\u2011characterised protein** that is *identical* to the one produced in the plant. | \u2022 The *cry1Ab* gene is cloned into an *E.\u202fcoli* expression vector. <br>\u2022 The protein is produced in a fermenter, purified by chromatography, and then **checked for**:<br>\u2003\u2013 Amino\u2011acid sequence (mass spectrometry, N\u2011terminal sequencing).<br>\u2003\u2013 Purity (>95\u202f% by SDS\u2011PAGE and HPLC).<br>\u2003\u2013 Absence of endotoxin (<0.1\u202fEU\u202f\u00b5g\u207b\u00b9).<br>\u2003\u2013 Correct folding (circular dichroism, activity assay against *Ostrinia nubilalis* larvae). |\n| The test\u2011grade protein is stored at \u201380\u202f\u00b0C in a buffer that mimics plant tissue (pH\u202f7.0, 150\u202fmM NaCl). | This ensures that the protein used in all assays is **stable** and **reproducible**. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  **Acute Oral Toxicity** (single\u2011dose)\n\n| Feature | Typical protocol (OECD TG\u202f425/426) | Cry1\u202fAb data |\n|---------|------------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Species** | Mice (CD\u20111 or Swiss) \u2013 both sexes, 5\u20136\u202fweeks old. | 5\u202fg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 body weight (\u22485\u202f\u00d7\u202fthe estimated human exposure) administered by gavage. |\n| **Dose** | Up to the limit test of 5\u202fg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 (the highest practical dose). | No mortality, no clinical signs, no body\u2011weight loss over 14\u202fdays. |\n| **Interpretation** | If the LD\u2085\u2080 > 5\u202fg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9, the substance is considered **practically non\u2011toxic**. | Cry1\u202fAb showed **no acute toxicity**; the LD\u2085\u2080 is therefore >5\u202fg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9, far above any realistic dietary exposure (\u22480.1\u202fmg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 per day for a high\u2011consumption adult). |\n\n> **Key point:** The protein is a *large, water\u2011soluble* protein that is not absorbed intact from the gut, so systemic toxicity is unlikely.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  **Sub\u2011chronic (90\u2011day) Oral Toxicity** in rodents\n\n| Parameter | Standard OECD TG\u202f408 (90\u2011day) | Cry1\u202fAb study details |\n|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Species** | Rats (Sprague\u2011Dawley), both sexes, 6\u20138\u202fweeks old at start. | 3 dose groups + control (0, 100, 300, 1000",
