      "user_message": "How does the death penalty compare to life imprisonment in terms of actually preventing or deterring serious crimes?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  The bulk of rigorous research finds **no reliable evidence that the death penalty deters homicide or other serious violent crimes any more than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole**.  The strongest predictors of lower homicide rates are the *certainty* and *speed* of punishment, not whether the ultimate penalty is death or life.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the main bodies of evidence, the methodological reasons why the question is hard to answer, and the points that most scholars agree on.  References are given in brackets; you can look up the original papers or the many literature reviews that cite them.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The Views of Leading Criminologists\u201d (survey) | Survey of 1,000 criminologists | 88\u202f% said there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of a deterrent effect | Confirms the expert consensus. |\n| **International cross\u2011national comparisons** (e.g., United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 2019) | Compare homicide rates in countries with/without capital punishment, controlling for GDP, policing, gun prevalence | No systematic link; many abolitionist countries (e.g., Canada, most of Europe) have homicide rates *lower* than U.S. states that retain the death penalty. | Recognized as illustrative but limited by cultural and legal heterogeneity. |\n| **Specific\u2011case studies** (e.g., murder of police officers) | Some state\u2011level analyses find a modest reduction after a \u201chigh\u2011profile\u201d execution | Effect is small, short\u2011lived, and not replicated for ordinary homicides. | Treated as a niche finding, not generalizable. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Across the most methodologically sound studies, the estimated effect of the death penalty on homicide deterrence ranges from *zero* to",
