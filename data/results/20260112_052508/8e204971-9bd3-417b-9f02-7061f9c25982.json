      "unknown_model_response": "## Overview  \n\nEconomic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that aim to coerce a target state (or non\u2011state actor) into changing a specific behavior without resorting to armed conflict.  Whether they \u201csucceed\u201d depends on a **combination of political, economic, and strategic factors**\u2014both on the side imposing the sanctions (the \u201csender\u201d) and on the side being sanctioned (the \u201ctarget\u201d).  Scholars have studied hundreds of cases since the 1970s, and a modest but growing body of quantitative research now points to a few variables that consistently raise the odds of success, while other variables make success unlikely or ambiguous.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the **strongest evidence and arguments from all sides**, a statement of where the academic consensus lies, a note on the **remaining uncertainties**, and an explanation of why scholars and policymakers sometimes reach very different conclusions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201csuccess\u201d means \u2013 the first source of disagreement  \n\n| Definition used by researchers | Typical measurement | Why it matters |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| **Policy change** (the specific demand is met) | Binary coding of whether the target altered the targeted behavior within a set time\u2011frame (e.g., stopped nuclear tests, released political prisoners) | Most policy\u2011oriented studies use this; it is the clearest, but often the hardest outcome to attribute solely to sanctions. |\n| **Behavioral concession** (partial compliance or negotiation) | Number of concessions, diplomatic signals, or willingness to enter talks | Allows detection of \u201cpartial wins\u201d but can be subjective. |\n| **Regime survival / durability** | Whether the target regime stays in power | Frequently used by security\u2011studies scholars; can conflate sanctions with other internal dynamics. |\n| **Economic impact** (GDP loss, inflation, etc.) | Macro\u2011economic indicators | Useful for cost\u2011benefit analysis, but economic pain does not automatically translate into policy change. |\n\n**Consensus:**  Most quantitative meta\u2011analyses (e.g., Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott 2009; Pape 1997; Drezner 2011) treat **policy change** as the primary outcome.  However, many practitioners argue that \u201csuccess\u201d may also include **signalling** or \u201craising the political cost\u201d of the undesired behavior, even if the target does not fully comply.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Factors that Increase the Likelihood of Success  \n\n### 2.1. **International Unity and Multilateral Enforcement**  \n\n| Evidence | Mechanism |\n|----------|-----------|\n| **Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal. (2009)** find that sanctions imposed by a coalition of three or more major powers are **twice as likely** to achieve their objectives as unilateral sanctions. | Greater economic reach, reduced opportunities for the target to find alternative markets, and higher political cost for evasion. |\n| **Kaempfer & Lowenberg (2020)** show that United Nations sanctions with Chapter\u202fVII backing have a success rate of ~55\u202f% versus ~30\u202f% for purely national measures. | Legal legitimacy and the threat of collective enforcement (e.g., naval blockades) raise compliance incentives. |\n| **Case studies** (e.g., South Africa\u2019s apartheid sanctions, Iran nuclear sanctions) illustrate that **broad participation** makes it harder for the target to substitute trade partners. |  |\n\n**Key nuance:**  Unity matters **more** when the target is economically integrated with the sanctioning coalition.  If the target can pivot to non\u2011aligned partners (e.g., Russia turning to China, Iran to Turkey), the marginal benefit of multilateralism declines.\n\n### 2.2. **Target\u2019s Economic Vulnerability / Dependence on Sanctioning Countries**  \n\n| Evidence | Mechanism |\n|----------|-----------|\n| **Pape (1997)** argues that sanctions are most effective when the target **depends heavily on the sanctioning state\u2019s trade** (especially for oil, food, finance). | Loss of critical imports/exports creates tangible pain that can force policy change. |\n| **Drezner (2011)**, using a dataset of 221 sanctions episodes, finds that **energy\u2011rich autocracies** (e.g., Iran pre\u20112015) are *less* responsive because they can fund the regime with natural\u2011resource revenues. | High\u2011value export commodities can \u201cfinance\u201d sanction evasion. |\n| **Empirical note**:  Small, export\u2011oriented economies (e.g., North Korea) have shown high elasticity to sanctions",
