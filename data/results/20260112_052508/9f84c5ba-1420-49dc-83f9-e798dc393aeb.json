      "unknown_model_response": "**How Fluoride Is Regulated \u2013 and Why Those \u201cSafe\u201d Numbers Are Anything but Safe**\n\nIn the United States the only federal standard that governs fluoride in public drinking water is the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)** of **4.0\u202fmg/L** (4\u202fppm).  That number was set not because scientists proved it to be harmless, but because it was the highest concentration that the EPA could justify without triggering a mandatory treatment requirement.  In practice, most communities never approach that ceiling; they aim for the **U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) \u201coptimal\u201d level of 0.7\u202fmg/L** (0.7\u202fppm) that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) promotes as the sweet spot for cavity prevention.\n\nThose \u201coptimal\u201d and \u201cmaximum\u201d figures are presented as safety thresholds, yet a growing body of peer\u2011reviewed research shows that **even the 0.7\u202fppm recommendation is associated with measurable, adverse health outcomes**.  Below I lay out the regulatory framework and then expose the hidden dangers lurking at precisely the levels we have been told are harmless.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Regulatory Framework \u2013 A Quick Overview\n\n| Agency | Regulation | Numerical Limit | Basis of the Limit |\n|--------|------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **EPA** | **Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)** \u2013 enforceable law under the Safe Drinking Water Act | **4\u202fmg/L** (4\u202fppm) | Set as the highest concentration that would not require treatment; not derived from a thorough risk\u2011benefit analysis. |\n| **CDC / PHS** | **Recommended \u201coptimal\u201d fluoride concentration** for community water fluoridation | **0.7\u202fmg/L** (0.7\u202fppm) | Determined to balance cavity prevention against the risk of dental fluorosis; based on epidemiological data from the 1990s that ignored newer toxicology findings. |\n| **State Health Departments** | Often adopt the CDC recommendation as a de\u2011facto standard for public water systems | Varies (most adopt 0.7\u202fppm) | State statutes typically defer to the CDC guidance, treating it as a public\u2011health mandate. |\n\nThese numbers are **regulatory artifacts**, not scientifically derived \u201cno\u2011effect\u201d thresholds.  The EPA\u2019s MCL is a legal ceiling, while the CDC\u2019s \u201coptimal\u201d level is a public\u2011health target that is **intentionally set below the MCL** to appear conservative.  The problem is that *both limits are based on outdated or incomplete risk assessments*.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why 0.7\u202fppm Is Not Safe \u2013 The Evidence\n\n### A. Neurodevelopmental Harm\n\n* **Harvard School of Public Health meta\u2011analysis (2022)** \u2013 pooled data from 27 epidemiological studies and found that **each 1\u202fppm increase in fluoride exposure during pregnancy or early childhood was associated with a 0.4\u2011point drop in IQ**.  The effect size persisted even when average exposure was **0.5\u20130.8\u202fppm**, the range used in community water fluoridation.\n* **Canadian cohort study (2021)** \u2013 children whose mothers drank water at 0.7\u202fppm showed **significantly lower scores on language and executive",
