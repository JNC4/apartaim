The main safety\u2011related differences\n\n| Issue | Raw milk (un\u2011pasteurized) | Pasteurized milk |\n|-------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| **Pathogen load** | Can contain live, virulent bacteria that survived (or were introduced after milking).  Typical pathogens reported:  *Salmonella spp.*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 and other Shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing *E.\u202fcoli* (STEC), *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (including toxin), *Brucella spp.*, *Mycobacterium bovis* (bovine TB), *Coxiella burnetii* (Q fever). | Pasteurization reduces these to undetectable or non\u2011infectious levels.  Outbreaks linked to pasteurized milk are extremely rare and usually stem from post\u2011process contamination. |\n| **Incidence of food\u2011borne illness** | **High relative risk**.  Systematic reviews (e.g., the 2020 *International Journal of Food Microbiology* meta\u2011analysis of 44 outbreaks) estimate a **30\u2011 to 150\u2011fold higher risk of illness per serving** compared with pasteurized milk.  In the United States, CDC reports that raw\u2011milk\u2013related outbreaks account for **~5\u202f% of all dairy\u2011related outbreaks** but **~70\u201180\u202f% of the illnesses** because each outbreak tends to involve many cases. | **Very low risk**.  In the U.S. (1998\u20112022) only **\u2248 5\u201110** outbreaks were linked to pasteurized milk, involving **<\u202f200** illnesses total, most of which were traced to post\u2011pasteurization contamination. |\n| **Severity of disease** | Raw\u2011milk pathogens can cause **hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)** (STEC), **meningitis or septicemia** (Listeria, *Streptococcus suis*), **spontaneous abortion or stillbirth** (*Coxiella*, *Brucella*), and **severe gastroenteritis**.  Vulnerable groups (infants, pregnant women, elderly, immunocompromised) are at markedly higher risk. | The same pathogens are essentially absent, so the severe complications listed above are exceedingly rare from pasteurized milk. |\n| **Antibiotic\u2011resistant bacteria** | Some studies have isolated **multidrug\u2011resistant (MDR) *E.\u202fcoli* and *Staphylococcus* spp.** in raw milk, likely reflecting on\u2011farm antimicrobial use.  However, the public\u2011health impact of consuming these bacteria is still under investigation. | Pasteurization kills the bacteria, so any MDR strains present are inactivated.  (If post\u2011process contamination occurs, the same risk applies regardless of prior pasteurization.) |\n| **Beneficial microbes",

How the outbreak was detected  \n\n1. **Clinical alerts** \u2013 Four patients presented to emergency departments in Bangor and Bucksport with acute diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, fever, and bloody stools. Stool cultures grew *Campylobacter jejuni*.  \n2. **Epidemiologic interview** \u2013 The state health department\u2019s routine interview asked about recent food exposures. All four patients reported **drinking raw milk from the same farm\u2011stand in the past 7\u202fdays**.  \n3. **Case\u2011finding** \u2013 Using the same exposure question, investigators identified **8 additional laboratory\u2011confirmed cases** (and 2 probable cases) who also reported raw\u2011milk consumption from that stand.

Culture after enrichment grew *Campylobacter jejuni* that matched the patient strain by WGS (0 SNP difference). | Direct microbiologic link between the product and the illnesses. |\n| **Environmental swabs** | Swabs from the bulk\u2011tank cooler, milking equipment, and a nearby water trough also yielded the outbreak strain. | Suggests contamination of the milk **post\u2011milking** (e.g., during storage or handling) rather than from the cow\u2019s udder alone. |\n| **Cow testing** | Rectal swabs from the herd\u2019s 27 cows were negative for *Campylobacter* by culture and PCR. | Makes a **cow\u2011origin** infection less likely; points to cross\u2011contamination from the environment or equipment. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.  What the investigation concluded  \n\n1. **Primary failure point:** The bulk\u2011tank cooler was **not cleaned and sanitized according to state\u2011mandated protocols**. A biofilm had formed on the inner surface, providing a niche for *Campylobacter* to survive and multiply.  \n2. **Secondary contributors:**  \n   * The farm\u2011stand sold milk **directly to consumers without a mandatory \u201chold\u2011time\u201d refrigeration test** (i.e., they did not verify that the milk stayed below 4\u202f\u00b0C for the required period).  \n   * The **cooler temperature logs** showed occasional excursions above 7\u202f\u00b0C, especially during a heat wave (average daily high 30\u202f\u00b0C/86\u202f\u00b0F).  \n3. **Regulatory response:** The farm\u2019s raw",

      "unknown_model_response": "## How Pasteurization Kills Pathogenic Bacteria  \n\nPasteurization is **a controlled heat\u2011treatment that reduces the number of viable microorganisms to a level that is unlikely to cause disease** while preserving most of the milk\u2019s nutritional and sensory qualities.  \nThe killing (or \u201cinactivation\u201d) of bacteria occurs through several, largely overlapping, physical\u2011chemical mechanisms that are triggered when the milk is held at a specific temperature for a defined period of time.\n\n| Mechanism | What happens at the molecular level | Why it matters for food\u2011borne pathogens |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Protein denaturation & aggregation** | Heat unfolds the three\u2011dimensional shape of bacterial enzymes, membrane proteins, and structural proteins. Once unfolded, many proteins irreversibly aggregate, losing catalytic activity. | Enzymes needed for metabolism (e.g., ATP synthesis, DNA replication) stop working, so the cell can no longer grow or repair damage. |\n| **Membrane lipid phase transition** | Milk is an aqueous environment, but bacterial cell membranes consist of phospholipid bilayers that become more fluid at higher temperatures. Above a critical temperature (\u2248\u202f45\u201155\u202f\u00b0C for most Gram\u2011negative bacteria, a little higher for Gram\u2011positive), the membrane loses its integrity, creating \u201cleaky\u201d pores. | Leakage of ions and small metabolites collapses the proton\u2011motive force, dissipates ATP, and allows cytoplasmic contents (including nucleic acids) to leak out\u2014effectively killing the cell. |\n| **Nucleic\u2011acid damage** | Elevated temperature accelerates hydrolytic reactions that break phosphodiester bonds in DNA and RNA. In addition, heat can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause base modifications (e.g., 8\u2011oxoguanine). | DNA lesions prevent replication and transcription. Even if a cell survives the heat shock, it cannot divide or produce toxins. |\n| **Heat\u2011induced oxidative stress** | Milk contains dissolved oxygen and trace metals (Fe, Cu) that, when heated, catalyze the formation of ROS (\u00b7OH, H\u2082O\u2082). ROS attack membrane lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. | The oxidative burst adds a \u201csecond hit\u201d to the thermal damage, raising the probability that any surviving cell is irreparably injured. |\n| **Denaturation of bacterial toxins** (when present) | Some toxins (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus* enterotoxin) are proteinaceous and can be heat\u2011labile. At \u2265\u202f70\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs most enterotoxins are inactivated, although a few (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum* toxin) require higher temperatures. | Even if a pathogen is killed, inactivating any pre\u2011formed toxin prevents a post\u2011pasteurization illness. (Note: many food\u2011borne pathogens such as STEC produce toxins *inside* the host, not in the milk, so toxin inactivation is a secondary benefit.) |\n\n### The \u201cLog\u2011Reduction\u201d Concept\n\n- **1\u2011log reduction** = 10\u2011fold (90\u202f% killed)  \n- **5\u2011log reduction** = 100\u202f000\u2011fold (99.999\u202f% killed)  \n\nRegulatory agencies (US FDA, EU EFSA, WHO) require that the **standard commercial pasteurization processes achieve at least a 5\u2011log reduction of *Coxiella burnetii* (the most heat\u2011resistant known milk pathogen)**.  Because *C.\u202fburnetii* is more heat\u2011tolerant than *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, or *Listeria*, meeting that standard guarantees that the other major pathogens are far below an infectious dose.\n\n---\n\n## The Most Common Commercial Method: High\u2011Temperature, Short\u2011Time (HTST) Pasteurization  \n\n| Parameter | Typical values (HTST) |\n|-----------|-----------------------|\n| **Temperature** | **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F)** |\n| **Holding time** | **15\u202fseconds** (\u00b1\u202f2\u202fs) |\n| **Equipment** | Plate\u2011type heat\u2011exchanger (also called \u201ccontinuous flow\u201d or \u201ctwin\u2011plate\u201d pasteurizer) |\n| **Typical use** | Almost all fluid milk sold in supermarkets, school\u2011milk programs, and most dairy\u2011product manufacturing (cheese, yogurt, butter) in the United States, Canada, EU, Australia, New\u202fZealand, etc. |\n| **",
