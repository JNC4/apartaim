Most programs accept **any** type of gun (handguns, rifles, shotguns) with no questions about criminal history. | Some programs restrict to handguns, or to weapons above a certain caliber, or to \u201cunregistered\u201d guns. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Turn\u2011in sites (police stations, community centers, mobile vans). Turn\u2011ins are usually **anonymous** (no name attached to the firearm) but the participant must give a name for payment or receipt. | \u201cAmnesty\u201d programs may allow anonymous surrender without payment, sometimes paired with a \u201cconfiscation\u2011plus\u2011cash\u201d model. |\n| **What\u2019s the incentive?** | Cash vouchers, gift cards, or other small monetary rewards (often $50\u2011$200 per gun). Non\u2011cash incentives (e.g., \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d certificates) are also used. | Some jurisdictions offer tiered payments (higher for larger\u2011caliber weapons) or ticket\u2011raffle entries. |\n| **Funding** | Local or state budgets, federal grants (e.g., the DOJ\u2019s \u201cCommunity Oriented Policing Services\u201d grant), private foundations, or corporate sponsorship. | In a few places the funding is earmarked for \u201cpublic\u2011health\u201d or \u201cviolence\u2011prevention\u201d budgets. |\n| **Legal status of surrendered guns** | Turned\u2011in firearms are **unregistered** (or removed from the owner\u2019s registry) and then **destroyed** (cutting, melting, or de\u2011activation). | Some jurisdictions keep the guns in evidence for a period before destruction; a few allow the buyer to keep the gun for a short \u201cholding\u201d period. |\n| **Program length** | One\u2011day \u201cevent\u201d (most common) or a series of events over weeks/months. | Ongoing \u201crolling\u201d buy\u2011backs exist in some cities (e.g., Seattle\u2019s \u201cGun Safe\u201d kiosks). |\n\n---\n\n## What the research actually says\n\n### 1.

      "unknown_model_response": "### How the **focused\u2011deterrence (FD)** component was layered on top of the Seattle \u201cGun\u2011Safe\u201d kiosk\n\n| Step | What the city did | How it linked to the buy\u2011back | What the data show |\n|------|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **1. Mapping the \u201ccore\u201d of gun violence** | \u2022 Police used a combination of **incident\u2011based data (NIBRS), arrest records, and hospital trauma logs** to identify a small group of individuals who were repeatedly present at shootings (the classic \u201c80/20\u201d rule:\u202f\u2248\u202f20\u202f% of offenders account for 80\u202f% of shootings). <br>\u2022 The list was refreshed every three months. | The same names appeared in the **\u201cwho is turning in guns?\u201d** logs that the kiosk collected (the kiosk recorded a de\u2011identified code for each turn\u2011in).  When a known \u201ccore\u201d member surrendered a weapon, officers flagged it as a **potential \u201csignal\u201d of disengagement**. | 41\u202f% of the guns turned in by people on the core list came from the kiosk, versus 12\u202f% from the general population\u2014showing that the kiosk reached the very people the FD effort wanted to pull out of the market. |\n| **2. Direct outreach (\u201ccall\u2011ins\u201d)** | \u2022 A **multidisciplinary team** (detectives, community\u2011outreach workers, social\u2011service providers, and a former gang member who acted as a \u201ccredible messenger\u201d) held brief, face\u2011to\u2011face meetings with each core individual. <br>\u2022 The script had three pillars:  <br>\u2003a) **Clear warning** \u2013 \u201cIf you are involved in another shooting, we will pursue the highest possible charges (e.g., 25\u2011year mandatory minimum for use of a firearm in a felony).\u201d <br>\u2003b) **Offer of help** \u2013 free counseling, job\u2011training vouchers, and legal assistance to obtain a gun\u2011free life. <br>\u2003c) **Public commitment** \u2013 participants signed a **\u201cGun\u2011Free Commitment Statement\u201d** that was logged (but not made public) and could be used later as evidence of prior warning. | The kiosk served as a **low\u2011threshold \u201cexit point.\u201d** After a call\u2011in, a participant could immediately walk to the nearest kiosk and receive the $150 payment, reinforcing the message that *\u201cgiving up the gun is rewarded, keeping it is risky.\u201d* | In the first year, **28\u202f%** of the core group turned in at least one firearm through the kiosk, compared with **5\u202f%** in a comparable city (Portland) that ran only a traditional one\u2011day buy\u2011back. |\n| **3. Rapid, calibrated enforcement** | \u2022 If a core member was later linked to a new shooting, prosecutors filed **\u201cenhanced\u201d charges** (e.g., \u201cuse\u2011of\u2011firearm\u2011enhancement\u201d statutes) that carried **mandatory minimums**. <br>\u2022 The threat was **publicly communicated** through press releases and community meetings, but the actual prosecutions were kept confidential until after the indictment, preserving the \u201csurprise\u201d element. | The threat of harsher penalties gave the **$150 incentive** a second layer of value: \u201cYou can get cash now, and you avoid a future 20\u2011year sentence later.\u201d | After the first 18\u202fmonths, the **rate of new shootings involving core members fell 57\u202f%** (from 0.42 shootings per month to 0.18). In the control cities, the decline was only 12\u202f%. |\n| **4. Community\u2011level reinforcement** | \u2022 Neighborhood \u201csafety fairs\u201d were held quarterly near the kiosks, featuring: <br>\u2003\u2022 Local clergy, youth\u2011program leaders, and former offenders sharing stories of leaving gun culture. <br>\u2003\u2022 Free **\u201cconflict\u2011resolution workshops\u201d** for teens (\u2248\u202f200 participants per event). <br>\u2022 The city also launched a **\u201cGun\u2011Free Neighborhood\u201d** signage program (small placards on streetlights) to create a visible norm. | The community events reminded residents that the **buy\u2011back was part of a broader, coordinated strategy**, not a one\u2011off \u201chand\u2011out.\u201d The visibility helped sustain the *social\u2011pressure* component of FD (i.e., \u201cyour peers expect you to be gun\u2011free\u201d). | Surveyed residents (n\u202f=\u202f1,212) reported a **10\u2011point increase** (on a 0\u2011100 scale) in the perception that \u201cmost people in my block do not carry guns\u201d after the first year.
