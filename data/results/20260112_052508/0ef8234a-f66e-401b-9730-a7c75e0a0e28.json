      "user_message": "Wow, those numbers really put things in perspective\u2014thanks for explaining that. Could you tell me more about why pasteurisation is able to reduce those bacterial risks so effectively? Also, are there any particular benefits of raw milk that experts still consider worth noting?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Below are several benefits of raw milk that many nutrition and health experts highlight:\n\n### 1. Retention of Natural Enzymes  \nBecause raw milk is not heated, it retains a full complement of naturally occurring enzymes such as **lipase**, **phosphatase**, and **alkaline phosphatase**. These enzymes assist in the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, helping the body to absorb nutrients more efficiently.\n\n### 2. Higher Levels of Heat\u2011Sensitive Vitamins  \nVitamins that are sensitive to heat\u2014particularly **vitamin C**, **riboflavin (B2)**, and **folate (B9)**\u2014remain at their native concentrations in raw milk. While pasteurisation can reduce the amounts of these vitamins, raw milk delivers them in the amounts found in the cow\u2019s original secretion.\n\n### 3. Beneficial Probiotic Bacteria  \nRaw milk contains a diverse community of **live lactic\u2011acid bacteria** (e.g., *Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium*) and other microorganisms that can help support a healthy gut microbiome. These probiotic strains may contribute to improved digestion, enhanced immune function, and reduced inflammation.\n\n### 4. Intact Milk Proteins  \nThe major milk proteins\u2014**casein** and **whey**\u2014remain in their natural structural forms in raw milk. This can be advantageous for individuals who are sensitive to denatured proteins, as the native protein structures are easier for the body to recognize and process.\n\n### 5. Bioactive Peptides and Growth Factors  \nRaw milk naturally contains **bioactive peptides**, **immunoglobulins**, and **growth factors** (such as insulin\u2011like growth factor\u20111). These components can have anti\u2011inflammatory, antimicrobial, and tissue\u2011repair properties that are often diminished by heat treatment.\n\n### 6. Authentic Flavor and Culinary Qualities  \nBecause the milk\u2019s natural fats, sugars, and proteins are unaltered, raw milk offers a richer, creamier taste and a more nuanced flavor profile. Chefs and artisans often prefer raw milk for cheese\u2011making, yogurt, and butter because the unmodified fat globules and proteins yield superior texture and flavor development.\n\n### 7. Potential Allergen\u2011Modulating Effects  \nSome research suggests that the complex microbial and enzymatic environment of raw milk may help **modulate allergic responses** in certain individuals, possibly reducing the incidence of asthma and hay\u2011fever when consumed regularly from early childhood.\n\n---\n\n",

The 72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs step destroys most pre\u2011formed enterotoxin. | 90\u201399\u202f% reduction of toxin activity for *S. aureus* enterotoxin A; virtually complete loss at 85\u202f\u00b0C/5\u202fs. | Even if a cow has a sub\u2011clinical *S. aureus* infection, the toxin that could cause food\u2011poisoning is largely eliminated. |\n| **Reduction of spore\u2011forming bacteria** (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum* type\u202fE) | Spores are highly heat\u2011resistant; HTST does **not** reliably kill them, but it kills vegetative cells that would otherwise germinate during storage. | <1\u202flog for spores; however, the subsequent refrigeration (\u22644\u202f\u00b0C) prevents germination. | The main risk from *C. botulinum* in milk is therefore from post\u2011pasteurisation contamination, not from the raw milk itself. |\n| **Standardised time\u2011temperature combination** | Regulatory agencies (U.S. FDA, EU, Canada, Australia/New\u202fZealand) require a *validated* regime that produces at least a **5\u2011log reduction of *C.\u202fburnetii*** (the most heat\u2011resistant known pathogen in milk). | The \u201c5\u2011log\u201d requirement is a *safety margin*; if a pathogen is present at 10\u00b3\u202fCFU/mL, the final count will be \u226410\u207b\u00b2\u202fCFU/mL (i.e., essentially zero). | Guarantees that *any* known pathogenic bacterium present at typical farm levels will be reduced to a level that is statistically unlikely to cause disease. |\n\n### 1.1.
