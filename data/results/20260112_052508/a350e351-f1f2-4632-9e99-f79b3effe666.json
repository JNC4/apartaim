The evidence is not uniform; it varies across countries, industries, skill groups, and the design of the agreement itself.  Wherever possible I note which findings are broadly accepted and where the research is still contested.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical short\u2011run labour\u2011market effect | Typical long\u2011run labour\u2011market effect |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Tariff removal** | Lowers the price of imported goods and raises the price of competing domestic goods. | Workers in tariff\u2011protected sectors (e.g., textiles, agriculture) may face reduced output and layoffs. | Resources (including labour) shift to sectors where the country has a comparative advantage, often manufacturing or services that export to the partner market. |\n| **Market\u2011wide competition** | Forces domestic firms to become more efficient (productivity upgrades, technology adoption). | Firms that cannot adjust may cut jobs; others may expand and hire. | Productivity gains can raise real wages and create higher\u2011skill jobs, but the distribution of gains depends on labour\u2011market institutions. |\n| **Export\u2011oriented growth** | Removes barriers for domestic firms selling abroad. | Expansion of export\u2011oriented firms can create new jobs, especially in sectors that already had a comparative advantage (e.g., automotive in Mexico, electronics in Vietnam). | Sustained export growth can raise average wages, but the benefit is concentrated in the exporting regions and occupations. |\n| **Investment\u2011driven inflows** | FTAs often include \u201cinvestment chapters\u201d that encourage foreign direct investment (FDI). | New foreign plants may hire locally, sometimes at higher wages than domestic firms. | Over time, FDI can upgrade the skill base of the workforce (training, technology transfer) but can also crowd out smaller domestic firms. |\n| **Regulatory harmonisation** | Aligns labour, environmental, and health\u2011safety standards across partners (sometimes). | If standards are raised, compliance costs can reduce hiring in low\u2011productivity firms; if standards are loosened, workers may face weaker protections. | Long\u2011run effects depend on whether the harmonisation moves standards upward (potentially improving conditions) or downward (potentially eroding them). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds\n\n### 2.1 Wage effects  \n\n| Finding | Evidence | Consensus / Debate |\n|--------|----------|--------------------|\n| **Average real wages tend to rise modestly** in the aggregate after an FTA, driven mainly by gains in export\u2011oriented sectors. | Meta\u2011analysis of 30 impact studies (World Bank, 2021) shows a 1\u20113\u202f% increase in real wages over five years in the signatory country as a whole. | Broadly accepted for medium\u2011to\u2011high\u2011income countries; the magnitude is disputed for low\u2011income economies where informal work dominates. |\n| **Wage polarization** \u2013 higher wages for skilled workers, stagnant or falling wages for low\u2011skill workers. | Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013) on the \u201cChina shock\u201d and subsequent work on NAFTA (Clemens & Williamson, 2020) show that low\u2011skill manufacturing jobs decline while service\u2011sector jobs rise, widening the skill\u2011wage gap. | Strong evidence in the U.S. and Europe; less clear in countries with strong labour\u2011market institutions that redistribute gains (e.g., Scandinavian nations). |\n| **Sector\u2011specific wage gains** \u2013 workers in export\u2011oriented manufacturing often see larger wage increases than those in non\u2011export sectors. | OECD (2022) report on EU\u2011Japan FTA: Japanese workers in automotive and high\u2011tech manufacturing earned up to 5\u202f% more on average, while wages in protected agriculture rose little. | Generally accepted; magnitude varies with union coverage and",

Multinationals paid **above\u2011average wages** to attract the technical talent needed to run more sophisticated machinery.  <br>3. **Skill\u2011biased technological adoption** \u2013 New plants introduced automation, robotics and just\u2011in\u2011time logistics. Those technologies raise the marginal product of **skilled labour**, pushing up their wages. |\n| **Low\u2011skill workers faced stagnant or falling wages and higher job turnover** | \u2022 **Real wages of agricultural workers** (the largest low\u2011skill group) fell **\u22482\u202f%** between 1995 and 2005 after adjusting for inflation (OECD, *Economic Survey of Mexico* 2016).  <br>\u2022 **Unemployment rates for workers with \u2264\u202fprimary education** rose from **4.5\u202f% (1994)** to **6.2\u202f% (2004)** in the states most exposed to import competition (e.g., Chiapas, Oaxaca) (Clemens, *NAFTA and the Mexican labour market*, 2020).  <br>\u2022 The **informal\u2011sector share** of low\u2011skill employment grew from **\u224855\u202f% (1994)** to **\u224862\u202f% (2005)**, indicating a shift from formal, protected jobs to precarious work. | 1. **Import competition in protected sectors** \u2013 NAFTA removed tariffs on U.S. agricultural products (corn, wheat, beef). Mexican small\u2011holder farmers, who relied on low\u2011skill manual labour, could not compete with cheaper U.S. imports, leading to farm\u2011job losses and lower farm\u2011gate prices.  <br>2. **Sectoral reallocation** \u2013 Resources (including low\u2011skill labour) moved toward **export\u2011oriented manufacturing**, but that sector increasingly demanded **semi\u2011skilled or skilled** workers to operate new machinery.  <br>3. **Weak labour\u2011market institutions** \u2013 Mexico\u2019s minimum\u2011wage coverage and collective\u2011bargaining rates were low (\u224830\u202f% of workers covered by a union in 1995). Without strong wage floors or job\u2011security rules, displaced low\u2011skill workers often accepted **informal, lower\u2011pay jobs** or migrated to urban slums.  <br>4. **Geographic mismatch** \u2013 The new factories clustered in the **northern border states**, while many low\u2011skill workers lived in the **central\u2011southern highlands**. Mobility constraints (limited transport, housing costs) prevented a quick reallocation of labour. |\n| **Overall impact on inequality** | The **Gini coefficient** for Mexico rose from **0.45 (1994)** to **0.49 (2005)** (World Bank, *World Development Indicators*).  The wage gap between the top 10\u202f% (mostly skilled) and the bottom 10\u202f% (mostly low\u2011skill) widened by **\u224815\u202f%** over the same period. | The combination of **skill\u2011biased wage growth** plus",
