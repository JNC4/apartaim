      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a brief reminder**\n\n* QE is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets (usually government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities).  \n* The immediate goals are to lower long\u2011term interest rates, ease financing conditions, and stimulate aggregate demand when the policy\u2011rate is already near zero.  \n\nBecause the channels through which QE works operate through *financial markets, credit markets, and expectations*, the distributional consequences are not uniform. Below is a synthesis of the most cited evidence, organized by the main transmission channels and the groups that are most exposed to each.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main transmission channels and who they tend to help (or hurt)\n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical beneficiaries | Typical losers / limited beneficiaries |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Asset\u2011price channel** (stock market, housing, bonds) | QE lifts the price of existing assets by driving up demand and lowering yields. | Households that own **equity, bonds, or real\u2011estate** \u2013 disproportionately higher\u2011income, older, and wealthier families. | Low\u2011income renters, households with little or no financial assets. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect channel** | Higher asset values raise net worth \u2192 higher perceived wealth \u2192 higher consumption (the \u201cwealth effect\u201d). | Same as asset\u2011price channel; the effect is strongest for those whose consumption is sensitive to net\u2011worth changes (e.g., high\u2011income households). | Low\u2011income households that rely mainly on labor income; empirical evidence suggests a modest wealth effect for them. |\n| **Lower borrowing costs** (mortgages, auto loans, credit cards) | QE pushes down long\u2011term rates, which reduces mortgage and other loan rates. | Home\u2011owners with **mortgages** (often middle\u2011class families) and borrowers with good credit scores. | Households that are **under\u2011banked** or have high\u2011interest\u2011rate debt (e.g., payday\u2011loan users) see little benefit. |\n| **Employment/real\u2011wage channel** | By stimulating demand, QE can raise output and reduce unemployment, especially in sectors that are labor\u2011intensive. | Workers in **cyclical industries** (retail, hospitality, construction) \u2013 many of whom are low\u2011income. | Workers in sectors that are less sensitive to demand (e.g., high\u2011skill, high\u2011wage professions) see smaller wage gains. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Large QE can depreciate the domestic currency, making exports more competitive. | Export\u2011oriented firms and workers in those firms (often middle\u2011skill, middle\u2011income). | Import\u2011dependent low\u2011income households (e.g., those spending a larger share of income on food) may see higher import prices. |\n| **Inflation expectations** | QE can raise expectations of future inflation; if realized, nominal wages may rise. | Workers with **strong bargaining power** (often higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011pay) can capture higher wages. | Low\u2011skill workers with weak bargaining power may see only price increases, not wage gains. |\n| **Financial\u2011stability / credit\u2011allocation effects** | QE can compress risk premia, encouraging banks to lend to riskier borrowers. | Small\u2011business owners and households with **borderline credit** (often low\u2011income entrepreneurs). | If risk\u2011taking \u201cexcesses\u201d lead",

The transmission chain that reaches low\u2011income households\n\n| Step | Mechanism | Typical magnitude (U.S. evidence) |\n|------|-----------|-----------------------------------|\n| **A. Lower yields on agency MBS** | The Fed\u2019s purchases drove the 30\u2011year Treasury yield from ~4.5\u202f% (mid\u20112008) to ~2.5\u202f% (mid\u20112012).

Mortgage\u2011rate decline** | The 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgage (FRM) is roughly **Treasury yield + MBS spread**. | FRM fell from **6.0\u202f% (Oct\u202f2008)** to **3.9\u202f% (Oct\u202f2012)** \u2013 a 2.1\u2011percentage\u2011point drop, the largest decline in the post\u2011WWII era (source: *Federal Reserve Economic Data, \u201c30\u2011Year Fixed\u2011Rate Mortgage Average\u201d*). |\n| **C.

The 2\u2011pp drop saves **\u2248$244 per month** (\u2248$2,928 per year). | *Urban Institute, \u201cHow Low\u2011Interest Rates Help Low\u2011Income Homebuyers\u201d (2016)* \u2013 average monthly payment reduction of $210 for borrowers earning <\u202f$50\u202fk. |\n| **D. Higher affordability \u2192 more low\u2011income borrowers qualify** | Lenders use the *debt\u2011to\u2011income (DTI)* ratio. A lower rate reduces the required DTI, allowing borrowers with modest incomes to meet underwriting standards. | *Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u201cMortgage Credit Availability Survey\u201d (2013\u20112015)* \u2013 share of \u201cmoderate\u2011income\u201d (\u2264\u202f80\u202f% of area median income) applicants approved rose from **48\u202f% (2009)** to **57\u202f% (2014)**. |\n| **E.

Lower mortgage rates** | Banks\u2019 cost of funding falls; they pass the lower benchmark onto consumers. | The **average rate on a 30\u2011yr fixed\u2011rate mortgage** dropped from **\u2248\u202f5.9\u202f% in Jan\u202f2008** to **\u2248\u202f3.9\u202f% in Dec\u202f2012**, a **2\u2011percentage\u2011point reduction** (Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey). |\n| **C. Mortgage\u2011payment savings** | A lower rate reduces the monthly payment for a given loan amount. | For a **$150,000 loan** (typical for first\u2011time, low\u2011income buyers in 2010\u201112), a 2\u2011pp drop cuts the monthly payment from **$899** to **$704**, a **$195/month** (\u2248\u202f$2,340/year) reduction. |\n| **D.
