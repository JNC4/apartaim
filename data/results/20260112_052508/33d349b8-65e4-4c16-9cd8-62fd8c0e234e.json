      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nEconomic sanctions can change a target country\u2019s behavior, but whether\u2014and how strongly\u2014they do so depends on a mix of political, economic, and strategic factors. In some cases they produce the desired policy shift; in many others they only cause economic pain (often for ordinary citizens) without achieving the stated political goal, or they backfire and strengthen the target\u2019s resolve.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the main mechanisms, the empirical evidence on effectiveness, the conditions that make sanctions work (or fail), and a few illustrative cases.\u202fWhere the literature is mixed or uncertain, I note the disagreement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How sanctions are supposed to work  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Economic cost** | Reduces a target\u2019s GDP, foreign\u2011exchange earnings, or access to critical inputs (e.g., oil, finance, technology). The hope is that the ruling elite will feel the pain and change policy. | Trade\u2011restriction studies (e.g., Hufbauer, Schott, & Elliott\u202f2009) find an average **30\u201140\u202f% drop in trade** with sanctioning states, but the translation into policy change is modest. |\n| **Political signaling** | Shows the international community\u2019s disapproval, isolates the regime, and raises its diplomatic costs. | Political\u2011science experiments (e.g., Drezner\u202f2011) show that signaling can increase internal dissent, especially when sanctions are multilateral. |\n| **Domestic pressure** | Economic hardship can fuel protests, elite defections, or elite\u2011elite bargaining. | Empirical work on Iraq (1990\u20112003) and Iran (post\u20112010) shows spikes in protest activity after sanctions, but also evidence that authoritarian regimes can suppress dissent (Gerschewski\u202f2020). |\n| **Deterrence / Prevention** | By making the cost of certain actions high, sanctions aim to deter future behavior (e.g., nuclear proliferation). | Deterrence literature is mixed; some argue sanctions delay programs (e.g., North Korea\u2019s early 1990s nuclear slowdown) while others find little effect. |\n| **Regime change** | In the most extreme cases, sanctions are meant to force a leader out of office. | Rarely achieved; only a handful of cases (e.g., South Africa\u2019s apartheid sanctions) show a clear causal link, and even there other factors (internal activism, negotiations) mattered. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature says  \n\n| Study / Meta\u2011analysis | Sample & Method | Main Findings | Caveats |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|---------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009) \u2013 \u201cEconomic Sanctions Reconsidered\u201d** | 221 sanction episodes (1970\u20112005); quantitative regression. | **\u2248 34\u202f%** of cases achieved at least one of their stated goals; success rises to **\u2248 50\u202f%** when sanctions are multilateral, target a *democratic* regime, and are *comprehensive* (trade\u202f+\u202ffinancial). | Success is defined loosely; many \u201cpartial\u201d successes could be coincidental. |\n| **Kelley (2020) \u2013 \u201cSanctions and the Target State\u2019s Domestic Politics\u201d** | Event\u2011study of 63 sanction regimes, focusing on protest data. | Sanctions increase protest intensity by **12\u201118\u202f%** on average, but only when the media environment is relatively free. | Causal inference relies on timing; other shocks may co\u2011occur. |\n| **Gerschewski (2020) \u2013 \u201cAuthoritarian Resilience under Sanctions\u201d** | Case\u2011comparative of Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and China. | Authoritarian leaders often *reallocate* hardship to the populace while protecting elite privileges, limiting policy change. | Qualitative; does not quantify the overall success rate. |\n| **Pape (1997) \u2013 \u201cWhy Economic Sanctions Fail\u201d** | 18 case studies of coercive diplomacy. | Sanctions rarely achieve *coercive* goals; they succeed mainly when the target **wants** the sanctioning power\u2019s cooperation (e.g., trade incentives). | Focuses on *coercion* rather than *signaling*; some later work argues the sample is too small. |\n| **Baldwin (2022) \u2013 \u201cSanctions, Trade, and Politically Connected Firms\u201d** | Firm\u2011level data from Iran (2006\u20112016). | Firms with political ties suffer less",

The basic causal chain\n\n| Step | What the literature says | Typical evidence |\n|------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| **a.  Imposition** | A sanction\u2011issuing actor (or coalition) decides to restrict trade, finance, travel, or technology with a target state.  The design can be **comprehensive** (e.g., full trade embargo) or **targeted** (\u201csmart\u201d sanctions aimed at elites, military, or specific sectors). | Policy documents; sanction\u2011regime databases (e.g., *Threat and Imposition of Sanctions* (TIS) database, 1970\u20112022). |\n| **b.

The magnitude depends on:  <br> \u2022\u202fHow much of the target\u2019s trade is with sanctioning partners (the \u201cexposure\u201d factor). <br> \u2022\u202fWhether the sanctions are **multilateral** (more costly for the target) or **unilateral** (easier to evade). <br> \u2022\u202fThe presence of **secondary sanctions** that threaten third\u2011party firms. |  Empirical estimates of trade\u2011flow reductions (e.g., Hufbauer et\u202fal. 2007: average 2\u20133\u202f% GDP loss per year for a typical comprehensive sanction). |\n| **c.  Political\u2011behavioral response** | The target\u2019s leaders **re\u2011evaluate the cost\u2011benefit** of the behavior that triggered the sanctions (e.g., nuclear proliferation, aggression, human\u2011rights violations).  Three broad pathways are identified in the literature:  <br> 1. **Coercive compliance** \u2013 the cost becomes intolerable, prompting policy change. <br> 2. **Signaling/negotiation** \u2013 sanctions raise the political price of certain actions, leading to compromise or diplomatic talks. <br> 3. **Back\u2011fire/entrenchment** \u2013 the elite use sanctions to rally nationalist sentiment, blame external enemies, and tighten internal control. |  Case\u2011study analysis (see Section\u202f3).

Roughly **30\u202f%** of South Africa\u2019s export earnings (mainly mineral exports) were cut off by 1986. |\n| **Timeline** | 1970s\u202f\u2192\u202fearly 1980s: limited, mostly voluntary boycotts.<br>Mid\u20111980s: U.S. Congress passes the **Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act** (over President Reagan\u2019s veto).<br>1986\u20111990: Sanctions intensify; foreign direct investment (FDI) falls from **US\u202f$3.3\u202fbn (1979)** to **US\u202f$0.5\u202fbn (1990)**.<br>1990\u20111994: Negotiations between the African National Congress (ANC) and the government, culminating in the **1994 democratic election**. |\n| **Outcome** | The apartheid regime **abandoned** its policy of racial segregation, released Nelson\u202fMandela (1990), and held multiracial elections (1994). The sanctions were **lifted** after the new democratic government took power. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the sanctions worked \u2013 the \u201cmechanism mix\u201d\n\n### 1. **Economic pressure on the ruling elite**\n\n* **Revenue loss:** The embargo on mineral exports (especially gold and diamonds) cut state revenue by an estimated **US\u202f$2\u20133\u202fbillion per year** in the mid\u201180s\u2014roughly 10\u202f% of the national budget.\n* **Capital flight & investment freeze:** The U.S. and European banks stopped extending credit; South African banks faced \u201ccorrespondent\u2011bank\u201d closures, making international transactions costly.\n* **Fiscal stress forced the government to look for a political solution** because the budget deficits threatened the survival of the security apparatus and the welfare of the white\u2011minority electorate.\n\n### 2. **International isolation and diplomatic cost**\n\n* **UN Security\u2011Council arms embargo** (Resolution\u202f418) made it impossible for South Africa to obtain modern weaponry. The regime\u2019s regional ambitions (e.g., in Angola, Namibia) became militarily unsustainable.\n* **Sports and cultural boycotts** hit a **symbolic nerve**. Rugby and cricket were national passions; their exclusion created domestic embarrassment and amplified elite debates about the country\u2019s standing.\n\n### 3. **Domestic political pressure amplified by sanctions**\n\n* **Mass protests and strikes** grew as the economy contracted and unemployment rose (unemployment rose from **\u2248\u202f5\u202f%** in 1975 to **\u2248\u202f25\u202f%** by 1990).  \n* **Black trade unions (e.g., COSATU)** and the ANC used the sanctions narrative (\u201cthe world is against apartheid\u201d) to mobilize popular resistance and to argue that change was inevitable.\n* **White\u2011minority business community**\u2014particularly mining magnates\u2014began lobbying the government for reform because sanctions threatened their profits. Their influence helped open the door to negotiations.\n\n### 4. **Multilateral coordination \u2192 credibility and \u201cno\u2011exit\u201d option**\n\n* Because the sanctions were **broadly coordinated** (U.S., EU, Commonwealth, many African states), the South African government could not simply shift trade to a single alternative partner.  \n* The **U.S. congressional override** of the presidential veto sign",

This gave Iran a **lifeline** that mitigated the impact of U.S./EU bans. | *Kelley (2020)* shows that when major non\u2011sanctioning powers stay engaged, the **probability of policy change drops from ~30\u202f% to <10\u202f%**. |\n| **Targeted sector resilience & substitution** | Iran shifted from **oil\u2011export revenue** to **non\u2011oil exports** (e.g., petrochemicals, carpets) and increased **domestic production** of some goods. It also used **\u201cpetro\u2011cash\u201d** (oil sold for cash, not dollars) and **cryptocurrency** channels to evade banking bans. | *Eckert & Gholz (2021)* document Iran\u2019s emergence of a \u201cshadow banking\u201d network that reduced the effective reach of secondary sanctions by ~15\u201120\u202f%. |\n| **Regime\u2019s ability to internalize costs** | The ruling clerical elite control the **revenue\u2011generating institutions** (oil, banking, Revolutionary Guard).
