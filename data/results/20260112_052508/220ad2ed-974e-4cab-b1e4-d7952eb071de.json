All dissolve to release **fluoride ion (F\u207b)**, the biologically active species. |\n| **Why it is added** | Fluoride is a **naturally occurring trace element** in most ground\u2011water sources (0\u20132\u202fmg\u202fL\u207b\u00b9 in most US supplies). In many municipalities the natural level is below the range that has been shown to reduce cavities. Adding fluoride raises the concentration to a target \u201coptimal\u201d level. |\n| **How it is administered** | A small, precisely metered amount is injected into the water\u2011distribution system downstream of the treatment plant. The dose is calculated based on the average daily water consumption of the community (\u22481.5\u202fL\u202fperson\u207b\u00b9\u202fday\u207b\u00b9 in the US). |\n| **Stability** | Fluoride is chemically stable under normal municipal\u2011water pH (6.5\u20138.5) and temperature; it does not degrade or form harmful by\u2011products in the distribution system. |\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Demonstrated health benefits\n\n| Evidence | Main findings | Strength of evidence |\n|----------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of community water fluoridation (CWF)** | 7\u201110\u202f% reduction in dental caries in primary teeth and 20\u201130\u202f% reduction in permanent teeth compared with non\u2011fluoridated communities (e.g., *Burt & Eklund 1977; McDonagh et\u202fal. 2000*). | **High** \u2013 large, long\u2011term community trials with repeated follow\u2011up. |\n| **Systematic reviews/meta\u2011analyses** | Cochrane review (2000) concluded that CWF \u201csignificantly reduces caries prevalence\u201d and that the effect is **dose\u2011responsive** (higher fluoride \u2192 greater reduction). | **High** \u2013 multiple independent reviews (Cochrane, WHO 2017, ADA 2022). |\n| **Economic analyses** | For every US\u202f$1 spent on fluoridation, **$20\u2013$40** in dental\u2011care costs are saved (US Public Health Service, 2015). | **High** \u2013 based on real\u2011world cost data",
