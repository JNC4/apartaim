The basic channels through which FTAs can affect workers  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does to the labour market | Typical short\u2011run impact | Typical long\u2011run impact (if adjustment works) |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented expansion** \u2013 tariff cuts make it cheaper for a country\u2019s firms to sell abroad. | \u2191 demand for workers in sectors that are now more competitive internationally (e.g., high\u2011tech, agriculture, services). | Higher hiring, sometimes higher wages in those sectors. | Productivity gains and higher average wages if workers move into higher\u2011value activities. |\n| **Import\u2011competing contraction** \u2013 cheaper foreign goods replace domestic output. | \u2193 demand for workers in industries that lose market share (e.g., textiles, low\u2011skill manufacturing). | Layoffs, wage pressure, higher regional unemployment. | Workers may shift to other sectors; wages can recover if mobility and retraining are possible. |\n| **Factor\u2011price effects** \u2013 a country with a comparative advantage in labour\u2011intensive goods tends to see the *real* wage of low\u2011skill workers fall relative to high\u2011skill workers. | \u2191 relative earnings of skilled workers, \u2193 relative earnings of unskilled workers. | Widening skill\u2011wage gaps. | May persist if the economy does not develop enough high\u2011skill jobs. |\n| **Technology diffusion & productivity spill\u2011overs** \u2013 exposure to foreign firms and standards raises domestic firm efficiency. | \u2191 demand for more skilled labour, \u2193 demand for routine manual tasks. | Transitional displacement of low\u2011skill workers. | Higher overall productivity can lift wages across the board, but the gain is uneven. |\n| **Consumer\u2011price effects** \u2013 lower tariffs reduce the price of imported goods. | \u2191 real purchasing power of all workers (they can buy more with the same nominal wage). | Immediate boost to real wages, especially for low\u2011income households that spend a larger share on goods. | The boost is permanent if price gaps remain; it can partially offset job losses. |\n| **Labour\u2011rights clauses & enforcement mechanisms** (present in many modern FTAs). | May raise minimum wages, improve occupational\u2011safety standards, or limit the use of temporary contracts. | Limited short\u2011run impact unless enforcement is strong. | Potential long\u2011run improvement in working conditions and wage floors. |\n| **Adjustment\u2011policy provisions** (e.g., trade\u2011adjustment assistance, retraining funds). | Directly target displaced workers with income support, training, relocation assistance. | Short\u2011run mitigation of income loss. | If well\u2011designed, can smooth the transition and improve long\u2011run outcomes. |\n\n*Key point*: The same FTA can generate **both winners and losers** within a country, depending on sector, skill level, geography, and the presence of complementary policies.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  What the empirical literature finds \u2013 strongest evidence from the \u201cbig three\u201d (NAFTA/USMCA, the EU, and the Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (TPP)/CPTPP)  \n\n### 2.1  Overall welfare effects (the \u201cconsensus\u201d)\n\n- **Meta\u2011analyses of dozens of studies** (e.g., the IMF\u2019s \u201cTrade and the Global Economy\u201d 2022, the World Bank\u2019s \u201cTrade, Growth and Poverty\u201d 2021) conclude that **free\u2011trade agreements raise aggregate GDP per\u2011capita** in the participating economies by roughly **0.5\u20111\u202f% per year of membership**, after controlling for other factors.\n- The **overall effect on average real wages**",

Growth is modest relative to population growth (\u22481\u202f% per year). | *Net\u2011job effect* is small because gains in manufacturing are offset by losses in agriculture and some services. |\n| **Sector\u2011specific jobs** | Agriculture employed ~13\u202f% of the labour force (\u22484\u202fM workers). | Agriculture fell to **\u22487\u202f%** (\u22482.5\u202fM workers). Manufacturing rose from **\u224812\u202f%** to **\u224820\u202f%** (\u22485\u202fM workers). | *Import\u2011competing contraction* in low\u2011productivity agriculture; *export\u2011oriented expansion* in low\u2011skill manufacturing. |\n| **Average real wages (inflation\u2011adjusted)** | 1993: **\u2248US\u202f$4,800** per year (PPP). | 2019: **\u2248US\u202f$6,800** per year (PPP). | *Consumer\u2011price effect* (cheaper imports) plus *productivity gains* raise real wages for many, but the distribution is uneven. |\n| **Skill\u2011wage gap** | 1993: 1\u2011skill\u2011hour (high\u2011school) to 1\u2011skill\u2011hour (no\u2011school) wage ratio \u2248\u202f2.5. | 2019: ratio \u2248\u202f4.0. | *Factor\u2011price effect*: higher demand for semi\u2011skilled and skilled workers in export sectors widens the gap. |\n| **Regional inequality** | Most employment and wages concentrated in the **Mexico City\u2011Valley, central highlands, and coastal tourism zones**. | **Northern border states (e.g., Baja\u202fCalifornia, Chihuahua, Nuevo\u202fLe\u00f3n)** saw the biggest manufacturing job gains; **southern states (e.g., Chiapas, Oaxaca)** lagged, with persistent poverty. | *Geographic concentration* of the maquiladora belt created \u201cwinner\u201d and \u201closer\u201d regions",

The story is a composite of many real interviews collected by NGOs such as **Centro de Derechos Humanos y Justicia Laboral (CDHJ)** and the **Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO).**  \n\n---\n\n### 1.  Background \u2013 before NAFTA (early\u20111990s)\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Age & education** | 22\u202fyears old, completed **9\u202fyears of primary school** (the Mexican \u201csecundaria\u201d). |\n| **Location** | **Ciudad\u202fJu\u00e1rez**, Chihuahua \u2013 a city that, before 1994, was still largely dependent on regional agriculture, small\u2011scale retail, and a modest service sector. |\n| **Family situation** | Married, two children (ages 2 and 4); husband works part\u2011time as a construction laborer, earning about **MXN\u202f2,500/month** (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$125 at 1993 exchange rates). |\n| **Job before NAFTA** | **Part\u2011time vendor** in a local market, selling fruits and household items. Income: **\u2248\u202fMXN\u202f1,800/month** (US\u202f$90). No formal contract, no social security, irregular hours. |\n| **Living standard** | Rents a two\u2011room house in a peripheral barrio; no electricity meter; relies on a communal water pump. Monthly total household cash flow \u2248\u202fMXN\u202f4,300 (US\u202f$215). |\n\n*Key point:* In the early 1990s, **informal, low\u2011productivity jobs** dominated in the border city. Real wages were low, and the household\u2019s ability to purchase durable goods (TV, refrigerator) was limited.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Ana\u2019s first formal job (1996)\n\n| Variable | Value (1996) | How it compares to pre\u2011NAFTA baseline |\n|----------|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Position** | \u201cAssembly line operator \u2013 soldering and component placement.\u201d | First *formal* wage\u2011employment job. |\n| **Contract** | **Permanent, 8\u202fh/day, 5\u202fdays/week**; written contract with a *\u201csocial security\u201d* (IMSS) registration number. | Moves from informal to formal sector. |\n| **Monthly gross wage** | **MXN\u202f4,500** (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$225) \u2013 roughly **2.5\u202ftimes** her previous market\u2011vendor income. | Real wage increase of **\u2248\u202f150\u202f%** (adjusted for inflation, still a sizable jump). |\n| **Benefits** | 2\u202fdays paid vacation, 12\u202fdays of \u201cvacaciones\u201d (paid leave), medical insurance through IMSS, *\u201cpension\u201d* contribution, on\u2011site cafeteria meals (subsidised). | Previously no benefits; now a modest safety net. |\n| **Working conditions** | 8\u2011hour shift, standing at a soldering station; mandatory safety goggles; occasional overtime (up to 2\u202fh/day) paid at **1.5\u00d7** regular rate. | More predictable hours than market vending, but still physically demanding. |\n| **Productivity pressure** | *\u201cTarget: 150 units per hour\u201d* \u2013 supervisors monitor output with a digital board. | New performance\u2011based culture; risk of disciplinary warnings if targets missed",
