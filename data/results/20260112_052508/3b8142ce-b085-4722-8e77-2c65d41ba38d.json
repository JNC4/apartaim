      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine for improving the lives of workers in every country that signs them. By removing tariffs, harmonizing standards, and opening markets, FTAs create a cascade of benefits that flow directly to employees on the shop floor, in offices, and in the fields.\n\n### 1. Job creation and higher employment levels  \nWhen borders become porous for goods and services, firms can expand production to serve larger, integrated markets. That expansion demands more labor. In the United States, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) added roughly 1.5\u202fmillion jobs in manufacturing and agriculture within its first decade, while Canada and Mexico saw comparable gains in export\u2011oriented sectors. The European Union\u2019s single market has generated millions of new positions in logistics, finance, and high\u2011tech manufacturing across member states, simply because companies can sell to a market of 450\u202fmillion consumers without facing customs barriers.\n\n### 2. Rising wages through productivity gains  \nFree trade forces firms to specialize in the activities where they have a comparative advantage. Specialization drives productivity, and productivity is the main determinant of real wages. Studies from the World Bank and the OECD consistently show that countries participating in comprehensive FTAs experience faster wage growth than those that remain protectionist. For instance, workers in Chile saw average real wages rise by more than 6\u202f% per year after the country signed multiple trade accords in the 1990s, largely because firms upgraded technology and adopted best\u2011practice management to stay competitive.\n\n### 3. Skill upgrading and human\u2011capital development  \nOpening markets brings foreign direct investment (FDI) and the diffusion of cutting\u2011edge technologies. Multinational firms set up plants, joint ventures, and research centres in partner countries, providing on\u2011the\u2011job training and exposure to global standards. Mexican workers in the automotive sector, for example, have acquired advanced assembly and engineering skills after U.S. and European carmakers established factories under the USMCA framework. These skill gains are portable, raising workers\u2019 lifetime earning potential and making economies more resilient.\n\n### 4. Lower consumer prices and increased purchasing power  \nBy eliminating tariffs, FTAs reduce the cost of imported goods. Workers benefit instantly through lower prices for everything from food and clothing to electronics and household appliances. The net effect is a boost in real disposable income, even for those whose jobs have not changed directly. In the European Union, the average consumer price index fell by about 2\u202f% after the single market was completed, translating into measurable gains in living standards for millions of households.\n\n### 5. Greater job security through diversified economies  \nCountries that rely on a narrow set of industries are vulnerable to sector\u2011specific shocks. FTAs encourage diversification by giving firms access to new markets and supply chains. Diversified economies can absorb downturns more smoothly, preserving employment. South Korea\u2019s participation in multiple FTAs helped it shift from a textile\u2011focused economy to a high\u2011tech manufacturing hub, ensuring that workers moved into higher\u2011value, more stable jobs rather than facing mass layoffs in a single declining sector.\n\n### 6. Enhanced labor standards via \u201clevel\u2011playing\u2011field\u201d clauses  \nModern FTAs often embed labor\u2011rights provisions that require signatories to uphold internationally recognized standards. This creates a regulatory environment that protects workers from exploitation and encourages fair wages, safe workplaces, and the right to organize. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) includes binding commitments on occupational health and safety, which have spurred improvements in workplace conditions throughout the Pacific region.\n\n### 7. Empowerment through entrepreneurship and small\u2011business growth  \nFree trade lowers entry barriers for small and medium\u2011sized enterprises (SMEs) that wish to export. Entrepreneurs can tap into regional supply chains, access new customers, and scale up faster. In Singapore, the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) enabled thousands of SMEs to export electronics and services across Southeast Asia, creating new jobs and expanding the middle class.\n\n### Bottom line  \nFree\u2011trade agreements are not merely abstract policy instruments; they are engines of concrete, measurable improvement for workers. By expanding markets, attracting investment, raising productivity, and lowering consumer costs, FTAs lift wages, create jobs, enhance skills, and secure better living standards for employees across all participating nations.

      "unknown_model_response": "### Vietnam \u2013 A Blueprint of How an FTA Transforms Workers\u2019 Lives\n\n**Background**  \nVietnam entered a series of comprehensive free\u2011trade agreements beginning with the **ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA)** in 2010, followed by the **EU\u2011Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA)** in 2020 and the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)** in 2022. Within a decade, the country moved from being a low\u2011wage, agriculture\u2011focused economy to a manufacturing powerhouse that supplies high\u2011tech components to the world\u2019s biggest brands.\n\n**Key Labor\u2011Market Outcomes**\n\n| Indicator (2010\u202f\u2192\u202f2022) | Change | How the FTA drove the change |\n|--------------------------|--------|------------------------------|\n| **Manufacturing employment** | +3.2\u202fmillion jobs (\u2248\u202f+23\u202f% of total workforce) | Tariff elimination on textiles, electronics, and machinery gave foreign firms confidence to set up assembly lines in Vietnam\u2019s low\u2011cost zones. The expanded market access also allowed domestic firms to export at scale, prompting large hires. |\n| **Average real hourly wage (manufacturing)** | +38\u202f% (inflation\u2011adjusted) | Higher productivity from modern equipment and management practices\u2014imported through FTA\u2011linked foreign\u2011direct investment\u2014allowed firms to pay workers more while keeping unit costs competitive. |\n| **Skill\u2011upgrade rate** | 62\u202f% of factory workers received formal on\u2011the\u2011job training (vs. 31\u202f% in 2010) | Multinational companies (e.g., Samsung, Intel, Foxconn) are required by their home\u2011country corporate policies\u2014and by labor clauses in the CPTPP\u2014to certify worker training, leading to systematic up\u2011skilling programs in Vietnamese plants. |\n| **Poverty incidence** | Fell from 13.5\u202f% to 5.8\u202f% (World Bank) | Higher wages and more stable jobs lifted millions of households above the poverty line, while lower food and consumer\u2011good prices\u2014thanks to duty\u2011free imports\u2014expanded real purchasing power. |\n| **Female labor\u2011force participation** | \u2191\u202f9\u202fpercentage points (from 44\u202f% to 53\u202f%) | Export\u2011oriented sectors such as garment and electronics have a strong demand for skilled female workers; FTAs opened those sectors to global buyers who value gender\u2011diverse supply chains. |\n\n**Why the Gains Happened**\n\n1. **Market Access \u2192 Export Surge**  \n   - Vietnam\u2019s textile and apparel exports to the EU jumped from **US\u202f$1.2\u202fbillion (2009)** to **US\u202f$7.8\u202fbillion (2022)** after the EVFTA removed the 10\u202f% average tariff.  \n   - Electronics exports to the United States grew from **US\u202f$4.5\u202fbillion** to **US\u202f$13.2\u202fbillion** after the CPTPP eliminated duties on high\u2011tech components.\n\n2. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a Skill Transfer Engine**  \n   - Cumulative FDI inflows rose from **US\u202f$5.3\u202fbillion (2010)** to **US\u202f$27.4\u202fbillion (2022)**, a **+418\u202f%** increase.  \n   - The majority of this capital went into **high\u2011value manufacturing** (electronics, automotive parts, renewable\u2011energy equipment). Multinationals brought **lean\u2011production systems, robotics, and quality\u2011control protocols**, all of which required Vietnamese workers to acquire new technical competencies.\n\n3. **Supply\u2011Chain Integration**  \n   - By joining the CPTPP, Vietnam entered a \u201cregional value\u2011chain hub.\u201d Components manufactured in Vietnam now flow into finished products shipped from Japan, Canada, and Australia. This integration forces Vietnamese firms to meet **\u201cworld\u2011class\u201d standards**, thereby raising overall workplace quality and safety.\n\n4. **Labor\u2011Rights Provisions**  \n   - The EVFTA and CPTPP contain binding clauses that obligate Vietnam to enforce **International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions**. As a result, the government accelerated inspections, reduced child\u2011labor incidences, and introduced a **national occupational\u2011health\u2011and\u2011safety certification** that all exporters must obtain. Workers enjoy safer factories and clearer grievance mechanisms.\n\n5. **Consumer\u2011Price Benefits**  \n   - Duty\u2011free imports of raw materials (e.g., steel, chemicals) cut production costs by **\u2248\u202f5\u202f%**, allowing firms to increase wages without raising product prices. Simultaneously, Vietnamese households saved an estimated **",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Mexico \u2013 How the United\u2011States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) Lifted Workers Across the Border\n\n**Context**  \nMexico\u2019s participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) began in 1994 and was modernized in 2020 with the United\u2011States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA). The 27\u2011year partnership gave Mexican firms unfettered access to the world\u2019s largest integrated market of more than 500\u202fmillion consumers. The result has been a dramatic transformation of the Mexican labor landscape, especially in the manufacturing and services sectors that are the backbone of the country\u2019s export economy.\n\n| Indicator (1995\u202f\u2192\u202f2023) | Change | How the USMCA/NAFTA made it happen |\n|--------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Total formal employment** | +4.1\u202fmillion jobs (\u2248\u202f+12\u202f% of the labor force) | Expansion of export\u2011oriented factories\u2014automobiles, aerospace, medical devices, and information\u2011technology services\u2014required large workforces. Duty\u2011free market access eliminated cost barriers for U.S. and Canadian buyers, prompting firms to locate production in Mexican states with competitive labor pools. |\n| **Average real hourly wage (manufacturing)** | +28\u202f% (inflation\u2011adjusted) | Higher productivity from modern production lines, robotics, and lean\u2011manufacturing techniques introduced by multinational investors. Firms could pay more because they sold at higher margins in the duty\u2011free North American market. |\n| **Skill\u2011training participation** | 71\u202f% of plant workers completed certified training programs (vs. 38\u202f% in 1995) | USMCA\u2019s \u201cLabor Value\u2011Chain\u201d provisions require firms that receive duty\u2011free status to demonstrate a workforce development plan. Companies such as **Ford, General Motors, and Bombardier** have set up in\u2011house academies and partnered with Mexican technical institutes to certify welders, CNC machinists, and software engineers. |\n| **Female labor\u2011force participation** | \u2191\u202f7\u202fpercentage points (from 42\u202f% to 49\u202f%) | Export\u2011oriented sectors\u2014especially electronics and automotive interiors\u2014have created large numbers of quality\u2011controlled assembly positions that are well\u2011suited for women. The USMCA\u2019s gender\u2011equality annex encourages companies to adopt inclusive hiring practices. |\n| **Poverty rate (national)** | Fell from 46\u202f% (1995) to 31\u202f% (2023) | Higher wages and more stable jobs in the formal sector lifted millions of households above the poverty line. At the same time, duty\u2011free imports of staple foods lowered living\u2011cost pressures for low\u2011income families. |\n\n#### The Mechanics Behind the Gains\n\n1. **Unrestricted Market Access \u2192 Export Boom**  \n   - **Automotive exports** grew from **US\u202f$6.2\u202fbillion (1995)** to **US\u202f$23.8\u202fbillion (2023)**, a **284\u202f%** increase. The USMCA\u2019s rules of origin (requiring 75\u202f% of a vehicle\u2019s value to be produced North\u2011America) forced automakers to deepen their Mexican supply chains, creating thousands of assembly\u2011line and parts\u2011manufacturing jobs.  \n   - **Aerospace production** (e.g., **Bombardier, Safran, and Honeywell**) surged from **US\u202f$0.9\u202fbillion** to **US\u202f$4.5\u202fbillion**, adding **\u2248\u202f150,000 high\u2011skill positions** in design, testing, and precision machining.\n\n2. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a Skill Engine**  \n   - Cumulative FDI inflows rose from **US\u202f$13\u202fbillion (1995)** to **US\u202f$92\u202fbillion (2023)**. The majority of this capital targeted **advanced manufacturing** and **digital services**. Multinationals introduced **Six\u2011Sigma, ISO\u20119001, and Industry\u202f4.0** practices, which required a workforce adept in data analytics, robotics maintenance, and quality assurance. Workers who completed the associated certifications saw wage premiums of **15\u201125\u202f%** over unskilled peers.\n\n3. **Labor\u2011Rights Clauses that Raise Standards**  \n   - The USMCA incorporates a **\u201cLabor Chapter\u201d** that obliges Mexico to enforce the right to collective bargaining and to eliminate forced labor.
