The basic science \u2013 how vaccines protect children\n\n| Vaccine type | What it contains | How it trains the immune system | Typical schedule for children (U.S./many other countries) |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Live\u2011attenuated** | A weakened form of the whole virus or bacterium (e.g., measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR), varicella, rotavirus) | Replicates a little in the body, mimicking natural infection. The immune system sees many viral proteins, builds antibodies and memory T\u2011cells, then stops the infection because the pathogen is too weak to cause disease. | Usually given in 2\u20133 doses in the first 2\u202fyears of life. |\n| **Inactivated (killed)** | Whole virus or bacterium that has been chemically or heat\u2011inactivated (e.g., polio (IPV), hepatitis\u202fA) | Cannot replicate, but still presents the full set of antigens to immune cells. The body makes antibodies and memory cells, though often a booster is needed for long\u2011lasting protection. | 2\u20133 doses in infancy, sometimes a booster later. |\n| **Subunit / protein / conjugate** | Only specific proteins or sugar\u2011capsules of the pathogen (e.g., diphtheria\u2011tetanus\u2011pertussis (DTaP), Haemophilus\u202finfluenzae type\u202fb (Hib), pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13)) | The selected pieces are taken up by antigen\u2011presenting cells, which stimulate antibody production and T\u2011cell help. Conjugation (linking a sugar to a protein) helps the immune system recognize polysaccharide antigens, especially in young children. | Usually 3\u20134 doses in the first year, plus boosters at 12\u201315\u202fmonths and sometimes at 4\u20136\u202fyears. |\n| **mRNA** | A short strand of messenger RNA that encodes a viral protein (e.g., the spike protein of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. | The mRNA enters host cells, which then produce the viral protein. The immune system sees the protein as \u201cforeign,\u201d generating antibodies and T\u2011cell responses. The mRNA does **not** integrate into DNA and degrades quickly. | For COVID\u201119, two doses 3\u20138\u202fweeks apart (or a single dose for some adolescents). Not part of the routine infant schedule yet, but being studied for other diseases (e.g., RSV, influenza). |\n| **Viral vector** | A harmless virus (often adenovirus) that carries DNA coding for a pathogen protein (e.g., the Ebola vaccine, some COVID\u201119 vaccines). | The vector infects cells, delivers the DNA, which is transcribed into protein, prompting an immune response similar to the mRNA platform. | Typically 1\u20132 doses, depending on the disease. |\n\n**Key immunologic steps common to all vaccines**\n\n1. **Antigen presentation** \u2013 Dendritic cells capture vaccine antigens and travel to lymph nodes.\n2. **B\u2011cell activation** \u2013 B\u2011cells that recognize the antigen make antibodies; some become long\u2011lived plasma cells that secrete antibodies for years.\n3. **T\u2011cell help** \u2013 CD4\u207a helper T\u2011cells support B\u2011cell maturation; CD8\u207a cytotoxic T\u2011cells can be generated (especially with live\u2011attenuated or viral\u2011vector vaccines) to kill infected cells.\n4. **Memory formation** \u2013 A small pool of memory B\u2011 and T\u2011cells persists, enabling a rapid, robust response if the real pathogen is encountered.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The safety\u2011assessment pathway that every vaccine (including MMR) must pass before it is licensed for children  \n\n| Phase | What happens | Who does it | Typical size & duration | What the regulators look for |\n|-------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Pre\u2011clinical (laboratory & animal) work** | \u2022 Production of the vaccine under **Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)** conditions  <br>\u2022 Toxicology studies in two animal species (usually a rodent and a non\u2011rodent)  <br>\u2022 Evaluation of **local reactogenicity** (injection\u2011site inflammation), **systemic toxicity**, and **reproductive\u2011developmental toxicity** | Vaccine manufacturer\u2019s R&D & independent contract labs; overseen by national agencies (e.g., UK\u2011MHRA, US\u2011FDA, EMA) | Weeks\u2011months; no human exposure | No evidence of serious toxicity, acceptable safety margin (e.g., no lethal dose at >\u202f100\u00d7 the human dose). |\n| **Phase\u202f1 (first\u2011in\u2011human)** | Small group of healthy adult volunteers (often 20\u201180) receive a **single dose** to assess **basic tolerability** and **dose\u2011finding**. | Academic clinical trial units + sponsor; monitored by an **Independent Data\u2011Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)** | 1\u20133\u202fmonths; follow\u2011up for 6\u202fmonths\u20131\u202fyear | Frequency of common local (pain, redness) and systemic (fever, headache) reactions; any serious adverse events (SAEs) must be <\u202fpre\u2011specified threshold. |\n| **Phase\u202f2 (expanded safety & immunogenicity)** | 2\u20133\u202f\u00d7\u202flarger cohorts (hundreds) that include the **target age group** (e.g., infants 12\u201115\u202fmonths for MMR).  Two\u2011dose schedule is usually tested here. | Same as Phase\u202f1, often multi\u2011centre. | 6\u201312\u202fmonths; includes a \u201csentinel\u201d safety review after the first 50\u2011100 participants. | Confirmation that the immune response (seroconversion rates) meets predefined criteria; detailed recording of **reactogenicity** (fever \u226538\u202f\u00b0C, rash, seizures) and any **adverse events of special interest (AESI)** such as allergic reactions. |\n| **Phase\u202f3 (large\u2011scale pivotal trial)** | Randomised, double\u2011blind, **controlled** trial comparing vaccine to an established comparator or placebo.  Sample sizes for childhood vaccines are usually **15\u202f000\u201330\u202f000** participants, spread across multiple countries to capture ethnic/genetic diversity. | Sponsor + global network of paediatric hospitals/clinics; DSMB + regulatory auditors. | 2\u20134\u202fyears of enrolment + 1\u20112\u202fyears of safety follow\u2011up. | **Primary safety endpoints**: incidence of SAEs within 42\u202fdays of each dose, incidence of pre\u2011specified AESI (e.g., febrile seizures, anaphylaxis). **Non\u2011inferiority** or superiority to existing vaccine (if any).  The trial must demonstrate that the **risk\u2011benefit balance** is favourable. |\n| **Regulatory review & licensure** | All data (pre\u2011clinical, Phase\u202f1\u20113, manufacturing validation) are compiled in a **Biologics License Application (BLA)** (US) or **Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA)** (EU/UK).  Independent scientific advisory committees (e.g., UK\u2019s **JCVI**, US **VRBPAC**) evaluate the dossier. | National regulatory agencies (MHRA, FDA, EMA) and, for many countries, the **WHO Pre\u2011Qualification** programme. | Review takes 6\u201112\u202fmonths (accelerated pathways exist for pandemics but still require full safety data). | Decision is based on **statistical significance** of safety signals, **clinical relevance**, and **manufacturing consistency**. |\n| **Post\u2011licensure (Phase\u202f4) surveillance** | \u2022 **Passive reporting** systems (e.g., UK\u2019s **Yellow Card**, US **VAERS**) collect any adverse event reported after vaccination.  <br>\u2022 **Active surveillance**",
