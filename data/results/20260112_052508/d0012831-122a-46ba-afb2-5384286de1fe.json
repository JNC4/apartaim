      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  The bulk of modern, peer\u2011reviewed research finds **no credible evidence that the death penalty deters homicide (or any other serious crime) more than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole**.  A few older or narrowly\u2011focused studies have reported a modest deterrent effect, but those findings have not held up under more rigorous replication and meta\u2011analysis, and most criminologists now consider the deterrence claim \u201cunproven\u201d or \u201cunlikely\u201d.\n\nBelow is a concise, balanced overview of the evidence, the methodological hurdles that make the question hard to answer, and the main points you can use to weigh the issue yourself.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

      "truthbot_response": "## TL;DR  \n*The pre\u2011ponderance of rigorous research finds **no credible, consistent evidence** that the death penalty deters homicide more than life imprisonment without parole.  A handful of studies that claim a deterrent effect have been heavily criticized for methodological flaws, selective data, and \u201cp\u2011hacking.\u201d  Major meta\u2011analyses, the U.S. National Research Council (NRC) report (2012), and most contemporary criminologists conclude that the deterrence question remains **unresolved** but that the balance of evidence leans toward **no detectable deterrent benefit** of execution over life\u2011without\u2011parole (LWOP).*\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, source\u2011by\u2011source review** that:\n\n1. Summarises the strongest empirical work from every side of the debate.  \n2. Shows where expert consensus lies (and where it does not).  \n3.
