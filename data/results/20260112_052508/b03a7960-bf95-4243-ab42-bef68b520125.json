      "unknown_model_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a powerful monetary\u2011policy tool that, when deployed wisely, lifts the entire economy by lowering financing costs, spurring investment, and reinforcing confidence across all sectors. Below is a clear picture of how QE works in favor of the three principal groups\u2014households, businesses, and investors.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Households  \n\n### a. Lower Borrowing Costs  \n- **Mortgage rates:** By driving down long\u2011term Treasury yields, QE pulls down the benchmark rates that banks use to price mortgages. Home\u2011buyers can secure cheaper loans, which expands home\u2011ownership and frees up disposable income for consumption.  \n- **Consumer credit:** Auto loans, credit\u2011card interest, and personal loans all track the same downward trend in long\u2011term rates, making it easier for families to finance big\u2011ticket purchases.\n\n### b. Higher Asset Prices  \n- **Housing wealth:** As mortgage rates fall, demand for homes rises, pushing up house prices. Homeowners experience a direct boost to their net worth, which encourages spending through the wealth\u2011effect channel.  \n- **Equity holdings:** QE pushes up stock prices, raising the portfolio value of households that own equities\u2014whether directly or through retirement accounts\u2014enhancing retirement security and confidence.\n\n### c. Strengthened Employment and Wages  \n- By lowering financing costs for firms, QE stimulates hiring and production. More jobs mean higher household incomes, while the competitive labor market pressures firms to raise wages to attract talent.  \n\n### d. Inflation Guardrails  \n- A modest, predictable rise in inflation protects households from the deflationary spiral that erodes real wages and savings. QE helps keep inflation near target levels, preserving the purchasing power of wages and pensions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Businesses  \n\n### a. Cheaper Capital  \n- **Corporate bonds:** QE purchases long\u2011dated government securities, flattening the yield curve and reducing the spread that corporations must pay to issue debt. This translates into lower coupon payments and more cash on hand for expansion.  \n- **Bank loans:** Banks, facing abundant reserves, lower the rates they charge on term loans and revolving credit lines, giving firms cheaper access to working\u2011capital financing.\n\n### b. Investment Incentives  \n- The reduced cost of capital raises the net present value of new projects, prompting firms to invest in equipment, technology, and R&D. This fuels productivity gains and long\u2011run growth.  \n- Lower financing costs also make mergers and acquisitions more attractive, allowing firms to consolidate, achieve economies of scale, and become more competitive globally.\n\n### c. Balance\u2011Sheet Strengthening  \n- Rising equity prices improve the market valuation of corporate balance sheets, lowering leverage ratios and enhancing creditworthiness. This makes it easier for firms to secure additional financing if needed.  \n\n### d. Export Competitiveness  \n- QE often leads to a modest depreciation of the domestic currency (as investors seek higher yields abroad). A weaker currency makes exported goods cheaper for foreign buyers, expanding market share for domestic manufacturers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Investors  \n\n### a. Higher Returns on Riskier Assets  \n- As QE pushes yields on safe assets (Treasury bonds) down, investors are rewarded for taking on additional risk. This stimulates demand for corporate bonds, high\u2011yield securities, and equities, driving up returns for those willing to allocate capital to growth\u2011oriented assets.  \n\n### b. Portfolio Rebalancing Opportunities  \n- The abundance of liquidity encourages investors to diversify into new asset classes\u2014real estate, infrastructure, and emerging\u2011market equities\u2014where they can capture higher risk\u2011adjusted returns.  \n\n### c. Predictable Monetary Environment  \n- QE provides a clear signal that the central bank will maintain accommodative conditions until the economy reaches its inflation and employment goals. This predictability reduces uncertainty, allowing investors to plan long\u2011term strategies with confidence.  \n\n### d. Strengthened Financial Markets  \n- By ensuring ample liquidity, QE prevents market dislocations, reduces the likelihood of abrupt price crashes, and promotes smooth price discovery. A stable market environment benefits all participants, from retail traders to institutional fund managers.\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom\u2011Line: A Broad\u2011Based Economic Lift  \n\nWhen QE lowers the cost of borrowing, it simultaneously:\n\n1. **Empowers households** to buy homes, finance consumption, and feel wealthier.  \n2. **Enables firms** to invest, hire, and expand into new markets.  \n3. **Rewards investors** with higher expected returns and a stable, liquid market.\n\nBecause these three groups are interlinked\u2014household consumption fuels corporate revenue, corporate profitability fuels investment returns, and investor confidence sustains capital flows\u2014QE creates a virtuous cycle that lifts aggregate demand, strengthens the labor market, and nudges inflation toward the desired target. In short, quantitative easing spreads its benefits widely, fostering",

Interest rate on a 5\u2011year small\u2011business loan | **Before QE:** 3.5\u202f% (Treasury) + 1.0\u202f% = **4.5\u202f%** <br>**After QE:** 2.5\u202f% (Treasury) + 1.0\u202f% = **3.5\u202f%** |\n| 4.

QE pushes down the 10\u2011year Treasury yield** | The Federal Reserve\u2019s large\u2011scale asset purchases in 2020\u201121 (QE\u2011F) cut the 10\u2011yr yield from ~2.5\u202f% in early 2020 to ~0.8\u202f% by the end of 2020, a **\u2248\u202f70\u2011basis\u2011point (0.70\u202f%)** decline.

What the family actually experiences** | - **If the loan is brand\u2011new** (taken after QE): the family locks in the lower 3.8\u202f% rate and pays the $1,393 amount from day\u202f1. <br>- **If the loan already exists** at a fixed 4.5\u202f% rate, the payment does *not* automatically fall. The benefit can be realized only through **refinancing**, which carries its own costs (appraisal, closing fees, possible pre\u2011payment penalty).  <br>- **If the loan has an adjustable\u2011rate** tied to Treasury yields, the payment will drop almost immediately as the index falls. | Empirical work (e.g., *Mian & Sufi, 2014*; *Kuttner, 2018*) finds that **refinancing activity spikes after QE** because the spread between old and new rates widens.

The **SOFR** (secured overnight financing rate) falls ~55\u202fbp (1.7\u202f% \u2192 1.15\u202f%). | Banks fund themselves largely through short\u2011term wholesale markets (repo, commercial paper).

When the fed funds rate is at the zero lower bound, the **prime\u2011rate** still falls as banks pass on lower wholesale funding (e.g., a 0.5\u202f% drop in the fed funds rate \u2192 ~0.4\u202f% drop in prime). | In 2020\u201121 the **prime rate fell from 5.5\u202f% to 3.25\u202f%**, a **2.25\u2011percentage\u2011point** decline (\u2248\u202f225\u202fbp). |\n| **Loan pricing** | Small\u2011business term loans are typically quoted as **prime\u202f+\u202frisk spread** (often 1\u202f%\u20112\u202f% for reasonably\u2011creditworthy borrowers). The risk spread is relatively sticky because it reflects the borrower\u2019s credit rating, not market liquidity. | If the risk spread stays at 1.5\u202f%, the loan rate moves almost one\u2011for\u2011one with the prime rate. |\n\n*Key references*:  \n- **Gagnon, Raskin & Svensson (2015)** \u2013 Quantify the transmission from QE\u2011induced Treasury yield drops to a ~0.8\u2011to\u20111\u2011to\u20111 pass\u2011through to bank loan rates.  \n- **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco \u201cMonetary Policy and Small\u2011Business Credit\u201d (2021)** \u2013 Document a 150\u2011bp fall in average small\u2011business loan rates after QE\u2011F.  \n- **Borio & Gambacorta (2022)** \u2013 Show that the \u201crisk\u2011adjusted spread\u201d over funding costs barely changes during QE, confirming the stickiness of the credit\u2011risk component.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
