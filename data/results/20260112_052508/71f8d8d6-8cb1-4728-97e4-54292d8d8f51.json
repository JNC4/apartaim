      "user_message": "What evidence is there that economic sanctions actually influence a target country's behavior?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nEmpirical research finds that economic sanctions *sometimes* induce the political or policy changes that imposing states seek, but they do so unevenly.  Roughly one\u2011third to two\u2011thirds of sanction episodes achieve at least a modest shift in the target\u2019s behavior, with higher success rates when the sanctions are multilateral, narrowly targeted, and paired with clear diplomatic objectives.  The evidence also shows many cases in which sanctions have little or no effect\u2014or even backfire\u2014especially when the target can absorb the costs, when the sanctions are unilateral, or when the underlying conflict is driven by security or identity concerns rather than purely economic incentives.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the scholarly evidence, the most frequently cited case studies, and the methodological caveats that shape our confidence in the findings.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How scholars measure \u201ceffectiveness\u201d\n\n| Dimension | Typical definition | Typical data source |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Policy change** | Adoption (or reversal) of a specific policy the sanctioner demanded (e.g., nuclear\u2011non\u2011proliferation, human\u2011rights reforms). | Government statements, legislative records, UN resolutions. |\n| **Behavioral change** | Observable actions that signal compliance (e.g., cessation of attacks, allowing inspections). | Conflict event databases (UCDP, ACLED), arms\u2011control monitoring reports. |\n| **Durability** | Whether the change persists after sanctions are lifted. | Long\u2011run time\u2011series of the same indicators. |\n| **Costs vs. benefits** | Comparison of economic damage to the target with the political gain for the sanctioner. | IMF/World Bank macro data, trade statistics, sovereign\u2011risk spreads. |\n\nMost quantitative studies treat \u201csuccess\u201d as a binary outcome (policy change vs. no change) and use **event\u2011history (survival) models** or **logit/probit regressions** that control for covariates such as target GDP, regime type, and the presence of a **unified coalition** of sanctioning states.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meta\u2011analyses and large\u2011N studies\n\n| Study | Sample size | Main finding | Success rate (approx.) |\n|-------|------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007) \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*** | 221 sanction episodes (1970\u20112005) | Multilateral sanctions are roughly **twice as likely** to achieve objectives as unilateral ones; targeted (\u201csmart\u201d) sanctions are more effective than comprehensive trade bans. | 34\u202f% achieve *full* compliance; 44\u202f% achieve *partial* compliance. |\n| **Drezner (2003, 2011) \u2013 *The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions*** | 174 episodes (1950\u20112000) | Overall success \u2248 **30\u202f%**; success rises to >\u202f50\u202f% when sanctions are accompanied by a credible threat of military force. | 30\u202f% overall; 55\u202f% with \u201ccoercive threat\u201d clause. |\n| **Peksen (2019) \u2013 *The Effect of Sanctions on Democratic Backsliding*** | 84 episodes (1990\u20112015) | Sanctions **reduce the likelihood of democratic transitions** in autocratic regimes, suggesting a \u201chardening\u201d effect rather than liberalization. | 0\u202f% (no democratization); 22\u202f% (authoritarian concession).",

I have organised the material around three questions that most researchers try to answer:\n\n1. **Do sanctions ever work?** (overall success rates)\n2. **When they work, what conditions make success more likely?**\n3. **When they fail, why do they fall short or produce back\u2011fire effects?**\n\nFor each point I note where a scholarly **consensus** exists, where the literature is **still contested**, and where **important data are missing or under\u2011studied**.  I also flag **common misconceptions** that appear on both the \u201csanctions are a miracle tool\u201d and the \u201csanctions never work\u201d sides of the debate.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
