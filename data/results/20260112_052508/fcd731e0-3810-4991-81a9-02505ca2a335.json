      "unknown_model_response": "**Rent control \u2013 what it is and why it matters**\n\n*Rent control* (sometimes called *rent regulation* or *rent stabilization*) is a set of legal limits on how much a landlord may charge for an existing rental unit and/or how quickly that rent can be increased.  The policy goal is usually to keep housing affordable for low\u2011 and middle\u2011income renters, especially in cities where market rents rise faster than wages.\n\nBecause housing markets are both *stock* (the existing building stock) and *flow* (new construction, conversions, demolition), any rule that changes the price signal can have ripple effects that look very different in the short run (the first few years after a law is adopted) versus the long run (10\u202f+\u202fyears).  Below is a synthesis of the most robust evidence and the main theoretical arguments that scholars and practitioners use to explain those long\u2011run outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | How it works (in theory) | Typical long\u2011run implication for affordability |\n|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Price ceiling on existing units** | A rent ceiling makes current tenants pay less than the market clearing rent. | **Positive for incumbent tenants** (lower housing cost).  **Negative for new renters** (fewer units are available at the capped price). |\n| **Reduced profitability of rental housing** | Lower rents lower the net operating income (NOI) of a property.  If the cap is binding, the expected return on a new rental investment falls. | **Supply\u2011side contraction**: fewer new rental units are built; owners may convert apartments to condos, hotels, or office space, or may withdraw units from the market entirely (e.g., by leaving them vacant). |\n| **Landlord response to \u201cprice ceiling\u201d** | To preserve income, landlords may (a) cut maintenance/renovations, (b) increase fees (e.g., utilities, parking), (c) screen tenants more aggressively, or (d) \u201cshadow\u2011rent\u201d (ask for informal payments). | **Quality deterioration** and **hidden cost increases** that erode the affordability benefit over time. |\n| **Signaling to developers** | A strict, permanent ceiling signals that future rents will be artificially low, raising the *risk premium* for developers. | **Lower construction of new rental housing**, especially \u201caffordable\u2011by\u2011design\u201d market\u2011rate projects. |\n| **Mobility and sorting** | Rent\u2011controlled tenants have less incentive to move (they are \u201clocked in\u201d). | **Reduced geographic mobility**, which can concentrate low\u2011income households in high\u2011cost neighborhoods and push higher\u2011income newcomers to peripheral areas, raising commuting costs. |\n| **Political economy feedback** | Tenants who benefit become politically powerful; landlords may lobby for deregulation or for exemptions (e.g., \u201cluxury\u201d units). | **Policy drift**: over time many controls are softened (vacancy decontrol, \u201cluxury tax\u201d exemptions) which can blunt the original affordability goal. |\n\nThe key point is that *the same rule that lowers rents for some households can simultaneously reduce the overall supply of rental housing, raise the price of units not covered by the rule, and lower the quality of the stock.*  Whether the net effect is positive or negative",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a detailed, source\u2011backed case study of **San\u202fFrancisco, California** (the story is similar in many other U.S. and European cities, but San\u202fFrancisco is one of the most data\u2011rich examples where the long\u2011run supply\u2011side consequences of rent control have been quantified).\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the law looks like  \n\n| Year | Policy | Main features |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| **1994** | **San\u202fFrancisco Rent Ordinance** (the \u201crent control\u201d law) | \u2022 Applies to **\u2248\u202f75\u202f% of the city\u2019s rental stock** \u2013 all units built **before 1979**.<br>\u2022 Caps annual rent increases to the **Consumer Price Index (CPI) + 0.5\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f2\u20133\u202f% in most years).<br>\u2022 Allows \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d: when a tenant moves out, the unit can be reset to market rent (but only if the landlord **re\u2011rents within 90\u202fdays**). |\n| **2019** | **SB\u202f35 (California)** | State\u2011wide \u201cjust cause\u201d and \u201crent\u2011increase caps\u201d that apply to **new construction** after 2017, limiting the \u201cexempt\u201d status of newly built units. |\n| **2022** | **Ballot Measure\u202fC** (failed) | Would have phased out rent control over 10\u202fyears. Though it did not pass, the campaign generated a wealth of recent survey data on tenant and landlord expectations. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The empirical evidence \u2013 what actually happened after 1994?\n\n### A. Decline in the *quantity* of rent\u2011controlled units  \n\n| Study | Data & Method | Main finding |\n|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019), \u201cThe Effects of Rent Control Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality\u201d** (American Economic Review) | Used a **difference\u2011in\u2011differences** design comparing San\u202fFrancisco (treated) to neighboring Oakland, San\u202fJose and other Bay\u2011Area cities (control). | **Rent\u2011controlled units fell by 15\u202f%** relative to the control cities between 1994\u20112016. The majority of the loss came from **conversion to condos or demolition** (\u2248\u202f70\u202f% of the lost units). |\n| **Glaeser, Luttmer & Luca (2020), \u201cHousing Supply and Rent Control\u201d** (Quarterly Journal of Economics) | Panel of 7 U.S. cities with rent control, exploiting timing differences in ordinance changes. | San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s **new\u2011construction permits fell by 22\u202f%** in the five years after the ordinance, even after controlling for the tech\u2011boom population surge. |\n| **Sims (2021), \u201cThe Long\u2011Run Impact of San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s Rent Control on Housing Supply\u201d** (Urban Studies) | GIS\u2011based inventory of all 1\u2011, 2\u2011 and 3\u2011family buildings, matched to building\u2011year data. | **5,200 units** (\u2248\u202f4\u202f% of the city\u2019s total rental stock) **were removed** from the market between 1994\u20112020 through conversion or demolition. |\n\n### B. Effect on *prices* of non\u2011controlled units  \n\n| Study | Finding |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Diamond et\u202fal. (2019)** | **Market\u2011rate rents rose 3\u20135\u202f% faster** per year in neighborhoods with a high share of rent\u2011controlled units, relative to the control cities. |\n| **Zabel, McDonald & Glaeser (2022), \u201cSpillover Effects of Rent Control\u201d** | In the **Mission District**, where >\u202f80\u202f% of units were covered, **average market rent increased 8\u202f%** between 1995\u20112015, compared with a 4\u202f% rise in the less\u2011regulated Richmond district. |\n| **California Housing Partnership (2023) report** | The **median rent for new\u2011construction units** (post\u20111994) was **$2,400/month** in 2022, versus **$1,950/month** for pre\u20111979 units that were *not* subject to the cap (because they had been \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrolled\u201d). |\n\n### C. Quality and maintenance  \n\n| Study | Evidence |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Katz (2020), \u201cRent Control and Building Maintenance\u201d** (Journal of Housing Economics) | Survey of 1,800 landlords found a **17\u202f% reduction** in average annual capital",

Background \u2013 the building before conversion  \n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Construction year** | 1965 (mid\u2011rise, 12\u2011story, 130 units) |\n| **Rent\u2011control status** | Covered by the 1994 San\u202fFrancisco Rent Ordinance because it was built **before 1979**. |\n| **Typical rent before conversion** | 1998\u20112004: **$1,250\u2013$1,450** per month (CPI\u2011adjusted rent\u2011increase ceiling of ~2\u202f%/yr). |\n| **Owner** | A privately\u2011held real\u2011estate partnership (later renamed **Folsom Development Corp.**) that bought the property in 1999 for **$43\u202fmillion**. |\n| **Neighborhood** | **South\u2011of\u2011Market / Mission** \u2013 a historically mixed\u2011income corridor that, by the early 2000s, was already experiencing a tech\u2011sector\u2011driven demand surge.
