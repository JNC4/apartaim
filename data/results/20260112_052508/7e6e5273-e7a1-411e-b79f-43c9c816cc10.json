      "truthbot_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a quick reminder**  \nQE is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets (usually government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities) with newly created reserves.  The aim is to lower long\u2011term interest rates, support credit\u2011market functioning, and raise aggregate demand when the policy rate is already near zero.\n\nBecause QE works **through financial markets**, its impacts are filtered through the holdings of those markets and the channels (interest\u2011rate, portfolio\u2011rebalancing, exchange\u2011rate, expectations) that affect different groups.  Below is a synthesis of the **strongest empirical and theoretical evidence** on how QE has affected \u2013 or is expected to affect \u2013 various households, firms, and institutions.  Where the literature is robust, I flag the scholarly consensus; where results are mixed or still being debated, I note the range of findings and the key uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels and why they matter for distribution\n\n| Channel | What it does | Primary groups affected (directly or indirectly) |\n|---------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Interest\u2011rate channel** | QE pushes up the price of bonds \u2192 long\u2011term yields fall (government, corporate, mortgage rates). | Borrowers (mortgage holders, firms with debt) get cheaper financing; savers receive lower returns on safe assets. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing channel** | When the central bank buys safe assets, investors sell them and move into riskier assets (stocks, high\u2011yield bonds, real estate). | Holders of financial assets (equities, corporate bonds, REITs) see price gains; those whose wealth is concentrated in cash or low\u2011yield bonds see little benefit. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Lower domestic yields relative to foreign ones tend to depreciate the domestic currency. | Export\u2011oriented firms and workers benefit from a weaker currency; import\u2011dependent households face higher import prices. |\n| **Expectations / \u201cconfidence\u201d channel** | QE signals that the central bank is committed to keeping financing conditions accommodative. | Broad macro\u2011economy: firms may invest more, households may spend more; the effect is indirect and diffused. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011space channel** (secondary) | By keeping borrowing costs low, QE can reduce the interest burden on sovereign debt, freeing fiscal space. | Taxpayers (potentially) benefit if the government redirects saved interest costs to spending or tax cuts; the effect depends on fiscal decisions. |\n\n*Why distribution matters*: Each channel interacts with the **asset\u2011ownership profile**, **income source**, and **exposure to interest\u2011rate changes** of different groups.  The net distributional impact is therefore the sum of several offsetting forces.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence says \u2013 consensus, debates, and gaps  \n\n### 2.1.

Why QE pushes mortgage rates down \u2013 the \u201crate channel\u201d in a nutshell  \n\n| Step | QE action | Market reaction | How it translates to mortgage rates |\n|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **a. Asset purchases** | The Fed buys \\$1.5\u202ftrillion of Treasury and agency\u2011MBS each month (QE\u20113, 2012\u20112014). | Demand for long\u2011dated Treasuries and mortgage\u2011backed securities (MBS) rises \u2192 their prices go up, yields fall. | The **10\u2011yr Treasury yield** fell from \u2248\u202f3.5\u202f% (early 2010) to \u2248\u202f2.0\u202f% (late 2015). The **10\u2011yr Treasury\u2011plus\u2011MBS spread** stayed roughly constant, so the **10\u2011yr MBS yield** also fell by ~1.5\u2011percentage\u2011points. |\n| **b. Benchmark transmission** | Most U.S. mortgage rates are set as a spread over the 10\u2011yr Treasury (or over the 10\u2011yr swap). | When the Treasury benchmark drops, the spread stays roughly the same (\u2248\u202f1.0\u20111.5\u202fppt for a 30\u2011yr fixed). | **30\u2011yr fixed mortgage rate** fell from ~5.0\u202f% (2010) to ~3.6\u202f% (2015) \u2013 a **1.4\u2011ppt** reduction, matching the Treasury move. |\n| **c. Credit\u2011supply effect** | QE also lowered banks\u2019 funding costs (they could borrow cheap reserves). | Banks faced less pressure to raise loan rates to cover funding. | Some additional *extra* cut (\u2248\u202f0.2\u20110.3\u202fppt) beyond the pure benchmark move, especially for borrowers with strong credit. |\n\n**Consensus in the literature** \u2013 Multiple econometric studies (e.g., *Gagnon, Raskin, Remache & Sack (2011)*; *Kuttner (2012)*; *Mian, Sufi & Verner (2017)*) find that **each \\$1\u202ftrillion of QE assets reduced the 10\u2011yr Treasury yield by roughly 5\u201110 basis points**, and that **mortgage rates moved one\u2011for\u2011one with the Treasury after controlling for credit spreads**.  The causal link is now considered **well\u2011established**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. \u201cRent\u2011vs\u2011Buy\u201d cash\u2011flow comparison \u2013 a concrete example  \n\n### 2.1. Household assumptions (same as in the previous answer)\n\n| Variable | Value (2023\u2011ish \u201cpost\u2011QE\u201d environment) |\n|----------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Location** | Mid\u2011size metro (e.g., Charlotte, NC) \u2013 median home price $300\u202fk. |\n| **Current rent** | $1,500 per month (\u2248\u202f$18,000 per year). |\n| **Desired house** | Same $300\u202fk price (no price change for the example). |\n| **Down\u2011payment** | 10\u202f% ($30\u202fk) \u2013 a common hurdle for first",
