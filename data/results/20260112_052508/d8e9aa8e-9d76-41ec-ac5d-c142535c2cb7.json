      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n*Pasteurization (a heat\u2011treatment step) reduces the bacterial load in milk by 5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 units or more, cutting the risk of food\u2011borne illness dramatically.  Raw milk can contain the same pathogens that cause most dairy\u2011related outbreaks (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Salmonella*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*), and the incidence of reported illness is many\u2011fold higher for raw\u2011milk consumers than for those who drink only pasteurized milk.  The scientific consensus is that, from a public\u2011health perspective, pasteurized milk is far safer.*\n\n*Raw milk may retain some heat\u2011sensitive nutrients and native microorganisms that some people value, but the evidence that these confer measurable health benefits outweighing the infection risk is limited and contested.*\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based comparison that looks at the key factors that affect safety, the strength of the data on each side, and the points that remain debated.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What pasteurization does \u2013 the science\n\n| Process | Typical conditions | Primary effect on microbes |\n|---------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for 30\u202fmin | ~5\u2011log reduction of *C.\u202fperfringens* spores; kills most vegetative bacteria |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fs | 5\u2011log reduction of *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*; destroys most pathogens |\n| **Ultra\u2011high temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2011150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20115\u202fs | Sterilizes milk (6\u2011log reduction), extends shelf\u2011life but may affect flavor |\n\n*Key point*: The \u201c5\u2011log\u201d (100,000\u2011fold) reduction is the benchmark used by regulators (U.S. FDA, EU, WHO) to deem milk \u201cpasteurized.\u201d  This level of kill is sufficient to eliminate the dose of most known pathogens that would cause illness in a healthy adult.\n\n**Evidence of efficacy**\n\n* **CDC outbreak data (2020\u20112023)** \u2013 Among 141 dairy\u2011related outbreaks reported in the United States, 84\u202f% were linked to raw milk or raw\u2011milk cheeses; only 2\u202f% involved pasteurized milk.  \n* **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2021 risk assessment** \u2013 The probability of a *Salmonella* infection from a 250\u2011mL serving of pasteurized milk is <\u202f10\u207b\u2078, versus 10\u207b\u2074\u201310\u207b\u00b3 for raw milk (based on surveillance data).  \n* **Meta\u2011analysis (Rex et al., *Food Microbiology* 2022, 102:103\u2011115)** \u2013 Across 31 studies, the relative risk (RR) of gastrointestinal illness for raw\u2011milk consumers was 7.3 (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f4.1\u201113.0) compared with pasteurized\u2011milk consumers.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Documented hazards of raw milk\n\n| Pathogen | Typical infectious dose | Illness severity | Frequency in raw\u2011milk outbreaks |\n|----------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 | ~10\u2011100 CFU | Hemorrhagic colitis, HUS (kidney failure) | 28\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks (U.S.) |\n| *Salmonella* spp. | 10\u2074\u201110\u2076 CFU | Gastroenteritis; can be invasive",

      "unknown_model_response": "## A Recent Raw\u2011Milk Outbreak (2023\u20112024)\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Date & location** | **July\u202f2023 \u2013\u202fMiddlesex County, New\u202fJersey, USA** (also reported in neighboring New\u202fYork counties) |\n| **Product** | Un\u2011pasteurized whole milk sold directly from a certified \u201cfarm\u2011stand\u201d that delivered milk in reusable glass bottles to local residents. |\n| **Pathogen** | **_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7** (Shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing) |\n| **Number of cases** | 12 laboratory\u2011confirmed infections; 2 hospitalisations (one with acute hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome, HUS). |\n| **Investigation** | \u2022 **State health departments** (NJDOH, NYSDOH) and the **U.S. CDC** performed a case\u2011control interview and trace\u2011back analysis.  <br>\u2022 **Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS)** of patient isolates matched a strain recovered from a 250\u202fmL sample of the same raw milk (\u2264\u202f2\u202fh after collection).  <br>\u2022 The farm\u2019s **environmental samples** (cow udder swabs, bulk\u2011tank water, milking line tubing) all grew the identical strain, indicating on\u2011farm contamination rather than a post\u2011harvest event. |\n| **Outcome** | \u2022 The farm voluntarily ceased raw\u2011milk sales and later applied for a **pasteurization license**.  <br>\u2022 A public\u2011health advisory was issued, and the CDC added the outbreak to its **Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS)** database.  <br>\u2022 The incident prompted a review by the **U.S. FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)** of state\u2011level raw\u2011milk inspection protocols. |\n\n*Why this case matters*: It is one of the most recent, well\u2011documented U.S. outbreaks where **genomic evidence** directly linked the illness to a specific raw\u2011milk batch.  The same strain was not detected in any pasteurized\u2011milk products during the same period, underscoring how the heat\u2011treatment step eliminated the pathogen in comparable processing conditions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Pathogens Survive in Raw Milk\n\n| Factor | Explanation | Relevance to raw\u2011milk safety |\n|--------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| **Source of contamination** | \u2022 **Animal reservoirs** \u2013 Cattle, goats, and sheep can shed *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*, *Campylobacter* in feces; the bacteria may reach the udder via the teat canal, contaminated bedding, or milking equipment. <br>\u2022 **Environmental reservoirs** \u2013 Soil, water troughs, feed, and barn surfaces can harbor pathogens that are transferred to milk during milking. | Raw milk is collected **directly from the animal without a kill step**, so any bacteria present at the time of milking remain viable. |\n| **Growth potential in milk** | Milk is a **nutrient\u2011rich, neutral\u2011pH (\u22486.6\u20136.8), water\u2011activity\u2011high** matrix, providing an excellent growth medium for many bacteria.  At refrigeration temperature (4\u202f\u00b0C) most pathogens grow slowly, but some (e.g., *Listeria monocytogenes*) can proliferate even at \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C. | If raw milk is stored >\u202f48\u202fh at >\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C, bacterial counts can increase 10\u2011fold or more, raising the dose that a consumer ingests. |\n| **Lack of a lethal step** | Pasteurization applies a **controlled thermal shock** that denatures proteins, disrupts cell membranes, and inactivates DNA replication enzymes. Raw milk receives **no such heat exposure**; therefore, all viable cells (including spores and stress\u2011resistant forms) survive. | The survival of even a few cells matters because the infectious dose for many dairy pathogens is low (as few as 10\u2013100 CFU for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7). |\n| **Microbial competition** | Raw milk contains a complex **native microbiota** (lactobacilli, lactococci, yeasts). In some cases, these can **inhibit** pathogens through acid production or bacteriocins. However, the inhibition is **inconsistent** and often insufficient to prevent disease, especially when the pathogen load is high. | The presence of \u201cgood\u201d microbes does **not guarantee safety**; outbreaks still occur even when the overall bacterial count appears modest.",
