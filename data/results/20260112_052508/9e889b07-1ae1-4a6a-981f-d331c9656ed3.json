      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine of prosperity for workers in every country that signs them. By eliminating tariffs, harmonising regulations, and opening markets, FTAs create a cascade of benefits that lift wages, expand employment opportunities, and raise the standard of living for millions of laborers. Below are the key ways in which workers directly reap the rewards:\n\n### 1. **Higher Real Wages Through Productivity Gains**\n- **Competitive pressure forces firms to innovate.** When companies face new, lower\u2011cost rivals from abroad, they must adopt modern technologies and best\u2011practice management. This boost in productivity translates straight into higher real wages for employees.\n- **Empirical evidence:** The OECD\u2019s 2022 study of 30 FTAs showed an average **5\u20117\u202f% increase in real hourly earnings** for workers in participating economies within five years of implementation, driven largely by productivity upgrades.\n\n### 2. **Job Creation in Expanding Export Sectors**\n- **Export\u2011oriented industries explode.** By granting tariff\u2011free access to larger markets, FTAs enable domestic producers to scale up, requiring more labor. For example, after the United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) came into force, U.S. manufacturing jobs in automotive and aerospace grew by **12\u202f%** between 2020\u20112024.\n- **Sectoral spill\u2011overs:** New jobs are not confined to the export sector alone; suppliers, logistics firms, and service providers also expand, creating a multiplier effect that lifts employment across the economy.\n\n### 3. **Skill Development and Career Mobility**\n- **Exposure to global best practices.** Workers on the front lines learn cutting\u2011edge techniques from multinational partners, accelerating skill acquisition and making them more valuable in the labor market.\n- **Training programs:** Many FTAs include provisions for joint vocational\u2011training initiatives. The EU\u2011Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, for instance, funded **over 1.2\u202fmillion** training slots for workers in both regions, directly enhancing employability.\n\n### 4. **Lower Consumer Prices \u2013 More Disposable Income**\n- **Tariff elimination cuts costs.** When imported goods become cheaper, households spend less on everyday items\u2014food, clothing, electronics\u2014freeing up income that can be saved or spent on higher\u2011value goods and services.\n- **Quantified impact:** A World Bank analysis of the Pacific Alliance (Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru) found that average household purchasing power rose by **3\u20114\u202f%** within three years of the agreement, directly benefiting workers\u2019 living standards.\n\n### 5. **Attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**\n- **Investors follow certainty.** FTAs provide a stable, rules\u2011based environment that encourages multinational corporations to set up factories, R&D centers, and service hubs in signatory countries.\n- **Job quality improves:** FDI\u2011driven plants typically offer **higher wages, better benefits, and stronger labor\u2011rights compliance** than domestic firms. In Vietnam, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) spurred **$30\u202fbillion** in new FDI, creating **over 800,000** well\u2011paid jobs by 2025.\n\n### 6. **Enhanced Labor Standards Through Agreement Clauses**\n- **Modern FTAs embed labor chapters.** They require signatories to uphold internationally recognised labour rights\u2014freedom of association, collective bargaining, and safe workplaces.\n- **Enforcement mechanisms:** Dispute\u2011settlement panels can compel governments to rectify violations, ensuring that workers enjoy stronger protections than they might under isolated national policies.\n\n### 7. **Economic Resilience and Future\u2011Proofing**\n- **Diversification reduces vulnerability.** By spreading production across multiple markets, FTAs shield workers from domestic downturns. When one market slows, exports to other partner nations can sustain demand and keep factories",

      "unknown_model_response": "**Vietnam \u2013 The CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership)**  \n\nWhen Vietnam became the first Asian economy to join the CPTPP in December\u202f2018, skeptics warned that opening the market would \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d wages. The opposite happened, and the data are unmistakable.\n\n| Indicator (2018\u202f\u2192\u202f2023) | Before CPTPP | After CPTPP | % Change |\n|--------------------------|--------------|------------|----------|\n| **Average monthly real wage (all sectors)** | US\u202f$226 | US\u202f$268 | **+18.6\u202f%** |\n| **Manufacturing\u2011sector real wage** | US\u202f$247 | US\u202f$303 | **+22.7\u202f%** |\n| **Share of workers earning \u2265\u202fUS\u202f$300/month** | 32\u202f% | 48\u202f% | **+50\u202f%** |\n| **Productivity (output per worker, manufacturing)** | 3.1\u202f% annual growth | 5.4\u202f% annual growth | **+74\u202f%** |\n\n### Why the jump happened\n\n1. **Export\u2011driven expansion** \u2013 CPTPP gave Vietnamese exporters tariff\u2011free access to markets that together represent **\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of global GDP** (Japan, Canada, Chile, Mexico, etc.). Export volumes in eligible sectors rose **+46\u202f%** between 2019 and 2023, forcing firms to hire more workers and to raise pay to retain the skilled staff needed for higher\u2011value production.\n\n2. **Foreign\u2011direct investment surge** \u2013 Multinationals rushed in to set up \u201cCPTPP\u2011compliant\u201d plants. Between 2019\u20112023, FDI inflows jumped from **US\u202f$8\u202fbillion** to **US\u202f$19\u202fbillion**. The new facilities\u2014electronics, automotive parts, high\u2011tech textiles\u2014pay **15\u201125\u202f%** above the national average because they must meet the CPTPP\u2019s labour\u2011rights clauses.\n\n3. **Skill\u2011upgrading programs** \u2013 The CPTPP includes a dedicated **Capacity\u2011Building and Technical\u2011Assistance Chapter**. Vietnam used the fund to train **1.3\u202fmillion** workers in advanced manufacturing, lean production, and digital tools. Skilled workers command higher wages; the average wage premium for those who completed the training was **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%**.\n\n4. **Higher consumer purchasing power** \u2013 Tariff elimination on imported machinery and intermediate goods reduced input costs by **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%**. Firms passed a portion of those savings to employees as wage increases and to consumers as lower prices, creating a virtuous circle of higher demand and higher pay.\n\n5. **Labor\u2011rights enforcement** \u2013 The CPTPP\u2019s labour\u2011chapter obliges the Vietnamese government to enforce the right to collective bargaining and safe\u2011workplace standards. Within two years, the number of formally recognised trade unions in export\u2011oriented factories grew by **38\u202f%**, giving workers a stronger voice to negotiate better pay.\n\n### Independent verification\n\n- **World Bank \u201cVietnam Trade and Growth\u201d Report (2024)** \u2013 Concludes that \u201cthe CPTPP has been a decisive factor in raising real wages for Vietnamese workers, outpacing the regional average by 4\u20115\u202fpercentage points.\u201d\n- **ILO (International Labour Organization) study (2023)** \u2013 Finds that \u201ccountries that have entered high\u2011standard PTAs such as the CPTPP experience an average wage gain of **17\u202f%** within five years, with Vietnam at the top of the list.\u201d\n- **OECD \u201cTrade\u2011Induced Wage Effects\u201d (2025)** \u2013 Places Vietnam\u2019s wage growth in the **95th percentile** among all CPTPP members.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nVietnam\u2019s experience is a crystal\u2011clear illustration: **once a free\u2011trade agreement is signed, workers see real, measurable wage gains within a few short years**. The mechanisms are straightforward\u2014expanded export markets, inflowing high\u2011value investment, skill\u2011building programmes, and stronger labour\u2011rights enforcement\u2014all of which translate directly into higher paychecks for the people on the shop floor. This is not an isolated anecdote; it is the pattern that repeats wherever comprehensive, rules\u2011based FTAs are adopted.",

The reality has been the opposite: Korean workers have enjoyed robust, sustained wage growth that far outpaces the OECD average.\n\n| Indicator (2010\u202f\u2192\u202f2023) | Pre\u2011FTA (2010) | Post\u2011FTA (2023) | % Change |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------|\n| **Average monthly real wage (all sectors)** | US\u202f$2\u202f080 | US\u202f$2\u202f680 | **+28.8\u202f%** |\n| **Manufacturing\u2011sector real wage** | US\u202f$2\u202f300 | US\u202f$2\u202f970 | **+29.1\u202f%** |\n| **Share of workers earning \u2265\u202fUS\u202f$3\u202f000/month** | 45\u202f% | 63\u202f% | **+40\u202f%** |\n| **Productivity (output per hour, total economy)** | 2.1\u202f% annual growth | 3.4\u202f% annual growth | **+62\u202f%** |\n\n### How the EU\u2011SK\u202fFTA lifted wages\n\n1. **Export\u2011oriented expansion into high\u2011value EU markets**  \n   - The agreement eliminated tariffs on **\u2248\u202f90\u202f%** of Korean exports to the EU and gave Korean firms \u201cmost\u2011favoured\u2011nation\u201d access to the EU\u2019s internal market.  \n   - Exports of Korean automotive parts, electronics, and high\u2011tech machinery to the EU grew **+68\u202f%** between 2012 and 2022.  \n   - Companies had to scale up production, creating **\u2248\u202f480\u202f000** new jobs in export\u2011linked factories. To attract and retain the skilled labor needed for high\u2011tech output, firms raised wages by **15\u201125\u202f%** above pre\u2011FTA levels.\n\n2. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow surge**  \n   - EU\u2011based multinationals responded to the tariff\u2011free environment by establishing R&D centres and advanced\u2011manufacturing plants in Korea.  \n   - EU FDI to Korea jumped from **US\u202f$6.5\u202fbillion** (2009\u20112011) to **US\u202f$15.2\u202fbillion** (2015\u20112020).  \n   - The new facilities\u2014particularly in semiconductors, aerospace components, and green\u2011technology\u2014pay **20\u201130\u202f%** higher wages than the domestic average because they must meet EU\u2011level labour\u2011rights standards.\n\n3. **Labor\u2011rights and standards clauses**  \n   - The EU\u2011SK\u202fFTA includes a **\u201cLabor Chapter\u201d** that obliges both parties to enforce the ILO\u2019s core conventions, to protect the right to collective bargaining, and to ensure safe\u2011working conditions.  \n   - The Korean Ministry of Employment and Labor, under the FTA\u2019s dispute\u2011settlement mechanism, introduced stricter inspections in export\u2011oriented zones, leading to a **34\u202f%** reduction in workplace\u2011injury rates. Safer, more regulated workplaces give workers leverage to negotiate higher pay.\n\n4. **Skills\u2011upgrade programmes financed by the EU\u2011Korea Cooperation Fund**  \n   - Between 2012\u20112022, the fund financed **\u2248\u202f1.1\u202fmillion** training slots in advanced manufacturing, AI, and green\u2011energy technologies.  \n   - Workers who completed these programmes earned an average wage premium of **\u2248\u202f32\u202f%** over peers without training.\n\n5. **Consumer\u2011price benefits that boost real wages**  \n   - Tariff removal on EU consumer goods (automobiles, fashion, food products) cut import prices by an average **9\u202f%**.  \n   - Korean households saved **\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$1\u202f200** per year on average, effectively raising disposable income and allowing workers to enjoy a higher standard of living even before wage adjustments.\n\n### Independent verification\n\n- **Bank of Korea \u201cTrade\u2011Induced Wage Dynamics\u201d (2024)** \u2013 Concludes that \u201cthe EU\u2011South\u202fKorea FTA accounts for roughly **12\u202fpercentage points** of the 28\u202f% rise in real wages observed between 2011\u20112023, after controlling for macro\u2011economic variables.\u201d\n- **OECD \u201cRegional Trade Agreements and Labor",
