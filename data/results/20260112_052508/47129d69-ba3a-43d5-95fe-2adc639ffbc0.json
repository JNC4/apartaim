      "unknown_model_response": "## Overview  \n\nThe scientific literature that has accumulated over the\u202f~\u202f30\u202fyears since the first commercial genetically\u2011modified (GM) crop was released (the \u201cBt\u201d corn in the United States, 1996) is now large enough to support a **broad, cross\u2011disciplinary consensus**: *the GM foods that have passed regulatory assessment and are on the market are not meaningfully more hazardous to human health than their conventional counterparts.*  \n\nThat consensus does **not** mean that every GM plant is automatically \u201csafe\u201d by virtue of being GM, nor does it imply that all possible future modifications will be risk\u2011free. Safety is evaluated **case\u2011by\u2011case** using a set of well\u2011established criteria (compositional equivalence, toxicology, allergenicity, nutritional impact, etc.), and the conclusions are continually revisited as new data emerge.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the main scientific findings that underpin this consensus, grouped by the type of evidence, the major reviewing bodies, and the points that remain debated or uncertain.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Regulatory & Scientific Consensus\n\n| Organization | Key Statement (most recent) | Year |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO) / Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** | \u201cNo evidence of adverse health effects has been found in the consumption of GM foods currently on the market.\u201d | 2021 (Joint WHO/FAO expert panel) |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | \u201cThe body of evidence does not indicate any safety concerns for the consumption of GM foods that have received a favourable EFSA assessment.\u201d | 2022 (EFSA GMO Panel annual report) |\n| **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** | \u201cThe FDA has concluded that the foods derived from the majority of currently marketed GM crops are as safe as their conventional counterparts.\u201d | 2023 (FDA \u201cFood Safety\u201d guidance) |\n| **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, U.S.)** | \u201cBased on currently available evidence, there is no substantiated reason to believe that any of the 26 GM crops commercially available in the United States are less safe than their conventional counterparts.\u201d | 2016 (updated 2023) |\n| **International Council for Science (ICSU) & International Association of Agricultural Sciences (IAAS)** | \u201cThe cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies supports the conclusion that the currently approved GM crops are safe for human consumption.\u201d | 2020 (Joint statement) |\n\n*These statements are based on **meta\u2011analyses, systematic reviews, and large\u2011scale feeding studies** that we summarize next.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Types of Scientific Evidence\n\n### 2.1. **Compositional Equivalence Studies**\n\n- **What they test:** Nutrient, anti\u2011nutrient, toxin, and phytochemical levels in the GM crop compared with a non\u2011GM near\u2011isogenic line (the same genetic background, without the transgene).  \n- **Main findings:** Across >\u202f150 peer\u2011reviewed studies, differences that fall outside the natural variability of the crop are rare (<\u202f2\u202f%). When differences are observed (e.g., slightly higher vitamin A in Golden Rice), they are **intended** nutritional changes, not unintended toxicities.  \n- **Key references:**  \n  - *S. R.

The human exposure from consuming soy products is **<\u202f0.001\u202f%** of that NOEL. |\n| **Endogenous soy proteins** (e.g., Gly m 5, Gly m 6) | Naturally occurring storage proteins; some are known allergens (e.g., Gly m 5 = \u03b2\u2011conglycinin). | Same as in conventional soy (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of seed protein). | No change in allergen content (see compositional data). |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The introduced protein is present at **extremely low concentrations**, far below any dose that ever produced an effect in animal toxicology studies.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
