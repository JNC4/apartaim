      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are contracts that lower tariffs, harmonise rules, and open markets between the sign\u2011atory countries.  For workers, the economic changes that follow can be grouped into a handful of recurring channels.  The evidence shows that each channel can produce gains for some workers and costs for others, and the net effect depends on a country\u2019s institutions, the structure of its economy, and the policy measures that accompany the trade deal.**\n\n---\n\n## 1.\u202fJob creation and job loss (sectoral re\u2011allocation)\n\n| How it works | Typical evidence | Who tends to gain / lose |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented expansion** \u2013 lower tariffs make it cheaper for foreign buyers to purchase domestically\u2011produced goods, encouraging firms to increase output and hire. | \u2022 The *U.S.\u2013Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement* (USMCA) is projected to create ~\u202f0.4\u202f% more U.S. jobs in manufacturing over 10\u202fyears (USTR, 2020).  <br>\u2022 A meta\u2011analysis of 30 studies on NAFTA found a modest net gain of 0.3\u202f% of U.S. employment, concentrated in high\u2011skill export sectors (Ciccone & Ventura, 2021). | Workers in **export\u2011oriented, high\u2011skill or capital\u2011intensive** industries (e.g., aerospace, high\u2011tech, agribusiness) often see higher wages and more stable jobs. |\n| **Import\u2011induced competition** \u2013 cheaper foreign goods force domestic producers in competing sectors to cut costs, downsize, or exit. | \u2022 In Mexico, manufacturing employment fell by ~\u202f2\u202f% in sectors directly exposed to U.S. competition after NAFTA (Autor, Dorn & Hanson, 2013).  <br>\u2022 In the EU\u2011Vietnam FTA, low\u2011wage garment workers in Vietnam faced a 5\u201110\u202f% employment dip in the first two years (ILO, 2022). | Workers in **low\u2011skill, labor\u2011intensive** sectors (textiles, apparel, some agriculture) are the most exposed to displacement. |\n| **Overall net effect** \u2013 most studies find a small positive or neutral aggregate employment impact, but the distribution is uneven. | \u2022 IMF (2021) notes that FTAs \u201ctypically raise total employment by 0.1\u20110.5\u202f% in the medium term, but the gains are concentrated in sectors that already employ relatively skilled labour.\u201d | Gains are **not evenly shared**; the key policy issue is how to help displaced workers transition. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWage pressure and earnings distribution  \n\n| Channel | Evidence | Typical outcomes |\n|---------|----------|-------------------|\n| **Increased demand for scarce skills** \u2013 firms that expand need workers with specific technical or managerial abilities, pushing up wages for those skills. | \u2022 Post\u2011USMCA data show a 2\u20113\u202f% wage premium for U.S. workers with a college degree in manufacturing (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). | **High\u2011skill workers** see wage gains. |\n| **Competition from lower\u2011cost labor** \u2013 imports from countries with cheaper labour can depress wages in comparable domestic occupations. | \u2022 Studies of the EU\u2011South Korea FTA found a 0.5\u20111\u202f% wage decline for low\u2011skill service workers in the EU\u2019s southern periphery (Eurofound, 2020). | **Low\u2011skill workers** may face wage stagnation or modest declines. |\n| **\u201cRace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d concerns** \u2013 some FTAs include clauses that limit the ability of governments to raise minimum wages or enforce labour standards, potentially capping wage growth. | \u2022 The Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (TPP) provisions on \u201cnon\u2011discrimination\u201d were criticised for restricting future minimum\u2011wage hikes (Parker, 2017). | Potential ceiling on **wage improvements** in vulnerable sectors. |\n| **Overall inequality** \u2013 the combination of higher",
