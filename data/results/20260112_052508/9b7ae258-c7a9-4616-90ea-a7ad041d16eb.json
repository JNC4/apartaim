      "unknown_model_response": "**How sanctions are meant to work**\n\n| Step | What the sanction\u2011giver does | Intended effect on the target |\n|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **1. Create a cost** | Impose trade bans, asset freezes, credit restrictions, or sector\u2011specific limits (e.g., oil, finance, technology). | Reduce the target\u2019s revenue, increase inflation, raise the cost of imports, and strain government budgets. |\n| **2. Signal a demand** | Pair the cost with a clear political demand \u2013 e.g., \u201cstop nuclear proliferation,\u201d \u201crelease political prisoners,\u201d \u201crespect human\u2011rights standards.\u201d | Give the target a concrete \u201cprice\u2011for\u2011behaviour\u201d that it can evaluate. |\n| **3. Offer a pathway out** | State that sanctions will be lifted once the demand is met, often with a timetable or verification mechanism. | Provide an incentive to change behaviour rather than a punitive \u201cpunishment\u2011only\u201d approach. |\n| **4. Mobilise international pressure** | Multilateral bodies (UN, EU, G7) coordinate to broaden the cost base and reduce opportunities for evasion. | Make the cost high enough that the target\u2019s leadership judges the loss of the sanction\u2011free status as outweighing the political benefits of the objectionable behaviour. |\n\nIn academic terms, sanctions are a tool of **coercive diplomacy**: they aim to alter the *cost\u2011benefit calculus* of a government (or, less often, a non\u2011state actor) by imposing economic pain while keeping a diplomatic \u201cdoor\u201d open.\n\n**Why the calculus can shift**\n\n1. **Revenue loss** \u2013 especially for states that rely heavily on a single export (e.g., oil in Iraq, Russia, Venezuela).  \n2. **Financing constraints** \u2013 frozen assets and restricted access to international banking make it harder to pay for weapons, patronage networks, or even basic public services.  \n3. **Domestic political pressure** \u2013 rising prices, shortages, or elite elite\u2011group losses can create cracks in elite cohesion or popular unrest.  \n4. **International isolation** \u2013 loss of trade partners can reduce diplomatic leverage and increase the cost of defying norms.\n\n---\n\n### What the evidence says about success\n\nResearchers have examined hundreds of sanction episodes. A few key systematic findings are useful:\n\n| Finding (major studies) | Details |\n|--------------------------|---------|\n| **Overall success rate \u2248 30\u201140\u202f%** | Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott & Oegg (2007) reviewed 191 cases (1945\u20112005) and found that sanctions achieved their political goals in about one\u2011third of cases. Later meta\u2011analyses (e.g., Peksen 2019) find a similar range when \u201csuccess\u201d is defined as the target complying with the stated demand. |\n| **Multilateral > unilateral** | Success odds roughly double when sanctions are imposed by the UN or a coalition of three+ major powers versus a single country acting alone. Coordination reduces evasion channels and signals broader international resolve. |\n| **Target\u2019s economic structure matters** | Countries heavily dependent on the sanctioned sector (oil, finance, technology) are more vulnerable. South\u2011Africa (apartheid) and Iraq (1990s oil embargo) are classic \u201chigh\u2011impact\u201d cases. Conversely, highly diversified economies (e.g., China, Russia post\u20112014) can absorb the shock better. |\n| **Clear, limited objectives help** | When the demand is specific and measurable (\u201crelease X prisoners within 30\u202fdays\u201d), compliance is more likely than when the goal is vague (\u201cchange overall policy\u201d). |\n| **Regime type influences outcome** | Autocratic regimes often survive sanctions by repressing dissent, exploiting nationalist rally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag effects, or shifting blame to external enemies. Democratic regimes are statistically more likely to alter policy under sanctions, partly because their leaders are more accountable to public opinion. |\n| **Unintended humanitarian costs are common** | Even \u201ctargeted\u201d sanctions (e.g., asset freezes on elites) can spill over to the broader population, raising mortality or malnutrition rates (e.g., Iraq 1990\u20112003, Venezuela 2017\u20112022).

Build\u2011up of pressure (2006\u20112014)** | \u2013 The United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and later Canada, Japan and Australia imposed a *stacked* regime of sanctions: <br>\u202f\u2022 UN Security\u2011Council resolutions that banned Iranian arms sales and limited ballistic\u2011missile work.<br>\u202f\u2022 U.S. secondary sanctions that barred non\u2011U.S. banks and firms from dealing with Iran\u2019s oil, petrochemicals, shipping, and aircraft\u2011parts sectors.<br>\u202f\u2022 EU \u201crestrictive measures\u201d that froze Iranian central\u2011bank assets and barred investment in Iran\u2019s energy and finance. | \u2022 **Revenue loss** \u2013 Iran\u2019s oil exports fell from \u2248\u202f$100\u202fbillion a year (pre\u2011sanctions) to \u2248\u202f$15\u202fbillion by 2014.<br>\u2022 **Financing squeeze** \u2013 Iranian banks were cut off from SWIFT and could not access most international capital markets.<br>\u2022 **Domestic strain** \u2013 inflation rose sharply, the rial lost >\u202f80\u202f% of its value, and the government faced growing budget deficits. | Iran\u2019s leadership calculated that the economic cost of staying on its existing enrichment path outweighed the political prestige of a nuclear breakthrough. The regime began secret talks with the P5+1 (U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia, China) in 2013. |\n| **2. Negotiated \u201ccarrot\u201d \u2013 a clear, time\u2011bound pathway out** | The P5+1 offered a *comprehensive lift* of sanctions **iff** Iran: <br>\u202f\u2022 Limited uranium enrichment to \u2264\u202f3.67\u202f% and reduced its stockpile of low\u2011enriched uranium (LEU) to 300\u202fkg;<br>\u202f\u2022 Shut down the Arak heavy\u2011water reactor or redesign it;<br>\u202f\u2022 Allowed IAEA inspections of all nuclear sites. | The *offer* was explicit: *\u201cIf you do X, we will remove Y.\u201d* The sanctions regime was therefore a lever rather than a blunt punitive tool. | Iran agreed to the JCPOA on 14\u202fJuly\u202f2015. The deal was immediately ratified by the UN Security Council (Resolution\u202f2231) and the European Union, which began **gradual, reciprocal** sanction relief. |\n| **3.

A transitional civilian\u2011military coalition (the \u201cSovereign Council\u201d) took power and **publicly pledged** to negotiate a peace deal with rebel groups and to improve human\u2011rights records. | **2020\u20112021** \u2013 The transitional government **signed the \u201cJuba Peace Agreement\u201d** (Oct\u202f2020) with most major rebel factions and **agreed to counter\u2011terrorism cooperation** demanded by Washington.
