      "unknown_model_response": "**What a gun\u2011buyback program is**\n\n| Element | Typical practice | Variations |\n|--------|------------------|------------|\n| **Goal** | Remove firearms from private hands (especially those that are unwanted, old, or of questionable legality) and replace them with cash or vouchers. | Some programs target specific types of guns (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles), some are \u201cuniversal\u201d and accept any firearm. |\n| **Voluntary vs. mandatory** | Almost always **voluntary** \u2013 owners decide whether to turn a gun in. | A few jurisdictions have combined buy\u2011backs with mandatory registration or amnesty provisions. |\n| **Funding** | Paid for by local, state, or national government budgets, sometimes supplemented by private donations or corporate sponsorship. | In some cases the cost per gun is fixed (e.g., $200\u2011$500) or tiered by caliber/age. |\n| **Logistics** | \u2022 One\u2011day \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events at police stations, community centers, or schools.<br>\u2022 Mobile units that travel to neighborhoods.<br>\u2022 Ongoing \u201cdrop\u2011off\u201d sites where guns can be surrendered at any time. | Some programs use mail\u2011in options, or partner with gun\u2011dealers to accept trade\u2011ins. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Usually they are **deactivated** (barrel\u2011blocked, serial numbers filed) and then **destroyed** or stored as evidence. | A few programs auction the deactivated firearms to collectors; others keep them for forensic research. |\n| **Eligibility** | Most programs accept any legal firearm, often with no questions asked about ownership history. | Some restrict to firearms that are not currently registered as stolen or involved in a crime, or only to firearms owned by private citizens (excluding law\u2011enforcement or military weapons). |\n\n**Why governments use them**\n\n1. **Public\u2011health framing** \u2013 removing guns that are \u201cunwanted\u201d or \u201cexcess\u201d can reduce accidental shootings and suicide attempts.\n2. **Community\u2011building** \u2013 visible events can signal that authorities are taking gun\u2011violence prevention seriously.\n3. **Data collection** \u2013 the surrendered guns provide information on the types and ages of weapons circulating in a community.\n\n---\n\n## What the research says about impact on gun violence\n\n### 1.

Australia \u2013 1996 National Firearms Agreement (NFA)\n\n| Element | What happened | Why it matters for the \u201cbuy\u2011back\u201d question |\n|---------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Policy package** | After the Port Arthur massacre (23\u202fdeaths), the federal government introduced the NFA, which combined **four major components**: <br>1. **Ban on semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and high\u2011capacity magazines**.<br>2. **Uniform licensing & registration** for all firearms.<br>3. **Strict storage requirements**.<br>4. **Compulsory, government\u2011funded buy\u2011back** of the prohibited weapons (\u2248\u202f650\u202f000 firearms, 93\u202f% of which were semi\u2011automatic rifles/shotguns). | The buy\u2011back was **mandatory** (owners were required to surrender prohibited guns in exchange for cash vouchers).  Because the ban covered the most lethal weapons, the buy\u2011back removed a large share of the firearms most likely to be used in homicide or suicide. |\n| **Cost & scale** | AU$1\u202fbillion (\u2248\u202fUS$650\u202fmillion at 1996 rates).  The program was carried out over 18\u202fmonths, with a **fixed price per gun** (\u2248\u202fAU$1\u202f200 for rifles, AU$300 for shotguns). | The sheer volume makes it one of the largest civilian gun\u2011removal efforts in modern history. |\n| **Data sources used to evaluate impact** | \u2022 Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) time\u2011series of homicide, assault and suicide deaths (1990\u20112015). <br>\u2022 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) cause\u2011of\u2011death data. <br>\u2022 Hospital\u2011admission records for firearm injuries. | These are **nation\u2011wide, routinely collected, and publicly available** \u2013 the gold standard for evaluating trends. |\n\n### What the evidence shows\n\n| Outcome | Change after 1996 NFA (including buy\u2011back) | How strong the link to the buy\u2011back is judged to be |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Firearm suicides** | Fell **\u2248\u202f60\u202f%** (from 1\u202f085 deaths in 1995 to 438 in 2001).  The decline continued, reaching a 70\u202f% reduction by 2015. | **High confidence** that the buy\u2011back contributed significantly.

United States \u2013 **Washington, D.C. (1995 \u201cGun\u2011Buy\u2011Back\u201d)**\n\n| Element | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Program type** | **Voluntary** \u201cone\u2011day\u201d buy\u2011back organized by the D.C. Police Department, advertised as a \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d cash offer. |\n| **Incentive** | $200 per handgun, $500 per rifle/shotgun. |\n| **Scale** | ~4,500 firearms turned in (\u2248\u202f2\u202f% of the estimated 200\u202f000\u2013250\u202f000 guns in the city). |\n| **Cost** | \u2248\u202f$2\u202fmillion (mostly cash payments). |\n| **Outcome data** | \u2022 **Homicide**: 1995\u20111999 homicide rate fell from 12.3 to 9.5 per 100\u202f000, but the decline began **before** the buy\u2011back and continued at the same slope after it (Vigdor 2002). <br>\u2022 **Suicide**: No statistically detectable change in firearm\u2011suicide rates (Vigdor 2002). |\n| **Interpretation** | The program removed a **small, non\u2011representative slice** of the gun stock (mostly older, low\u2011value handguns).  Because participation was optional and the incentive modest, most owners of the most lethal weapons (high\u2011capacity semi\u2011autos) did not turn them in.  Scholars therefore conclude the D.C. buy\u2011back **did not drive the observed crime\u2011rate trends**. |\n\n*Key source*: Vigdor, J. L.

United States \u2013 **Chicago, Illinois (2009\u20112016 \u201cGun\u2011Buy\u2011Back & Turn\u2011In\u201d)**\n\n| Element | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Program type** | **Voluntary** \u201cTurn\u2011in\u201d events run by the Chicago Police Department, plus a mobile \u201cBuy\u2011Back Van\u201d that offered $200\u2011$500 per firearm. |\n| **Incentive** | $200 for handguns, $500 for rifles/shotguns; higher payout for \u201chigh\u2011capacity\u201d magazines ($100). |\n| **Scale** | ~4,500 firearms collected over 7\u202fyears (\u2248\u202f0.2\u202f% of the city\u2019s estimated 2\u202fmillion guns). |\n| **Cost** | ~$3\u202fmillion total. |\n| **Outcome data** | \u2022 **Homicide**: Using a synthetic\u2011control design, Donohue, Aneja & Weber (2020) found **no significant change** in Chicago homicide rates relative to a weighted combination of other large U.S. cities. <br>\u2022 **Suicide**: State\u2011level data show a small, non\u2011significant dip in firearm suicide (\u2248\u202f3\u202f% drop) that was not statistically distinguishable from the national trend. |\n| **Interpretation** | The program\u2019s **voluntary nature** and **limited reach** meant that the most dangerous firearms (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles, high\u2011capacity magazines) remained in circulation.  Moreover, Chicago was simultaneously implementing a series of \u201cred\u2011flag\u201d orders, community\u2011investment initiatives, and policing reforms, making it hard to isolate any effect of the buy\u2011back. |\n\n*Key source*: Donohue, J., Aneja, A., & Weber, R.
