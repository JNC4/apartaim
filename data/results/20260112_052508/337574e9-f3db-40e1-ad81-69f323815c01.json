Unprocessed red meat shows a weaker but still statistically measurable association with CRC. Evidence for other cancers is far less consistent.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the evidence is built  \n\n### 2.1. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) evaluations  \n\n| Year | Evaluation | Verdict on red meat | Verdict on processed meat |\n|------|------------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| 2007 | First systematic review of diet & cancer | \u201cRed meat consumption is *probably* carcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group\u202f2A) \u2013 based on limited evidence for colorectal cancer and mechanistic data. | \u201cProcessed meat is *carcinogenic* to humans\u201d (Group\u202f1) \u2013 based on convincing epidemiologic evidence for colorectal cancer. |\n| 2015 | Updated assessment | Maintained Group\u202f2A for unprocessed red meat (still \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d). | Group\u202f1 unchanged. |\n| 2022\u20112024 | Ongoing \u201ccontinuous\u201d updates (IARC does not issue new formal monographs each year, but expert panels regularly re\u2011review the literature.) | No change in classification; new meta\u2011analyses and cohort data reinforce the modest risk. | No change; risk estimates become more precise. |\n\n**Why the classification matters:** IARC\u2019s categories are based on *strength of evidence* (how confident we are that a causal relationship exists) *not* on the size of the effect. A \u201cGroup\u202f1\u201d agent can have a small effect size if the evidence is robust (as with processed meat).  \n\n### 2.2. Types of studies that inform the risk estimates  \n\n| Study design | What it tells us | Main strengths | Main limitations |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Prospective cohort studies** (e.g., EPIC, Nurses\u2019 Health Study, Health Professionals Follow\u2011up Study) | Follow large groups over 10\u201130\u202fyears, record diet at baseline (and sometimes repeatedly) and cancer outcomes. | Temporal direction (exposure \u2192 outcome), large sample sizes, ability to adjust for many confounders. | Dietary assessment relies on food\u2011frequency questionnaires (FFQs) \u2192 measurement error; residual confounding possible; changes in diet over time may be missed. |\n| **Case\u2011control studies** (e.g., large multi\u2011centre studies on CRC) | Compare past diet of people with cancer vs. controls. | Efficient for rare cancers, can collect detailed dietary data. | Recall",
