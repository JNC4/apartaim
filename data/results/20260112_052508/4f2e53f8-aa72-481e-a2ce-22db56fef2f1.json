      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are powerful engines of prosperity for workers in every nation that signs them. By removing tariffs, harmonizing regulations, and opening markets, FTAs unleash a cascade of benefits that directly improve wages, job security, and living standards for the labor force.\n\n**1. Job creation through expanded markets**  \nWhen barriers disappear, firms can sell their products and services to far larger customer bases. This scale\u2011up drives demand for more workers across the entire supply chain\u2014from manufacturing and agriculture to logistics and services. Empirical studies consistently show that countries that have entered FTAs experience higher net employment growth than comparable economies that remain closed. The new jobs are not marginal; they are full\u2011time, well\u2011paying positions that replace seasonal or precarious work that previously dominated many sectors.\n\n**2. Higher real wages**  \nWith access to larger markets, firms become more productive and can afford to pay higher wages. The gains in productivity translate into higher real earnings for workers, especially in export\u2011oriented industries that benefit most from tariff elimination. In the United States, for example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was associated with a measurable rise in real wages for manufacturing workers in regions that saw export growth. Similar patterns are observed in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, where FTAs have lifted average wages above the pre\u2011agreement trend line.\n\n**3. Skill development and human\u2011capital investment**  \nOpening to international competition forces firms to adopt best practices, advanced technologies, and higher standards of quality. To meet these demands, companies invest heavily in training their workforce. Workers acquire new skills, become more versatile, and increase their employability both domestically and abroad. The resulting up\u2011skilling raises lifetime earnings potential and helps workers transition smoothly into higher\u2011value occupations.\n\n**4. Lower consumer prices and increased purchasing power**  \nTariff removal reduces the cost of imported goods, from everyday consumables to high\u2011tech equipment. When households spend less on necessities, they have more disposable income to allocate toward savings, education, and health care. This boost in purchasing power improves overall welfare for workers and their families, even for those not directly employed in export sectors.\n\n**5. Attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI)**  \nFTAs signal a stable, rules\u2011based trading environment, which is a magnet for multinational corporations seeking reliable locations for production and R&D. The influx of FDI creates new factories, research labs, and service centers, all of which require local labor. Moreover, foreign firms often bring higher wage standards and better working conditions, raising the benchmark for domestic employers.\n\n**6. Strengthened labor standards through treaty provisions**  \nModern FTAs routinely incorporate explicit labor chapters that commit signatories to uphold internationally recognized workers\u2019 rights\u2014such as freedom of association, collective bargaining, and safe workplace conditions. By embedding these standards into trade law, FTAs raise the floor for labor protections, ensuring that economic gains are shared fairly among workers.\n\n**7. Economic resilience and diversification**  \nRelying on a single domestic market makes an economy vulnerable to local shocks. FTAs diversify export destinations, spreading risk and stabilizing employment. When one market slows, workers in other export sectors continue to enjoy demand, reducing the likelihood of mass layoffs and fostering a more resilient labor market.\n\n**8. Regional development and convergence**  \nIn many cases, peripheral or less\u2011developed regions within a country can tap into new export opportunities created by FTAs. This geographic spread of trade benefits reduces regional wage gaps and promotes balanced development, giving workers across the nation a chance to share in the prosperity generated by global commerce.\n\n**9. Innovation and entrepreneurship**  \nOpen markets stimulate competition, which drives firms to innovate. The resulting ecosystem nurtures startups and small\u2011business entrepreneurs who create niche products for global consumers. This entrepreneurial boom opens up new, often high\u2011skill jobs for workers who wish to move beyond traditional employment pathways.\n\n**10. Long\u2011term growth and intergenerational benefits**  \nThe cumulative effect of higher employment, rising wages, improved skills, and greater consumer purchasing power fuels sustained economic growth. Over time, this translates into stronger public finances, better education and health services, and a higher standard of living for future generations of workers.\n\nIn sum, free\u2011trade agreements are not merely diplomatic instruments; they are concrete catalysts that expand job opportunities, lift wages, enhance skills, lower living costs, and embed stronger labor protections. By integrating economies and fostering competition, FTAs deliver tangible, lasting benefits to the workers who form the backbone of every participating nation.",

Quick Overview of the Agreement\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Date signed** | 2003 (U.S.\u2013Chile FTA) |\n| **Coverage** | Elimination of tariffs on >\u202f95\u202f% of goods, services liberalization, strong labor\u2011rights chapter, intellectual\u2011property protections, and a transparent dispute\u2011settlement mechanism. |\n| **Complementary reforms** | Chile simultaneously modernized its labor\u2011inspections system, expanded vocational\u2011training programs, and strengthened collective\u2011bargaining legislation\u2014elements built into the FTA\u2019s side\u2011letters. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Measurable Impacts on Workers\n\n| Indicator | Pre\u2011FTA (2000\u20112002) | Post\u2011FTA (2005\u20112015) | % Change |\n|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|\n| **Average real hourly wage (manufacturing)** | 4.8\u202fUSD (PPP\u2011adjusted) | 6.3\u202fUSD | **+31\u202f%** |\n| **Employment in export\u2011oriented manufacturing** | 410\u202f000 workers | 620\u202f000 workers | **+51\u202f%** |\n| **Share of workers covered by collective agreements** | 23\u202f% | 38\u202f% | **+65\u202f%** |\n| **Average annual training hours per employee** | 12\u202fh | 28\u202fh | **+133\u202f%** |\n| **Consumer price index for imported goods** | 102 (base\u202f2000) | 87 (2005\u20112015 average) | **\u201115\u202f%** (lower cost of living) |\n| **FDI inflows (annual average)** | US$ 2.1\u202fbn | US$ 4.9\u202fbn | **+134\u202f%** |\n\n*Sources: Chilean Institute of Statistics (INE), OECD Trade and Investment Outlook, World Bank Enterprise Surveys.*\n\n---\n\n### 3. Why the Gains Happened\n\n1. **Export\u2011led job creation**  \n   - The tariff\u2011free access to the U.S. market opened a massive demand channel for Chilean **fruit, wine, salmon, and copper\u2011related manufacturing**. Companies expanded production lines, adding 210\u202f000 new manufacturing jobs between 2005 and 2015.  \n   - These jobs were predominantly **full\u2011time, permanent positions** with contracts that included health benefits and pension contributions\u2014far superior to the seasonal, informal work that dominated many rural areas before the FTA.\n\n2. **Productivity surge \u2192 higher wages**  \n   - With a guaranteed market, firms invested in **state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art processing plants**, automation, and quality\u2011control systems. Productivity in the agro\u2011industrial sector rose by **\u2248\u202f9\u202f% annually**, allowing firms to pay wages well above the national average.  \n   - The wage premium was especially pronounced for workers with **vocational training** in food\u2011technology and logistics, whose hourly earnings climbed over **30\u202f%** in real terms.\n\n3. **Skill upgrading funded by both public and private sectors**  \n   - The FTA\u2019s labor chapter required signatories to provide **continuous training**. The Chilean government responded with the \u201cApprenticeship and Technical Training Program,\u201d subsidizing **US$ 150\u202fmillion** in training vouchers.  \n   - As a result, the proportion of workers with a **post\u2011secondary technical certificate** rose from **12\u202f% to 22\u202f%**, directly boosting their earning power.\n\n4. **Improved labor standards**  \n   - The agreement\u2019s labor side\u2011letter mandated **regular inspections** and the right to collective bargaining. Enforcement agencies doubled their inspection staff, cutting workplace violations by **\u2248\u202f40\u202f%** within five years.  \n   - Union density grew, giving workers a stronger voice in negotiating wages and safety standards.\n\n5. **Lower consumer prices \u2192 higher real purchasing power**  \n   - Duty\u2011free imports of machinery, electronics, and consumer goods reduced the cost of living. Households saved an average of **US$ 1\u202f200 per year** on imported goods, freeing income for savings, education, and health expenditures.\n\n6. **FD",
