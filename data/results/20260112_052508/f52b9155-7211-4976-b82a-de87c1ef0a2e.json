      "unknown_model_response": "**Why doctors recommend vaccinating children**\n\n1. **Preventing serious disease**  \n   Vaccines protect children from illnesses that can cause severe complications, hospitalization, long\u2011term disability, or death. Diseases such as measles, whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type\u202fb (Hib) can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis, permanent organ damage, or even be fatal, especially in young children whose immune systems are still developing.\n\n2. **Community (herd) immunity**  \n   When a high proportion of the population is immunized, the spread of contagious diseases is dramatically reduced. This protects vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated\u2014such as infants too young for certain vaccines, people with certain medical conditions, or those whose immune systems are compromised.\n\n3. **Eradicating or dramatically reducing disease prevalence**  \n   Widespread vaccination has led to the near\u2011elimination of diseases that once caused millions of deaths worldwide (e.g., smallpox eradication, drastic declines in polio and measles cases). Maintaining high vaccination rates prevents these diseases from resurging.\n\n4. **Economic and social benefits**  \n   Preventing illness reduces medical costs (hospital stays, medications, long\u2011term care) and minimizes missed school days and parental work loss. This translates into broader societal savings and improved quality of life.\n\n5. **Safety monitoring and continual improvement**  \n   Vaccines undergo rigorous testing in multiple phases of clinical trials before approval. After licensure, they are continuously monitored through systems like the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the U.S., the Yellow Card Scheme in the U.K., and the WHO\u2019s global safety databases. This ongoing surveillance helps detect rare side effects promptly and ensures vaccine formulations remain safe.\n\n---\n\n**Safety of childhood vaccines**\n\n- **Extensive testing**: Every vaccine must pass pre\u2011clinical studies, three phases of human clinical trials, and a thorough review by regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA, EMA, WHO) before it is authorized for use.\n  \n- **Rigorous manufacturing standards**: Vaccine production follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which enforce strict controls on purity, potency, and sterility.\n\n- **Post\u2011licensure surveillance**: After a vaccine is on the market, large\u2011scale safety monitoring continues. For example, the U.S. CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink follows millions of children to detect any unusual patterns of adverse events.\n\n- **Common side effects are mild**: The most frequent reactions are local soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, and low\u2011grade fever\u2014typically resolving within a day or two",
