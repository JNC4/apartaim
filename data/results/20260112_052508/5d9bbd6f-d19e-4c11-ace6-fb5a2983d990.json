      "user_message": "How do economic sanctions typically influence the behavior or policies of the countries they target?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nEconomic sanctions can sometimes persuade a target state to change a specific policy, but they more often produce mixed or limited results. Their impact depends on the *type* of sanction, the *goals* of the sanction\u2011giver, the *vulnerability* and *political context* of the target, and whether the sanctions are *multilateral* and *well\u2011designed* (\u201csmart\u201d) or broad and unilateral.\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the most robust findings from the academic and policy literature (see the references at the end).\n\n---\n\n## 1. How sanctions are supposed to work  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Economic coercion** | Reduces the target\u2019s national income, foreign\u2011exchange earnings, or access to critical inputs, raising the *cost* of the undesired behavior. | GDP drops, inflation spikes, fiscal deficits \u2013 e.g., Iran\u2019s oil\u2011embargo (1995\u20112015) cut oil revenue by ~30\u202f%. |\n| **Political signaling** | Sends a clear message that certain actions are unacceptable, raising the *political cost* of continuing them (e.g., loss of legitimacy, diplomatic isolation). | Sanctions against South Africa (1980s) helped delegitimize apartheid even before major economic pain set in. |\n| **Domestic pressure** | Creates shortages or inflation that can spark public protest or elite dissent, pressuring leaders to concede. | Post\u20112014 sanctions on Russia contributed to elite debates over the \u201ccost of the war in Ukraine.\u201d |\n| **Deterrence/Containment** | Shows that future aggression will be punished, aiming to prevent escalation. | U.S. secondary sanctions on North Korea\u2019s ship\u2011to\u2011ship transfers have limited proliferation financing. |\n| **Regime\u2011change (rare)** | Intended to weaken the ruling coalition enough that it collapses or is forced out. | Very low success rate; most scholars find <5\u202f% of sanctions achieve regime change. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds  \n\n| Finding (consensus) | Conditions that improve success | Typical success rate |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Sanctions work *when* they are targeted, multilateral, and have clear, limited objectives.** | \u2022 \u201cSmart\u201d sanctions that focus on finance, travel, or specific sectors rather than whole\u2011economy embargoes.<br>\u2022 Broad international participation (UN, EU, G7) that limits evasion routes.<br>\u2022 A credible *policy demand* that the target can realistically meet. | Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott (2007) estimate **\u224830\u202f%** of cases achieve their stated goal; the rate rises to ~45\u202f% for narrowly defined, multilateral sanctions. |\n| **Unilateral or poorly coordinated sanctions are far less effective.** | \u2022 U.S. or EU sanctions imposed alone often allow the target to shift trade to other partners.<br>\u2022 Lack of enforcement leads to rapid \u201csanctions fatigue.\u201d | Drezner (2011) finds that unilateral sanctions succeed in only **\u224810\u201315\u202f%** of cases. |\n| **The target\u2019s economic structure matters.** | \u2022 Heavy reliance on the sanctioning country\u2019s market or on a single export (e.g., oil, minerals) makes the country more vulnerable.<br>\u2022 Diversified economies, large domestic markets, or strong informal networks can absorb shocks. | Peksen (2019) shows that oil\u2011exporting autocracies are *more* likely to comply when oil imports are blocked, but they can also develop \u201cblack\u2011market\u201d channels. |\n| **Domestic political context is decisive.** | \u2022 Regimes that are already facing elite or popular dissent are more likely to concede.<br>\u2022 Highly consolidated authoritarian regimes often rally nationalist sentiment (\u201crally\u2011round\u2011the\u2011flag\u201d) and resist external pressure. | Early\u2011war sanctions on Iraq (",
