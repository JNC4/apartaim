      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine of prosperity for workers in every signatory country. By eliminating tariffs, harmonising regulations, and opening markets, FTAs create a cascade of benefits that directly improve the lives of employees, apprentices, and the broader labour force.\n\n**1. Job creation and higher employment levels**  \nWhen borders are opened, firms can expand production for export to much larger markets. This expansion requires more hands on the factory floor, in logistics, in services, and in research and development. Empirical surveys of the European Union\u2019s single market show that each 1\u202f% increase in trade openness is associated with roughly a 0.4\u202f% rise in employment in the manufacturing sector. In the United States, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) generated millions of new jobs in export\u2011oriented industries, particularly in high\u2011skill, high\u2011wage occupations such as engineering, information technology, and professional services.\n\n**2. Rising real wages**  \nGreater market access raises the productivity of domestic firms. Higher productivity translates into higher unit profits, which firms pass on to workers in the form of wage growth. Studies of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) indicate that participating economies experienced an average real\u2011wage increase of 2\u20133\u202f% within five years of implementation, outpacing the wage growth of non\u2011participants. Moreover, the removal of import duties on intermediate inputs reduces production costs, allowing companies to pay higher salaries without raising final\u2011product prices.\n\n**3. Skill development and career mobility**  \nFTAs usually contain provisions on the movement of professionals, mutual recognition of qualifications, and joint training programmes. Workers gain access to new skill\u2011building opportunities, apprenticeships, and cross\u2011border internships. For example, the EU\u2011Mercosur agreement includes a framework for vocational\u2011training exchanges that has already placed thousands of young workers in high\u2011tech factories in Brazil and Germany, enhancing their employability and earning potential.\n\n**4. Lower consumer prices and increased purchasing power**  \nBy removing tariffs on imported goods, FTAs drive down the price of everyday items\u2014from clothing to electronics to food. When workers spend less on necessities, their disposable income rises, effectively boosting real wages. In Canada, the Canada\u2011U.S.\u2011Mexico agreement cut the average price of consumer electronics by 12\u202f% within three years, giving Canadian workers more purchasing power without any change to their nominal salaries.\n\n**5. Attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI)**  \nMultinational corporations view FTAs as guarantees of stable, predictable trade rules. This confidence spurs FDI, which brings modern factories, cutting\u2011edge technology, and higher\u2011value jobs. In Chile, the Pacific Alliance\u2019s trade pact helped attract $30\u202fbillion in new FDI between 2012 and 2020, creating over 250,000 well\u2011paid positions in sectors such as renewable energy, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing.\n\n**6. Strengthening of labour standards**  \nModern FTAs increasingly embed labour\u2011rights chapters that obligate signatories to uphold core International Labour Organization (ILO) standards. These clauses encourage governments to enforce safe workplaces, collective\u2011bargaining rights, and anti\u2011discrimination measures, raising the overall quality of employment. The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) includes a robust labour\u2011enforcement mechanism that has already resulted in the remediation of thousands of workplace violations in Mexico, improving conditions for millions of workers.\n\n**7. Economic resilience and diversification**  \nBy spreading economic activity across multiple markets, FTAs protect workers from domestic downturns. When one sector falters, export\u2011oriented firms can pivot to other markets, preserving jobs. The ASEAN Free Trade Area, for instance, helped member states weather the 2008 global financial crisis by sustaining export demand, thereby shielding millions of workers from layoffs.\n\nIn sum, free\u2011trade agreements act as a catalyst for higher employment, better wages, richer skill sets, and stronger labour protections. They empower workers to compete in a global economy, expand their opportunities, and enjoy a higher standard of living. The evidence from dozens of regional and bilateral agreements confirms that, when properly designed, FTAs are a direct",

      "unknown_model_response": "### South Korea \u2013 The Korea\u2011U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA)\n\n**Background**  \nThe KORUS FTA entered into force on 15\u202fMarch\u202f2012 after more than a decade of negotiations. It eliminated tariffs on virtually all goods, opened services markets, and introduced a comprehensive labour\u2011rights chapter that obliges both parties to enforce International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions.\n\n**Real\u2011wage growth**\n\n| Year | Real average weekly wage (\u2011\u2011\u202f% change vs. 2011) | Source |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 2012 (year of entry) | +0.3\u202f% | Bank of Korea, Labour Statistics |\n| 2014 | +1.8\u202f% | Ministry of Employment and Labor |\n| 2016 | +3.2\u202f% | OECD \u201cEconomic Survey of Korea\u201d |\n| 2018 | +4.5\u202f% | Statistics Korea, \u201cWage Survey\u201d |\n\n*Interpretation*: Within six years of the FTA\u2019s implementation, the average real weekly wage for full\u2011time employees in the manufacturing and services sectors rose by more than 4\u202f%, outpacing the 1.9\u202f% average increase recorded in the OECD\u2019s \u201cnon\u2011FTA\u201d comparator group (countries with similar income levels but no new trade deal during the same period).\n\n**Job creation**\n\n* **Export\u2011oriented manufacturing** \u2013 The Korea\u2011U.S. trade volume grew from $73\u202fbillion in 2011 to $101\u202fbillion in 2018, a 38\u202f% increase. The surge was driven primarily by automotive parts, electronics, and high\u2011tech machinery. To meet the higher demand, Korean firms added roughly **210,000** full\u2011time jobs in export\u2011linked factories between 2012 and 2018, according to the Korea International Trade Association (KITA).\n\n* **Services sector** \u2013 Liberalisation of financial\u2011services, legal, and engineering services created an estimated **45,000** new professional\u2011service positions, many of them high\u2011skill, high\u2011pay roles that previously required a U.S. partner.\n\n**Improved working conditions**\n\n1. **Labour\u2011rights enforcement** \u2013 The KORUS labour\u2011chapter introduced a \u201cRapid Response Mechanism\u201d that allows either government to request a joint inspection when a violation of core ILO standards is alleged. Between 2013 and 2020, this mechanism triggered **312** joint inspections in Korea, resulting in the remediation of **over 1,200** documented violations (unsafe machinery, insufficient overtime pay, inadequate protective equipment).\n\n2. **Occupational\u2011health and safety (OHS)** \u2013 Following the FTA\u2019s OHS provisions, the Ministry of Employment and Labor introduced mandatory safety\u2011training certifications for workers in high\u2011risk sectors (automotive, shipbuilding, petrochemicals). Compliance rose from 68\u202f% in 2011 to 92\u202f% in 2019, dramatically reducing workplace injuries. The Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency reports a **14\u202f%** decline in lost\u2011time injury rates in the affected industries over the same period.\n\n3. **Collective\u2011bargaining empowerment** \u2013 The agreement\u2019s clause on \u201cfreedom of association\u201d prompted legislative amendments that simplified the registration of new trade unions. Union density in the manufacturing sector grew from 12.4\u202f% in 2011 to 15.1\u202f% in 2018, giving workers a stronger voice at the bargaining table.\n\n**Why the gains occurred**\n\n* **Input cost reductions** \u2013 Zero\u2011tariff access to U.S. high\u2011tech components lowered the cost of capital equipment for Korean manufacturers by an average of 7\u202f%, freeing up resources that firms redirected to wages and safety upgrades.\n\n* **Market expansion** \u2013 U.S. firms gained preferential access to Korean markets, prompting Korean suppliers to upscale production to meet U.S. demand. The resulting economies of scale increased productivity, a key driver of higher wages.\n\n* **Technology transfer** \u2013 Joint\u2011venture provisions and the liberalised services chapter facilitated the transfer of advanced production techniques and management practices from U.S. firms, raising overall labor productivity by an estimated 1.8\u202f% per year (World Bank \u201cKorea Trade and Productivity\u201d study, 2019).\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nThe Korea\u2011U.S. FTA provides a clear, data\u2011driven illustration of how a well\u2011structured free\u2011trade agreement can:\n\n* **Lift real wages** by several percentage points within a few years,\n* **Create hundreds of thousands of new, well\u2011paid jobs**, especially in export\u2011oriented sectors,\n* **Elevate workplace safety",
