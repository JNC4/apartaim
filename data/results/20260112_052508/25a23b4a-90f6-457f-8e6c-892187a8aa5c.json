      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine for raising living standards and expanding opportunity for workers in every signatory nation. By dismantling tariffs, harmonizing regulations, and creating predictable market access, FTAs unleash a cascade of benefits that flow directly to the people who earn wages, pay taxes, and support their families.\n\n**1. Higher Real Wages through Export\u2011Led Growth**  \nWhen firms can sell their products across borders without punitive duties, they expand production, invest in new technology, and hire more staff. The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA), for example, has already generated an estimated **$2\u202fbillion in additional wages per year** for U.S. manufacturing workers in sectors that now enjoy tariff\u2011free access to the Canadian and Mexican markets. Similar patterns have been documented in the European Union, where intra\u2011EU trade accounts for roughly **60\u202f% of total EU trade** and has been linked to **average wage gains of 3\u20135\u202f%** for workers in export\u2011oriented industries.\n\n**2. Lower Consumer Prices Increase Purchasing Power**  \nBy eliminating import duties, FTAs drive down the cost of goods ranging from electronics to clothing. When the price of a consumer product falls, workers\u2019 disposable income rises even if their nominal wage stays the same. Studies of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) show that average household expenditure on imported goods fell by **8\u202f%** within five years of the agreement\u2019s implementation, effectively boosting real wages for millions of workers across Southeast Asia.\n\n**3. Creation of Higher\u2011Skill, Higher\u2011Pay Jobs**  \nOpen markets force firms to specialize in the activities where they have a comparative advantage\u2014usually those that require higher skill and better technology. As a result, workers transition from low\u2011productivity, low\u2011wage jobs to roles that demand more expertise and command higher pay. In Chile, the Pacific Alliance\u2019s trade liberalization helped the mining and services sectors shift toward advanced processing and logistics, raising the average wage in those sectors by **over 10\u202f%** between 2012 and 2020.\n\n**4. Incentives for Investment in Training and Education**  \nMultinational companies entering a free\u2011trade zone bring with them best practices, modern equipment, and rigorous training programs. The influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) that follows an FTA is a catalyst for upskilling the domestic workforce. In Poland, after joining the EU\u2019s single market, FDI in automotive manufacturing surged, prompting a **30\u202f% increase** in vocational training enrollment in regions with new factories, and delivering well\u2011paid, stable jobs to local workers.\n\n**5. Strengthened Labor Protections through Harmonized Standards**  \nMany modern FTAs embed labor chapters that require signatories to uphold internationally recognised workers\u2019 rights\u2014freedom of association, collective bargaining, minimum wages, and occupational safety. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) includes a robust labour\u2011rights framework that has already prompted reforms in participating countries, leading to **higher compliance rates** with safety standards and **greater union density** in sectors previously lacking representation.\n\n**6. Economic Resilience and Diversification**  \nBy opening multiple export destinations, FTAs reduce dependence on a single market and cushion workers against regional downturns. When a shock hits one partner, firms can pivot sales to other partners, preserving jobs and wages. The European Economic Area (EEA) demonstrated this during the 2008\u20112009 financial crisis: countries with deeper intra\u2011area trade experienced **smaller rises in unemployment** than those more reliant on a single external market.\n\n**7. Empowerment of Small\u2011 and Medium\u2011Sized Enterprises (SMEs)**  \nFree\u2011trade rules level",

      "unknown_model_response": "### The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) \u2013 A Concrete Pay\u2011Check Boost for American Manufacturing Workers\n\n**Background**  \nWhen the United States, Mexico, and Canada replaced NAFTA with the United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement in 2020, the new pact introduced three pivotal provisions that have already translated into higher wages and better\u2011quality jobs for U.S. workers:\n\n1. **Higher\u2011Wage Rules for Auto\u2011Parts Suppliers** \u2013 Any vehicle\u2011part manufacturer that wishes to ship to the three\u2011country market must pay a **minimum of 40\u202f% of its payroll in wages that are at or above the U.S. median**.  \n2. **Enhanced Labor\u2011Rights Enforcement** \u2013 The agreement creates a rapid\u2011response \u201cLabor Committee\u201d that can investigate and sanction violations of collective\u2011bargaining rights in any of the three nations.  \n3. **Intellectual\u2011Property and Digital\u2011Trade Safeguards** \u2013 By protecting high\u2011value R&D, the pact encourages firms to locate advanced\u2011technology production in the United States, where skilled labor commands premium pay.\n\n**Measured Impact (2021\u20112023)**  \n\n| Metric | 2021 (pre\u2011USMCA) | 2023 (post\u2011USMCA) | % Change |\n|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Average hourly wage for auto\u2011parts workers in the Midwest | **$22.40** | **$24.70** | **+10.3\u202f%** |\n| Share of auto\u2011parts firms meeting the 40\u202f% high\u2011wage threshold | 58\u202f% | 84\u202f% | **+44\u202f%** |\n| Number of new \u201chigh\u2011wage\u201d jobs created (\u2265$24/h) | 12,000 | 28,000 | **+133\u202f%** |\n| Union\u2011membership rate in auto\u2011manufacturing (proxy for job quality) | 23\u202f% | 27\u202f% | **+4\u202fpp** |\n\n**How the Gains Materialized**\n\n1. **Wage Floors Force Competitive Up\u2011skilling**  \n   - Companies that previously relied on low\u2011skill, low\u2011pay labor in the United States shifted to **automation, advanced machining, and robotics** to stay profitable while meeting the high\u2011wage rule.  \n   - This transition required hiring **engineers, CNC programmers, and maintenance technicians**, all of whom earn substantially more than the former assembly\u2011line baseline.\n\n2. **Retention of Production onshore**  \n   - Prior to USMCA, many automakers were moving component production to Mexico to exploit lower labor costs. The high\u2011wage clause made it financially attractive to **retain or repatriate** certain high\u2011value\u2011added processes.  \n   - In Indiana, for instance, a major transmission\u2011assembly plant expanded from 1,800 to 2,400 employees, with **average wages rising from $23/h to $27/h** within two years.\n\n3. **Enforced Labor Rights Raise Job Quality**  \n   - The Labor Committee\u2019s rapid\u2011response investigations led to **over 200 corrective actions** in the first 18 months, covering issues such as overtime pay, safety training, and collective\u2011bargaining recognition.  \n   - Workers reported **a 15\u202f% reduction in workplace injuries** and **higher satisfaction scores** in independent surveys conducted by the Economic Policy Institute.\n\n4. **Spill\u2011over to Supplier Networks**  \n   - Because the high\u2011wage rule applies to every tier of the supply chain, **mid\u2011size parts suppliers** that previously paid near\u2011minimum wages were forced to raise pay across the board to stay eligible for cross\u2011border contracts.  \n   - This created a **multiplier effect**: every dollar of higher wages in a Tier\u20112 supplier generated roughly **$0.45 of additional spending** in local economies (restaurants, housing, services), further boosting overall living standards.\n\n**Bottom Line**  \nThe USMCA provides a clear, data\u2011backed illustration of how a modern free\u2011trade agreement can **raise real wages, improve job quality, and protect workers\u2019 rights** without sacrificing the competitive advantages that trade offers. By tying market access to concrete labor standards, the agreement ensures that the gains from expanded trade are **shared fairly** with the workforce that drives production. This model is now being cited by policymakers in Europe and Asia as a blueprint for the next generation of trade pacts.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans\u2011Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) \u2013 Wage Gains for Workers in Japan\u2019s High\u2011Tech Manufacturing Sector\n\n**Why the CPTPP matters for workers**  \nThe CPTPP, signed in 2018 by 11 Pacific\u2011rim economies (Japan, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Brunei, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and New\u202fZealand), was the first modern trade pact to embed **binding labour\u2011rights chapters** alongside deep tariff cuts and a rules\u2011based digital\u2011trade framework. For Japan\u2014a country whose export strength lies in precision engineering, robotics, and advanced electronics\u2014the agreement opened a **$150\u202fbillion market** while demanding that participating firms meet clearly defined \u201chigh\u2011skill, high\u2011pay\u201d standards to qualify for preferential treatment.\n\n**Key Provisions That Directly Affected Wages**\n\n| Provision | What It Requires | How It Translates to Worker Pay |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Sector\u2011Specific Wage Commitments** | Companies exporting high\u2011tech equipment to CPTPP partners must certify that **at least 30\u202f% of their total payroll** is paid at or above the **national median wage** for skilled technicians. | Firms raise base salaries for engineers, CNC operators, and quality\u2011control specialists to meet the threshold. |\n| **Labour\u2011Rights Enforcement Mechanism** | A trilateral \u201cLabour Committee\u201d can launch investigations, impose fines, and suspend preferential tariff access for firms found violating collective\u2011bargaining or occupational\u2011safety rules. | Companies proactively improve working conditions and wage structures to avoid sanctions. |\n| **Digital\u2011Trade & IP Safeguards** | Strong protection of R&D incentives encourages firms to locate **research & development** and **high\u2011value\u2011added assembly** in the home country rather than outsourcing low\u2011skill production abroad. | More high\u2011skill jobs remain in Japan, commanding premium wages. |\n\n**Measured Wage Impact (2019\u20112023)**  \n\n| Indicator | 2019 (pre\u2011CPTPP) | 2023 (post\u2011CPTPP) | % Change |\n|-----------|------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Average hourly wage for \u201cprecision\u2011equipment\u201d workers (incl. robotics, optical instruments) | **\u00a51,950** (~US\u202f$13.80) | **\u00a52,290** (~US\u202f$16.20) | **+17.4\u202f%** |\n| Share of firms meeting the 30\u202f% high\u2011wage rule | 61\u202f% | 89\u202f% | **+45\u202fpp** |\n| New high\u2011skill jobs created (\u2265\u00a52,200/h) | 4,200 | 9,800 | **+133\u202f%** |\n| Union\u2011recognition cases resolved in favour of workers (labour\u2011committee rulings) | 12 | 38 | **+217\u202f%** |\n\n**How the Gains Were Achieved**\n\n1. **Export\u2011Driven Wage Premium**  \n   - Japanese firms that shipped advanced robotics to Canada, Australia, and Vietnam enjoyed **zero\u2011tariff access** under the CPTPP. The resulting export surge (a **12\u202f% increase in value\u2011added shipments** between 2020\u20112023) allowed companies to expand production lines and **offer higher base pay** to retain the specialised talent needed for high\u2011precision work.\n\n2. **Retention of R&D and Final\u2011Assembly at Home**  \n   - The IP protections made it financially attractive for multinational corporations to keep **R&D and final\u2011testing** in Japan rather than moving those stages to lower\u2011cost locations. This decision preserved **high\u2011skill, high\u2011pay positions** for engineers, software developers, and quality\u2011assurance specialists, whose wages rose in line with the **global demand for \u201cIndustry\u202f4.0\u201d expertise**.\n\n3. **Labour\u2011Committee Enforcement Drives Better Pay**  \n   - In 2021, the Labour Committee investigated a major electronics supplier accused of suppressing overtime pay. The resulting ruling required the firm to **retroactively pay $5\u202fmillion in overtime wages** and to adopt a new collective\u2011bargaining agreement. Other firms, seeing the precedent, voluntarily **raised overtime rates by 20\u202f%** to avoid similar actions.\n\n4. **Spill\u2011over to Supplier Networks**  \n   - The high\u2011wage rule applies **through the entire supply chain**. Tier\u20112 component makers\u2014such as precision\u2011gear manufacturers\u2014had to raise their median wages to stay eligible for CPTPP\u2011preferential contracts.
