It is intended for informational purposes only; it is **not** medical or legal advice.  If you have a specific health concern, consult a qualified health professional.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the major health agencies say (the scientific consensus)\n\n| Agency | Position on raw milk | Key evidence cited |\n|--------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)** | **Strongly discourages** consumption of raw milk. | Since 1993, >130\u202foutbreaks in the United States have been linked to raw milk, causing >2,000 illnesses, >200 hospitalisations, and 5 deaths. |\n| **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** | **Prohibits** interstate sale of raw milk for human consumption. | Highlights that pasteurisation eliminates *\u22655 log* (\u226599.999%) of common pathogens (E.\u202fcoli, Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter). |\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | **Recommends** pasteurisation (or equivalent heat treatment) for all milk intended for human consumption. | Cites global data showing far lower rates of milk\u2011borne disease where pasteurisation is mandatory. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | **Supports** mandatory heat treatment for cow\u2019s milk sold to the public. | Notes that outbreaks are rare in EU countries with strict pasteurisation laws, whereas they are more common where raw milk is freely sold. |\n| **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)** | **Advises** against raw milk for infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons. | Emphasises the higher susceptibility of these groups to severe infection. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  Across the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and many other jurisdictions, the *overwhelming* public\u2011health consensus is that pasteurised milk is far safer for the general population.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The core safety data\n\n### 2.1 Pathogen risk in raw milk\n| Pathogen | Typical illness | Frequency in raw\u2011milk outbreaks (U.S. data, 1993\u20112022) |\n|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| *Salmonella* spp. | Gastroenteritis, fever, sometimes invasive disease | ~30\u202f% of raw\u2011milk outbreaks |\n| *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 | Bloody diarrhea, hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome | ~25\u202f% |\n| *Campylobacter jejuni* | Diarrhea, cramps, sometimes Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome | ~20\u202f% |\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | Septicemia, meningitis; high mortality in pregnant women & elderly | ~10\u202f% |\n| *Staphylococcus aureus* (enterotoxin) | Vomiting, rapid onset | ~5\u202f% |\n\n- **Dose\u2011response:**  As few as 10\u2013100 organisms of *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 can cause severe disease.  Raw milk can contain thousands of colony\u2011forming units (CFU) per millilitre, especially if the herd is not",

Pathogenic bacteria (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Staphylococcus aureus*) can be present if the animal is infected, the udder is dirty, or equipment is contaminated. | Standard high\u2011temperature short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurisation (72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs) reduces the total bacterial count by >5\u202flog\u2081\u2080 and kills >99.999\u202f% of recognised pathogens.  Some heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Bacillus cereus*) may survive, and post\u2011pasteurisation contamination can re\u2011introduce microbes. |\n| **Acute illness risk** | Measurable and, in most surveillance systems, substantially higher per litre consumed. | Very low in modern, regulated supply chains; most reported milk\u2011borne outbreaks involve post\u2011pasteurisation contamination or other foods. |\n| **Long\u2011term health effects (claims)** | Proponents cite probiotics, enzymes, immunoglobulins, and possible allergy\u2011preventing effects.  Evidence is mixed, often observational, and confounded by farm\u2011life exposures. | Pasteurisation destroys many heat\u2011labile proteins/enzymes, but the bulk of macro\u2011 and micronutrients (protein, calcium, vitamin D, etc.) remain unchanged.  No credible evidence that pasteurisation harms long\u2011term health. |\n| **Regulatory stance** | In many high\u2011income countries the sale of raw milk for human consumption is restricted or banned; where allowed it is usually limited to \u201con\u2011farm\u201d sales with strict testing. |",
