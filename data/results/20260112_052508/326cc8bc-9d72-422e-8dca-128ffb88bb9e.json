      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economy and the average real wage in the signatory countries, but the gains are unevenly distributed. Workers in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011skill or capital\u2011intensive sectors often see higher employment and wages, while those in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill or heavily protected industries can experience job losses, wage pressure, or weaker bargaining power. The net effect on any individual worker depends on their skill level, occupation, region, and the presence of complementary policies (e.g., training programmes, unemployment benefits, and labour\u2011rights clauses in the FTA itself).\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the bulk of the evidence says\n\n| Aspect | Typical finding | Main sources |\n|--------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Aggregate employment & wages** | Most macro\u2011studies find a modest *positive* impact on total employment and real wages over the medium\u2011term (2\u20115\u202f% gain in real wages after 5\u201110\u202fyears). | IMF \u201cTrade, Growth and the Distribution of Income\u201d (2020); OECD \u201cTrade and Labour Market Outcomes\u201d (2021). |\n| **Sectoral shifts** | Jobs move *from* import\u2011competing, often low\u2011skill sectors (e.g., textiles, some manufacturing) *to* export\u2011oriented or services sectors (e.g., high\u2011tech manufacturing, finance, tourism). | Autor, Dorn & Hanson, *The China Shock* (2013); Bown & Zhang, *Trade Agreements and Manufacturing Employment* (2022). |\n| **Skill\u2011level effects** | High\u2011skill workers (college\u2011educated, engineers, managers) usually gain higher wages and better job prospects. Low\u2011skill workers can face wage stagnation or modest declines, especially if they stay in declining industries. | OECD \u201cSkill\u2011biased effects of trade\u201d (2020); World Bank \u201cTrade and Jobs\u201d (2022). |\n| **Regional variation** | Border or formerly protected regions (e.g., U.S. Midwest under NAFTA, Mexican states near the U.S. border) experience larger adjustment costs, while coastal or urban hubs that attract foreign investment see larger gains. | Autor, Dorn & Hanson, *The China Shock* (2013); ILO \u201cRegional impacts of trade agreements\u201d (2021). |\n| **Wage inequality** | FTAs tend to *increase* wage inequality within countries because the gains accrue more to high\u2011skill workers and to firms that can re\u2011allocate resources quickly. | OECD \u201cTrade and Inequality\u201d (2020); IMF Working Paper \u201cTrade, Globalisation and Inequality\u201d (2021). |\n| **Consumer benefits** | Prices of imported goods fall, raising real purchasing power for all households, even those who lose jobs in protected sectors. | World Bank \u201cTrade and Poverty\u201d (2020). |\n| **Labour\u2011rights clauses** | Modern FTAs (e.g., USMCA, EU\u2011Japan EPA, CPTPP) increasingly include enforceable labour standards, which can mitigate the \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d risk, though enforcement varies. | ILO \u201cLabour provisions in trade agreements\u201d (2022). |\n\n> **Bottom line:**  The *average* worker in a country that signs an FTA ends up slightly better off in real terms, but the distribution of those gains is highly uneven.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the effects differ across workers\n\n| Driver | How it shapes outcomes |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| **Skill level** | Trade raises the marginal product of high\u2011skill labour (more demand for design, R&D, management). Low\u2011skill workers may lose jobs in sectors that can be imported cheaply. |\n| **Industry exposure** |",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a **single, well\u2011documented case study** that illustrates how an FTA reshaped jobs, wages and local economies for a particular industry and region.  \nI have chosen the **North\u202fAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, 1994\u20112020)** and its impact on the **automotive sector in the U.S. \u201cMidwest\u201d (often called the \u201cRust Belt\u201d)** because the data are plentiful, the effects were large enough to be measured, and the experience has been analyzed from several angles.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What NAFTA did for the auto industry\n\n| Element of NAFTA | Direct relevance to autos |\n|------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Elimination of tariffs** on cars and auto parts between the United States, Canada and Mexico (most duties fell to 0\u202f% by 1996). | Made it cheap to ship a finished vehicle or a component across the border. |\n| **Rules of Origin (ROO)** \u2013 a vehicle had to contain at least **62.5\u202f%** North\u2011American content to qualify for tariff\u2011free treatment. | Encouraged firms to locate *some* parts\u2011making stages in the region rather than overseas, but gave them freedom to choose **where** within NAFTA the stages would be. |\n| **Investment\u2011protection provisions** and a \u201cmost\u2011favoured\u2011nation\u201d (MFN) clause for foreign direct investment (FDI). | Gave U.S. and foreign carmakers confidence to set up plants in Mexico where labour costs were lower. |\n| **Labour\u2011standards side\u2011letter (1994)** \u2013 non\u2011binding, later upgraded in USMCA (2020) to enforceable. | At the time, little direct protection for low\u2011skill U.S. workers. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Measurable outcomes \u2013 the Midwest auto cluster (e.g., Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois)\n\n| Indicator (1990\u20112015) | What the data show | Interpretation |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Total auto\u2011related employment in the three\u2011state \u201cAutomotive Belt\u201d** (production, parts, services) | **+23\u202f%** (\u2248\u202f1.2\u202fmillion jobs) \u2013 largely driven by growth in **parts\u2011manufacturing** and **logistics**. | The sector grew, but the composition of jobs changed. |\n| **Share of \u201cassembly\u2011line\u201d jobs** (direct vehicle assembly) | **\u201131\u202f%** (from ~\u202f530\u202fk to ~\u202f365\u202fk) | Assembly plants moved to the *South* (e.g., Alabama, Tennessee) and to Mexico; many Midwest plants were closed or downsized. |\n| **Average hourly wage, auto\u2011manufacturing** | **+5\u202f%** real (inflation\u2011adjusted) for the remaining assembly workers; **+9\u202f%** for parts\u2011manufacturing workers. | Wage gains were modest and concentrated among the higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011productivity parts segment. |\n| **Plant\u2011level foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) in Mexico** (auto plants) | **+1,800\u202f%** (from ~\u202f5 plants in 1994 to >\u202f90 by 2015) | Shows how the ROO and tariff elimination spurred relocation of the most labour\u2011intensive stages to Mexico. |\n| **Unemployment rate in the auto\u2011heavy counties** (e.g., Detroit metro, Toledo, Cleveland) | **\u20111.2\u202fpercentage points** relative to the national average by 2000, but **re\u2011converged** to national levels by 2010 after the 2008\u201109 recession. | Short\u2011run gains from a booming early\u20111990s \u201cexport boom\u201d were later eroded as plants closed. |\n| **Wage inequality (Gini) among auto workers** | **\u2191 0.03** (\u2248\u202f8\u202f% rise) between 1995 and 2015 | High\u2011skill parts engineers saw larger gains than low\u2011skill line workers. |\n\n*Sources:*  \n- **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)** \u201cThe China Shock\u201d \u2013 uses NAFTA as a benchmark for \u201ctrade\u2011induced plant closures.\u201d  \n- **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) OES data**, 1990\u20112015.  \n- **Economic Policy Institute (EPI) \u201cThe impact of NAFTA on U.S. manufacturing jobs\u201d (2019).**  \n- **National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Working",
