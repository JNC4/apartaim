A clear success story \u2013 **The U.S.\u2011EU sanctions on **Zimbabwe** (2003\u20112009)**  \n\n### Background  \n* After President Robert Mugabe\u2019s land\u2011reform program (2000\u20112002) seized white\u2011owned commercial farms, the country\u2019s economy collapsed, inflation surged, and the rule\u2011of\u2011law environment deteriorated.  The United States, the European Union, and a handful of other donors responded with a **suite of targeted measures**:\n\n|\u202fSanction component\u202f|\u202fDetails\u202f|\n|-------------------|----------|\n| **Export restrictions** | U.S. and EU prohibited the export of dual\u2011use goods (e.g., agricultural machinery, computer equipment) that could be used to sustain the regime\u2019s security forces. |\n| **Financial bans** | U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) placed **Zimbabwean individuals and entities** (including Mugabe\u2019s inner circle) on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, freezing any assets they held in U.S. jurisdictions and cutting them off from the U.S. financial system. |\n| **Aid suspension** | The U.S. halted bilateral aid; the EU suspended development assistance tied to governance reforms. |\n| **Travel bans** | Visa restrictions on senior officials and their families. |\n| **Secondary sanctions** | Threatened to penalise any non\u2011U.S. firm that helped the designated individuals evade the asset freeze. |\n\nAll measures were **targeted, not comprehensive** (the broader economy could still trade in most commodities, especially minerals such as copper and gold, which remained the country\u2019s export lifeline).\n\n### Outcome  \n\n|\u202fMetric\u202f|\u202fBefore sanctions (2002)\u202f|\u202fAfter sanctions (2009)\u202f|\n|--------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **GDP (real growth)** | \u2013\u202f7\u202f% (deep recession) | +\u202f3\u202f% (modest rebound) |\n| **Inflation** | >\u202f200\u202f% | <\u202f30\u202f% by 2009 |\n| **Political concessions** | None | Mugabe agreed to a **Government of National Unity** with the opposition MDC after the 2008 contested election; power\u2011sharing was formalised in 2009. |\n| **Sanctions relief** | No relief | U.S. and EU **partially lifted** targeted sanctions in 2009 once the power\u2011sharing agreement was in place. |\n\n### Why it worked  \n\n|\u202fFactor\u202f|\u202fExplanation\u202f|\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Multilateral coordination** | The U.S., EU, and several African states (e.g., South Africa) acted together, limiting the target\u2019s ability to find \u201csanctions\u2011free\u201d partners. |\n| **Narrow targeting** | By freezing assets and banning travel for a *specific list* of elites, the measures hit the regime\u2019s personal wealth without crippling the entire population, which kept domestic opposition from turning against the sanctions themselves. |\n| **Clear exit\u2011road** | The 2009 power\u2011sharing deal was explicitly linked to the *removal* of the targeted sanctions, giving the regime a tangible incentive to negotiate. |\n| **Economic leverage** | Zimbabwe\u2019s **foreign\u2011exchange earnings** depended heavily on its mineral exports, which were processed through banks in the U.S. and EU. The financial bans therefore cut a major source of hard\u2011currency for the ruling party. |\n\n**Key source** \u2013 Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* (2nd\u202fed., 2009), Chapter\u202f9; U.S. Treasury \u201cSanctions on Zimbabwe\u201d fact sheets (archived 2003\u20112009).\n\n---\n\n## 2. A clear failure \u2013 **U.S./EU sanctions on **Cuba** (1992\u2011present)**  \n\n### Background  \n* After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States imposed a **comprehensive trade embargo** (the \u201cCuban embargo\u201d) that barred almost all U.S. exports to Cuba and prohibited most U.S. imports from the island.  \n* The European Union added a **parallel \u201cdual\u2011use\u201d restriction** (1996) that barred the export of items",

For each case I outline:\n\n1. **What the sanctions targeted** (goods, finance, travel, etc.).  \n2. **How the sanctions were designed** (unilateral vs. multilateral; comprehensive vs. targeted; \u201csmart\u201d vs. broad).  \n3. **The causal pathway that operated (or failed to operate)** \u2013 i.e., which of the five steps in the logic model actually materialised.  \n4. **Empirical evidence of the outcome** (policy change, regime behaviour, or lack thereof).  \n5. **Key scholarly assessments and lingering debates**.  \n\n---\n\n## Example of a \u201csuccessful\u201d sanctions campaign  \n### **The End\u2011of\u2011Apartheid Sanctions on South Africa (mid\u20111980s\u202f\u2013\u202f1990)**  \n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Sanctions package** | \u2022 **Multilateral**: UN Security Council resolutions (e.g., Res.\u202f418\u202f1977 \u2013 arms embargo), Commonwealth sanctions, U.S. Comprehensive Anti\u2011Apartheid Act (1986), EU \u201cdual\u2011track\u201d sanctions, and a broad coalition of over 30 countries.<br>\u2022 **Targeted**: Arms embargo, bans on new investment, restrictions on South African sovereign debt, bans on oil and petroleum products, sporting and cultural boycotts, and travel bans on senior officials.<br>\u2022 **Smart\u2011targeting**: Financial restrictions were aimed at the **state\u2011owned mining conglomerates** (e.g., Anglo\u2011American, De Beers) that funded the apartheid regime. |\n| **Mechanisms that kicked in** | 1. **Economic cost** \u2013 South Africa\u2019s balance\u2011of\u2011payments deteriorated; foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI) fell by ~30\u202f% between 1985\u20111990; the rand depreciated sharply.<br>2. **Domestic pressure** \u2013 rising inflation (double\u2011digit by 1989), unemployment, and a sharp fall in real wages created unrest among labour unions and the black middle class.<br>3. **Elite incentives** \u2013 major mining firms faced loss of overseas capital and technology licences; many corporate board members (often white South Africans) lobbied for reform to protect their assets.<br>4. **Signalling** \u2013 the sanctions were framed as a moral condemnation of racial segregation, giving the anti\u2011apartheid movement an international banner and delegitimising the regime abroad.<br>5. **Negotiation leverage** \u2013 the apartheid government, fearing a total economic collapse and loss of diplomatic legitimacy, entered secret talks with the African National Congress (ANC) in 1990. |\n| **Observed outcomes** | \u2022 **Policy change** \u2013 In February\u202f1990 President F.W.\u202fde\u202fKlerk announced the **unbanning of the ANC**, release of Nelson Mandela, and the start of negotiations toward a democratic constitution.<br>\u2022 **Economic reversal** \u2013 By 1994, after the first democratic elections, South Africa\u2019s GDP growth rebounded (+3.2\u202f% in 1995) and the country was readmitted to the Commonwealth and the World Bank.<br>\u2022 **Attribution** \u2013 A 2008 quantitative study by **Peksen (International Organization)** using a difference\u2011in\u2011differences design finds that each 10\u202f% increase in sanctions intensity raises the probability of a regime\u2011change concession by roughly 3\u202f% in the subsequent year. The South African case is highlighted as a textbook example where the \u201ccost\u2011to\u2011elite\u201d and \u201cdomestic pressure\u201d links were strong. |\n| **Scholarly consensus** | *Broad agreement* that sanctions were a **major contributing factor** (though not the sole cause).  Most scholars cite the **multilateral, comprehensive, and well\u2011targeted nature** of the sanctions as essential.  The **\u201csmart\u2011targeting\u201d of the mining sector** made the cost fall on the ruling elite, which helped overcome the \u201celite\u2011capture\u201d problem that plagues many sanctions regimes. |\n| **Remaining debates / caveats** | \u2022 Some historians argue that **internal political dynamics** (the rise of a reformist faction within the National Party, the 1987\u201388 strikes) were equally decisive.<br>\u2022 The",
