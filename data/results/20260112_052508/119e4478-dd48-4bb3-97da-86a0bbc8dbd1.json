      "unknown_model_response": "## Quick Take\u2011away  \n\n| What the evidence **generally** shows | What remains **uncertain / contested** |\n|---|---|\n| \u2022 **Aggregate welfare rises** \u2013 most studies find that a free\u2011trade agreement (FTA) raises the total size of the economies that sign it (higher GDP, lower consumer prices, more foreign\u2011direct investment).  | \u2022 **How large the net gain is for workers** \u2013 estimates range from a few\u2011percent increase in real wages to virtually zero, depending on the country, the sector, and the time horizon. |\n| \u2022 **Winners are unevenly distributed** \u2013 workers in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011skill, or capital\u2011intensive industries tend to see higher wages and more jobs; workers in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill, or heavily unionised sectors often face job loss or wage pressure. | \u2022 **Long\u2011run adjustment speed** \u2013 some countries rebound within a few years, others experience prolonged structural unemployment. The role of \u201cadjustment assistance\u201d programs is still debated. |\n| \u2022 **Consumer benefits are large** \u2013 cheaper imported goods raise real purchasing power for almost all households, even those who lose a job. | \u2022 **Impact on labor standards & rights** \u2013 FTAs sometimes include \u201clabour chapters,\u201d but enforcement varies; the causal link between FTAs and improvements (or deterioration) in workplace safety, union freedom, or child\u2011labour laws is not settled. |\n| \u2022 **Skill\u2011biased effects** \u2013 FTAs tend to raise the demand for skilled labour more than for low\u2011skill labour, widening wage gaps in many cases. | \u2022 **Effect on income inequality** \u2013 some studies attribute rising inequality to trade, others point to technology, tax policy, or the decline of unions. Isolating the trade component is methodologically hard. |\n| \u2022 **Capital\u2011intensive vs labour\u2011intensive gains** \u2013 capital\u2011rich countries (e.g., the United States, EU members) usually see larger gains for workers than labour\u2011rich developing countries, which may see modest wage growth but larger employment gains in export sectors. | \u2022 **\u201cRace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d hypothesis** \u2013 does trade force countries to lower wages or labour protections to stay competitive? Evidence is mixed; some regions see convergence, others see a \u201cfloor\u201d effect from global standards or multinational corporate policies. |\n\nBelow is a **comprehensive, evidence\u2011based overview** that walks through the main mechanisms, the strongest findings from the academic and policy literature, the points where scholars disagree, and why those disagreements matter for real\u2011world policy.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical Foundations \u2013 Why FTAs matter for workers  \n\n| Theory | Core prediction for workers | Typical empirical test |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Heckscher\u2011Ohlin / Stolper\u2011Samuelson** (1950s) | Trade raises the real wage of the *abundant* factor (usually labour in developing countries) and lowers the real wage of the *scarce* factor. | Compare wage growth in labour\u2011abundant vs capital\u2011abundant countries after an FTA. |\n| **Specific\u2011Factor (Ricardian) Model** | Workers tied to *export\u2011oriented* sectors benefit; workers in *import\u2011competing* sectors lose. | Sector\u2011level employment and wage changes. |\n| **Skill\u2011Bias / Technological Complementarity** (1990s\u20112000s) | Trade intensifies demand for skilled labour because exporting firms adopt more capital\u2011intensive technologies. | Wage differentials by education level before/after trade liberalisation. |\n| **New\u2011Trade Theory (Krugman, 1980s)**",
