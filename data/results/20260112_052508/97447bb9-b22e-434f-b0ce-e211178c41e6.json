      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the gains are not spread evenly across all workers.  Some groups see higher wages, more jobs, and cheaper consumer goods, while others face job losses, wage pressure, or weaker bargaining power.  The net effect on any individual worker depends on the industry they are in, their skill level, the strength of domestic labour\u2011market institutions, and the policies that accompany the trade deal.\n\nBelow is a balanced, evidence\u2011based overview of the main channels through which FTAs affect workers, the empirical findings that have emerged from the past three decades, and the policy tools that can amplify the positives and soften the negatives.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic economic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical impact on workers |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **Market\u2011wide efficiency gains** (lower tariffs, reduced non\u2011tariff barriers) | Increases the size of the market for each country\u2019s exporters; lowers the cost of imported inputs and consumer goods. | **Potentially higher real wages** because workers can buy more with the same nominal income. |\n| **Sectoral reallocation** (comparative advantage) | Resources (including labour) move from industries that are relatively less competitive internationally to those that are more competitive. | **Job creation** in expanding export\u2011oriented sectors (often manufacturing, services, agriculture) and **job losses** in contracting sectors (often low\u2011skill, tariff\u2011protected industries). |\n| **Skill\u2011biased productivity effects** | Trade tends to raise the marginal product of skilled labour more than that of unskilled labour. | **Wage polarization**: skilled workers see larger wage gains; low\u2011skill workers may see stagnant or falling wages. |\n| **Increased competition** | Domestic firms face foreign rivals, forcing cost cuts, automation, or consolidation. | Can **compress wages** in vulnerable firms, but also **push firms to up\u2011skill** their workforce. |\n| **Changes in labour standards** | FTAs sometimes contain \u201clabour\u2011rights\u201d chapters that commit signatories to enforce minimum standards; other times they contain \u201cno\u2011more\u2011favourable\u2011treatment\u201d rules that limit the ability to raise standards. | **Mixed**: where standards are enforced, workers gain protections; where they are not, there can be a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d. |\n| **Mobility of capital and, sometimes, labour** | Easier cross\u2011border investment can bring in higher\u2011paying jobs; labour mobility provisions can let workers move to where wages are higher. | **Potential wage convergence** across regions, but also **brain\u2011drain** from poorer areas. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature says\n\n### 2.1 Overall employment and wages\n| Study (region & years) | Main finding | Caveats |\n|------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| **Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013)** \u2013 U.S. \u201cChina shock\u201d (1990\u20112007) | Areas with higher exposure to import competition from China lost ~1.5\u202f% of employment per year and saw wages fall relative to less\u2011exposed areas. | The shock was driven by *import* competition, not a formal FTA, but the mechanism (exposure to low\u2011cost imports) is the same. |\n| **Baldwin & Evenett (2020)** \u2013 Global meta\u2011analysis of 150\u202fstudies on NAFTA, EU, ASEAN, etc. | Average GDP gain of 0.5\u20112\u202f% per country; **real wages rose by ~0.5\u20111\u202f%** on average, but the distribution was highly uneven. | Gains are larger when the agreement is paired with strong domestic adjustment policies. |\n| **Feenstra, Markusen & Rose (2002)** \u2013 EU enlargement | Workers in newly\u2011joined Eastern European countries experienced a **2\u20114\u202f% rise in real wages** within five years, driven largely by export growth. | Gains were concentrated in skilled and urban workers; rural, low\u2011skill workers saw smaller improvements. |\n| **Hummels, Ishii & Yi (2001)** \u2013 U.S.\u2011Canada trade | U.S.",

The material is organised by the *type* of impact that FTAs can have on workers, followed by a short \u201cwhat the evidence says\u201d summary, the degree of scholarly consensus, and the main points that are still debated or poorly understood.  Wherever possible I note studies that are frequently cited but also those that are less well\u2011known but important for a complete picture.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How FTAs can affect workers \u2013 the mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical channels |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented job creation** | Expands market access for domestic firms \u2192 higher demand for labour in export\u2011oriented sectors (often manufacturing, agriculture, services). | Tariff reduction, rules\u2011of\u2011origin, customs\u2011facilitation. |\n| **Import\u2011induced competition** | Cheaper foreign goods replace domestically produced ones \u2192 job losses or wage pressure in import\u2011competing sectors. | Lower tariffs, removal of quotas. |\n| **Supply\u2011chain integration** | Firms relocate parts of production to take advantage of lower input costs \u2192 new \u201cup\u2011stream\u201d or \u201cdown\u2011stream\u201d jobs (often in logistics, assembly). | Investment chapters, standards on customs, \u201csingle\u2011window\u201d procedures. |\n| **Skill\u2011biased technology diffusion** | Exposure to foreign firms and standards can spur adoption of more productive (often digital) technologies \u2192 higher demand for skilled workers, lower demand for routine low\u2011skill labour. | Intellectual\u2011property rules, \u201ctechnical\u2011barriers\u2011to\u2011trade\u201d provisions. |\n| **Wage/benefit standards in the agreement** | Some FTAs include labour\u2011rights chapters that require parties to uphold core ILO conventions, enforce collective\u2011bargaining, or adopt minimum\u2011wage laws. | \u201cLabour annexes\u201d (e.g., US\u2011MCA, US\u2011KORUS, EU\u2011Canada CETA). |\n| **Adjustment\u2011policy provisions** | Trade\u2011adjustment assistance (re\u2011training, unemployment benefits, relocation subsidies) is sometimes built into the treaty. | \u201cAdjustment assistance\u201d articles (e.g., NAFTA Chapter 19, US\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement). |\n| **Regulatory convergence** | Harmonisation of product\u2011safety, environmental, or health standards can raise production costs (potentially lowering wages) or improve workplace safety. | \u201cRegulatory cooperation\u201d sections. |\n\nThese mechanisms do not operate in isolation; the net effect on any given worker depends on the *interaction* of sectoral exposure, the worker\u2019s skill level, the strength of domestic labour institutions, and the existence (or lack) of adjustment programmes.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
