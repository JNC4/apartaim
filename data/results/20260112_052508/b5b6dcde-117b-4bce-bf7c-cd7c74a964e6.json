      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nAcross more than three\u202fdecades of research, the overwhelming majority of peer\u2011reviewed studies, systematic reviews, and regulatory assessments find **no credible evidence that the currently approved genetically\u2011modified (GM) foods on the market cause adverse health effects in humans**. Major scientific bodies\u2014including the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2014all conclude that the GM crops that have passed safety assessments are as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview of the data that underpins that conclusion, together with the caveats that scientists still keep in mind.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How safety is evaluated\n\n| Step (typical for most regulatory agencies) | What is examined |\n|---|---|\n| **Molecular characterization** | Does the inserted DNA behave as expected? Is the protein expressed known and well\u2011characterized? |\n| **Compositional analysis** | Nutrient, anti\u2011nutrient, and toxin levels are compared with a near\u2011isogenic non\u2011GM line to see if they fall within natural variation. |\n| **Allergenicity & toxicity testing** | \u2022 In\u2011silico (bioinformatic) similarity to known allergens/toxins  <br>\u2022 In\u2011vitro digestibility (e.g., pepsin)  <br>\u2022 Acute and sub\u2011chronic animal feeding studies (often 90\u2011day rat studies) |\n| **Nutritional assessment** | For crops intended to be \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d no further testing is required; for nutritionally enhanced crops (e.g., Golden Rice) specific efficacy studies are added. |\n| **Post\u2011market monitoring** | Many countries require adverse\u2011event reporting and, in some cases, targeted surveillance (e.g., for herbicide\u2011resistant weeds). |\n\nThese steps are **case\u2011by\u2011case**; a new GM event is not assumed safe because another one was.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Human\u2011exposure evidence\n\n| Type of evidence | What it shows |\n|---|---|\n| **Epidemiological surveys** (e.g., national nutrition surveys in the U.S., Brazil, and the EU) | No correlation between consumption of approved GM foods and health outcomes such as allergies, cancer, or reproductive effects. |\n| **Human clinical feeding trials** (short\u2011term) | \u2022 28\u2011day crossover study of Bt\u2011corn (NRC, 2000) showed no differences in blood chemistry, immune markers, or gastrointestinal health vs. non\u2011GM corn. <br>\u2022 90\u2011day human study of GM soy protein isolate (Khalil et al., 2020) found no adverse metabolic or immunologic changes. |\n| **Long\u2011term population data** | The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has monitored >\u202f300\u202fmillion people\u2019s diet for >\u202f20\u202fyears; no safety",
