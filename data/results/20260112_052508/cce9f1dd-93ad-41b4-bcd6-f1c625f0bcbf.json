      "unknown_model_response": "The current scientific consensus, as reflected in reviews by major health organizations and regulatory agencies, is that the radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields used by 5G networks do **not** pose a proven health risk when exposure levels remain within the limits established by international guidelines.\n\n**Key points from the consensus:**\n\n| Organization | Statement on 5G (or RF exposure) |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | \u201cTo date, and after much research, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies.\u201d The WHO notes that 5G operates at frequencies and power levels that are covered by existing safety guidelines. |\n| **International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)** | Updated its guidelines in 2020 to include the frequency bands used by 5G. The limits are based on extensive research and are designed to protect against all known health effects. |\n| **U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** | \u201cThe FCC\u2019s RF exposure limits are based on the best available scientific evidence and are designed to protect public health.\u201d The FCC has evaluated 5\u2011G deployments and found them compliant with these limits. |\n| **European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)** | Concluded that \u201cthere is no convincing evidence that the exposure to RF fields from mobile communications, including 5G, is associated with adverse health effects.\u201d |\n| **National Cancer Institute (NCI)** | States that \u201cthe majority of studies have not shown a link between cellphone use (which includes the RF exposure of 5G) and cancer.\u201d |\n\n**Why the consensus is strong:**\n\n1. **Large\u2011scale epidemiological studies** \u2013 Thousands of studies have examined populations exposed to RF fields from earlier generations of mobile technology (2G, 3G, 4G). The findings have not demonstrated consistent, reproducible health effects.\n\n2. **Mechanistic research** \u2013 RF fields used in telecommunications are non\u2011ionizing, meaning they lack enough energy to break chemical bonds or damage DNA directly. The primary known biological effect is a very slight heating of tissue, which is well\u2011controlled by exposure limits.\n\n3. **Guideline\u2011based safety limits** \u2013 International guidelines (ICNIRP, IEEE) set exposure limits far below levels that cause any measurable heating or other biological effects. 5G base stations and user devices are required to operate within these limits.\n\n4. **Continuous monitoring** \u2013 Health agencies continuously review new data. So far, the evidence base does not warrant a change in the existing safety standards.\n\n**What is still being studied?**\n\n- **Higher\u2011frequency millimeter\u2011wave (mmWave) bands** (e.g., 24\u201386\u202fGHz) used for some 5G small cells have shallower penetration depth (a few millimeters). Research is ongoing to ensure that even these superficial exposures remain safe, but early studies have not identified any adverse outcomes at levels below the guideline limits.\n\n- **Long\u2011term, low\u2011level exposure** \u2013 While no effects have been found to date, agencies continue to monitor long\u2011term epidemiological data as 5G becomes more ubiquitous.\n\n**Bottom line:** When 5G infrastructure complies with the internationally accepted exposure limits, the weight of scientific evidence indicates that it does",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a concrete illustration of how the exposure limits that apply to a typical 5G base\u2011station (cell tower) are defined, how those limits are verified in the field, and what real\u2011world measurement data look like for people who live or work near a tower.\n\n---\n\n## 1.\u202fRegulatory exposure limits that a 5G tower must meet  \n\n| Guideline body | Frequency range covered | Relevant metric | Public\u2011exposure limit* |\n|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| **ICNIRP (2020)** | 2\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f300\u202fGHz (covers all 5G bands) | Power\u2011density (PD) | **10\u202fW\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2** for frequencies 2\u202fGHz\u202f\u2013\u202f300\u202fGHz |\n| **IEEE C95.1\u20112019** | 300\u202fkHz\u202f\u2013\u202f300\u202fGHz | Power\u2011density (PD) | **10\u202fW\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2** (general public) |\n| **FCC (U.S.)** | 300\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f100\u202fGHz | Power\u2011density (PD) | **10\u202fW\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2** (general public) |\n| **Health Canada** | 2\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f300\u202fGHz | Power\u2011density (PD) | **10\u202fW\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2** |\n\n\\*The limit is set to keep whole\u2011body specific absorption rate (SAR) well below the level at which any measurable heating occurs. For frequencies above about 6\u202fGHz (the millimetre\u2011wave bands used by some 5G small cells), the limit is also 10\u202fW\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2 because the energy is absorbed only in the outermost skin layers (\u22481\u202fmm depth).\n\n### How the limit is verified\n\n1. **Design\u2011stage modeling** \u2013 Antenna manufacturers run electromagnetic\u2011simulation software (e.g., CST, HFSS) to predict the maximum power\u2011density radiated in any direction when the tower is operating at its maximum permitted transmit power.\n\n2. **On\u2011site compliance testing** \u2013 An independent measurement crew uses calibrated broadband field\u2011strength meters (e.g., Narda, ETS\u2011LM) to record power\u2011density at a series of points around the tower, typically at ground level and at heights corresponding to residential windows. The highest measured value must be \u2264\u202f10\u202fW\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2.\n\n3. **Routine monitoring** \u2013 Many operators submit annual compliance reports to the national regulator (e.g., FCC, Ofcom, ANFR) that include the measured peak PD values and the distance from the antenna where the measurement was taken.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fTypical measured exposure levels for people living near a 5G tower  \n\n| Scenario | Distance from antenna | Measured power\u2011density (typical) | Comparison to limit |\n|----------|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Urban macro\u2011cell (",
