At the same time, scientists continue to call for **case\u2011by\u2011case, transparent, long\u2011term monitoring** of each new trait, and a minority of researchers argue that the existing data are still insufficient to rule out rare or delayed effects.\n\nBelow is a\u202fconcise, evidence\u2011based overview of what the research says, the weight of the consensus, the main lines of debate, and where uncertainties remain.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
