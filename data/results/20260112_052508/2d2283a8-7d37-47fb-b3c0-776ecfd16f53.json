      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\n- **The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)** classifies **processed red meat** (e.g., bacon, sausage, ham) as **\u201ccarcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group\u202f1)** and **unprocessed red meat** (beef, pork, lamb, veal) as **\u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d (Group\u202f2A)**.  \n- The strongest and most consistent association is with **colorectal cancer**; smaller\u2011to\u2011moderate increases have also been reported for pancreatic and prostate cancers.  \n- The **absolute increase in risk** for a typical Western diet is modest: eating about\u202f50\u202fg of processed meat daily for 20\u202fyears is estimated to raise colorectal\u2011cancer risk by roughly **10\u202f%\u201320\u202f%** (\u22481 extra case per 1,000 people).  \n- The risk appears to rise with **higher intake**, **more frequent high\u2011temperature cooking**, and **greater consumption of processed products**.  \n- Red\u2011meat intake is also a source of essential nutrients (protein, iron, zinc, vitamin\u202fB12), so the decision to limit it should weigh both potential harms and nutritional benefits.\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the evidence is evaluated\n\n| Source | Classification | What it means |\n|--------|----------------|--------------|\n| **IARC (WHO)** | Processed red meat \u2013 *Group\u202f1* (carcinogenic). Unprocessed red meat \u2013 *Group\u202f2A* (probably carcinogenic). | Group\u202f1: sufficient evidence that the agent can cause cancer in humans. Group\u202f2A: limited evidence in humans but strong evidence in animals or mechanistic data. |\n| **US Dietary Guidelines (2020\u20112025)** | \u201cLimit intake of processed meat and red meat.\u201d | Recommendations are based on the same IARC assessment plus large\u2011scale cohort data. |\n| **American Cancer Society (ACS)** | \u201cStrong evidence that processed meat increases colorectal\u2011cancer risk; moderate evidence for unprocessed red meat.\u201d | Provides practical intake limits (\u2264\u202f18\u202foz cooked red meat per week; \u2264\u202f2\u202foz processed meat per week). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
