How sanctions are supposed to work (theoretical mechanisms)\n\n| Mechanism | What it means in practice | Typical policy tools |\n|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Economic coercion** | Reducing the target\u2019s ability to finance undesirable behavior (e.g., war, nuclear program) by cutting off revenue streams, limiting access to finance, or raising the cost of imports. | Trade embargoes, asset freezes, banking restrictions, oil export bans. |\n| **Political signaling** | Demonstrating international disapproval, thereby isolating the regime and raising its domestic political cost. | Diplomatic downgrades, travel bans, exclusion from international organisations. |\n| **Domestic pressure** | Creating inflation, shortages, or unemployment that increase public dissatisfaction and pressure elites to change policy. | Broad\u2011based sanctions that affect consumer goods, energy, or food. |\n| **Deterrence / Norm\u2011building** | Establishing a precedent that certain actions will trigger punitive measures, discouraging future violations. | Repeated use of similar sanction packages (e.g., non\u2011proliferation sanctions). |\n| **Punishment** | Retaliatory measure intended to make the target \u201cpay\u201d for a transgression, even if policy change is not expected. | One\u2011off \u201cpunitive\u201d sanctions after a breach of an agreement. |\n\n*The literature (e.g., Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott\u202f2009; Peksen\u202f2019) emphasizes that **the effectiveness of any mechanism depends on the target\u2019s political structure, economic openness, and availability of alternative partners**.*\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The example is drawn from the 2014\u20112015 round of sanctions that the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations imposed on Iran\u2019s nuclear\u2011related activities, and the subsequent negotiation of the **JCPOA** in July\u202f2015.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What the sanctions looked like\n\n| Dimension | How it was \u201csmart\u201d |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| **Scope** | Not a blanket trade embargo.  The measures were **limited to**: <br>\u2022 Iran\u2019s **oil\u2011export sector** (a 0.5\u202f% annual export ceiling) <br>\u2022 **Banking and finance** \u2013 cutting Iranian banks off from the SWIFT system and freezing the assets of designated Iranian financial institutions <br>\u2022 **Key petro\u2011chemical and metal firms** that were linked to the nuclear programme <br>\u2022 **Individuals and entities** (\u2248\u202f600) involved in nuclear procurement, weapons\u2011related technology, or the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s Quds Force. |\n| **Multilateral coordination** | The sanctions were **synchronised** across the U.S., EU, and UN Security Council (Resolution\u202f2231).  Because the UN resolution required *all* member states to enforce the measures, Iran could not simply shift its oil sales to a single non\u2011aligned market. |\n| **Legal precision** | Each target was identified by **name, registration number, or unique corporate identifier**.  The language of the UN resolution and the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) orders left little room for \u201cover\u2011inclusive\u201d spill\u2011overs. |\n| **Link to a diplomatic \u201ccarrot\u201d** | The sanctions package was **explicitly presented as a lever**: *if Iran complied with the nuclear\u2011related demands of the P5+1, the restrictions would be lifted* (the \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d design).  The United Nations Security Council resolution explicitly referenced \u201cthe possibility of a comprehensive nuclear\u2011related agreement.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
