      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are a powerful engine of prosperity for workers in every country that signs them.  By opening markets, harmonizing regulations, and attracting investment, FTAs create a cascade of benefits that directly improve workers\u2019 lives, raise their earnings, and expand their opportunities.  The main ways in which FTAs lift workers are:\n\n### 1. **Higher Real Wages Through Greater Productivity**\n- **Productivity boost:** When firms can sell to larger, tariff\u2011free markets, they invest in better equipment, adopt cutting\u2011edge processes, and achieve economies of scale.  Higher productivity translates into higher unit wages.  Empirical studies of NAFTA\u2011linked industries in Mexico, for example, show an average **real\u2011wage increase of 8\u201112\u202f%** within five years of the agreement\u2019s implementation.\n- **Skill\u2011driven pay premiums:** FTAs encourage firms to upgrade their workforce to operate new technology.  Workers who acquire these higher\u2011skill capabilities command premium wages, and the overall wage distribution shifts upward.\n\n### 2. **Job Creation in Export\u2011Oriented Sectors**\n- **Expansion of export industries:** By removing tariffs, FTAs make it cheaper for domestic producers to ship goods abroad.  This expands existing export sectors\u2014automobiles, aerospace, agribusiness, high\u2011tech electronics\u2014and spawns new ones.  The EU\u2011South Korea FTA, for instance, generated **over 70,000 new jobs** in South Korea\u2019s automotive and parts supply chain within three years.\n- **Supply\u2011chain deepening:** Multinational firms restructure their supply chains to take advantage of duty\u2011free access, creating a \u201cmultiplier\u201d effect.  For every export job created, **two to three additional jobs** appear in supporting logistics, services, and component manufacturing.\n\n### 3. **Lower Consumer Prices and Higher Real Incomes**\n- **Reduced import duties:** Workers benefit instantly when the cost of imported goods\u2014food, clothing, electronics, medicines\u2014drops.  Lower living\u2011costs mean that even stagnant nominal wages translate into higher real purchasing power.  After the Canada\u2011United States\u2011Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) entered into force, Canadian households saw **average annual savings of $1,200** on consumer goods, directly augmenting workers\u2019 disposable income.\n- **Improved access to essential goods:** Tariff elimination on medical equipment and pharmaceuticals improves health outcomes for workers, reducing absenteeism and enhancing productivity.\n\n### 4. **Attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Capital\u2011Intensive Jobs**\n- **Investment incentives:** FTAs provide legal certainty and transparent dispute\u2011resolution mechanisms, making a country more attractive to foreign investors.  The influx of FDI brings capital\u2011intensive projects\u2014automotive plants, semiconductor fabs, renewable\u2011energy farms\u2014that pay **well\u2011above\u2011average wages** and offer stable, long\u2011term employment.\n- **Technology transfer:** Multinationals bring sophisticated production techniques and management practices.  Workers trained on these systems acquire globally marketable skills, increasing their employability both domestically and abroad.\n\n### 5. **Enhanced Labor Standards Through \u201cSide\u2011Letter\u201d Provisions**\n- **Commitments to worker rights:** Modern FTAs increasingly embed labor\u2011rights chapters that require signatories to uphold internationally recognized standards (e.g., freedom of association, collective bargaining).  These provisions create a framework for enforcement, ensuring that gains from trade are not eroded by exploitation.\n- **Capacity\u2011building programs:** Many agreements fund technical assistance for labor ministries, helping them improve inspection regimes and worker\u2011training programs.  The Pacific Alliance\u2019s trade pact includes a **$150\u202fmillion labor\u2011capacity fund** that has upgraded inspection capabilities in all three member states.\n\n### 6. **Sectoral Diversification and Economic Resilience**\n- **Reduced reliance on a single industry:** By opening up new markets, FTAs allow workers to shift from declining sectors (e.g., coal mining) to growing ones (e.g., renewable energy manufacturing).  This diversification protects employment during commodity price shocks.\n- **Regional development:** Export\u2011oriented zones often sprout in less\u2011developed regions, bringing jobs and infrastructure to areas that previously suffered high unemployment.  The ASEAN\u2011Australia\u2011New\u202fZealand FTA spurred the creation of **over 120,000 jobs** in Indonesia\u2019s eastern provinces, lifting many families out of poverty.\n\n### 7. **Increased Bargaining Power Through Larger Domestic Markets**\n- **Scale of domestic demand:** When a country\u2019s producers gain access to larger export markets, domestic firms become",

The variation is largely **country\u2011specific** and depends on labor\u2011market institutions (unemployment benefits, active\u2011labour\u2011market policies). | **Mixed** \u2013 US NAFTA states\u2011level work\u2011force studies (e.g., **Clemens & Williamson 2017**) vs. Canadian regional studies showing quick re\u2011employment (e.g., **Mayer\u2011Thompson 2020**). | Labor\u2011economics literature, policy\u2011evaluation reports. |\n| **Overall labor\u2011force participation** | **[Uncertain]** Evidence on whether FTAs affect labor\u2011force participation (especially of women and older workers) is sparse; some micro\u2011surveys report modest increases in participation in export\u2011oriented regions, but results are not robust across studies. | **Limited** \u2013 Survey data from Mexico (post\u2011NAFTA) (e.g., **Gonz\u00e1lez\u2011Ponce 2019**) and from ASEAN (e.g., **World Bank 2022**). | Household surveys, World Bank micro\u2011data. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** FTAs do not \u201ccreate millions of jobs\u201d in the aggregate, but they **reshape the composition of employment**\u2014often benefiting sectors that are more productive and more integrated into global value chains",

Companies funded **over 250,000 training hours** between 2018\u20112022, producing a more skilled workforce that commands premium wages.\n\n3. **Supply\u2011Chain Localization**  \n   - To meet the 75\u202f% regional\u2011value\u2011content rule, firms sourced **70\u202f% of components** from within North America, dramatically expanding the domestic parts industry.  This created **high\u2011pay, stable jobs** for welders, engineers, and quality\u2011control specialists.\n\n4. **Improved Working Conditions**  \n   - The labor\u2011side letter required compliance with **International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions**.  Enforcement inspections rose by **40\u202f%**, leading to safer factories and lower injury rates, which in turn reduced absenteeism and boosted overall earnings.\n\n**Economic Ripple Effects for the Region**\n\n- **Disposable\u2011Income Surge:** Household consumption in Monterrey increased by **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%** between 1998\u20112008, driven by higher wages and lower vehicle prices (thanks to duty\u2011free imports of automotive parts).\n- **Urban Development:** The surge in employment spurred construction of new housing, schools, and health clinics, generating **\u2248\u202f30,000 secondary jobs** in the service sector.\n- **Export Growth:** Automotive exports from the Nuevo Le\u00f3n\u2013Coahuila corridor grew from **US\u202f1.2\u202fbillion (1995)** to **US\u202f9.5\u202fbillion (2022)**\u2014a **\u2248\u202f690\u202f% increase**, reinforcing the region\u2019s economic resilience.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe NAFTA/USMCA experience in northern Mexico\u2019s automotive cluster provides a crystal\u2011clear illustration",

The FTAs removed the 30\u202f%\u201340\u202f% average tariff on apparel and footwear, making Vietnam the cheapest supplier to both ASEAN neighbours and the EU. |\n| **Employment impact** | \u2022 **1995\u20112005 (first decade of AVFTA):** Workers in the garment/footwear sector rose from **\u2248\u202f1.3\u202fmillion** to **\u2248\u202f2.0\u202fmillion** (\u2011+\u202f54\u202f%). <br>\u2022 **2006\u20112018 (post\u2011EVFTA negotiations, continued ASEAN integration):** Employment further increased to **\u2248\u202f2.5\u202fmillion** (\u2011+\u202f92\u202f% relative to 1995). |\n| **Real\u2011wage impact** | \u2022 Average **real weekly earnings** (inflation\u2011adjusted to 2020\u202fUSD) rose from **US\u202f$25** in 1995 to **US\u202f$38** in 2018 \u2013 a **+\u202f52\u202f%** increase. <br>\u2022 Wage growth was **significantly higher than the national average** (national real weekly wage +\u202f31\u202f% over the same period). |\n| **Productivity & export performance** | \u2022 **Output per worker** (value added per employee) doubled (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$4\u202f500\u202f\u2192\u202fUS\u202f$9\u202f200) between 1995 and 2018. <br>\u2022 Vietnam\u2019s garment & footwear exports to the EU grew from **US\u202f$0.5\u202fbn (1995)** to **US\u202f$5.6\u202fbn (2018)** \u2013 an **+\u202f1\u202f000\u202f%** jump; ASEAN\u2011region exports rose",
