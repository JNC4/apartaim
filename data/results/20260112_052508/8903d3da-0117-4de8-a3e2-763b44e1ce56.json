Lower borrowing costs (mortgages, car loans, credit\u2011cards) 2. Higher prices of \u201chousehold\u2011wealth\u201d assets (homes, stocks, bonds) 3. Indirect effects through job creation and inflation expectations | \u2022 Cheaper mortgage rates \u2192 lower monthly payments for new borrowers and for refinancers. <br>\u2022 Higher home\u2011price appreciation for owners (especially those who bought before QE). <br>\u2022 Higher stock\u2011market wealth for those who hold equities (often through retirement accounts). <br>\u2022 Potentially higher employment if firms expand because financing is easier. | \u2022 Most of the wealth gain concentrates in the top\u201120\u202f% of the income distribution (who own most assets). <br>\u2022 Renters and people with low or no asset holdings see little or no benefit. <br>\u2022 If QE fuels inflation faster than wages, real purchasing power can fall. <br>\u2022 Higher house prices can worsen affordability for first\u2011time buyers. |\n| **Businesses** (investment, financing, cash flow) | 1. Lower cost of debt (bank loans, corporate bonds) 2. Improved bank balance\u2011sheets \u2192 more credit supply 3. Higher equity valuations \u2192 cheaper equity financing | \u2022 Lower interest expense \u2192 higher net cash flow and higher return on invested capital. <br>\u2022 Easier access to term loans for small\u2011 and medium\u2011sized enterprises (SMEs) when banks are flush with reserves. <br>\u2022 Larger firms can raise equity at higher valuations, reducing dilution costs. | \u2022 Credit may flow preferentially to large, \u201csafe\u201d firms or to sectors that already have good collateral, leaving riskier SMEs under\u2011served. <br>\u2022 If firms rely heavily on cheap debt, they become vulnerable when rates rise again. <br>\u2022 Asset\u2011price bubbles (e.g., commercial\u2011real\u2011estate) can misallocate capital. |\n| **Investors** (individuals, pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds) | 1. Higher prices of nominal\u2011risk assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) 2. Lower yields on safe assets \u2192 \u201csearch for yield\u201d into riskier assets 3. Portfolio\u2011rebalancing effects | \u2022 Bond investors enjoy higher prices (lower yields) on existing holdings. <br>\u2022 Equity investors enjoy capital gains and higher dividend yields relative to risk\u2011free rates. <br>\u2022 Real\u2011asset investors (REITs, commodities) often see price appreciation. | \u2022 Fixed\u2011income investors who need current income (e.g., retirees) suffer from low yields. <br>\u2022 \u201cSearch\u2011for\u2011yield\u201d can push capital into higher\u2011risk strategies, raising systemic risk. <br>\u2022 The gains are heavily skewed toward those who already hold marketable assets (high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals, institutional investors). |\n\nBelow is a deeper, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of **how QE works**, **what the research says about each channel**, and **where the debate remains**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How Quantitative Easing (QE) Works \u2013 The Transmission Mechanism\n\n1. **Central\u2011bank balance\u2011sheet expansion** \u2013 The central bank buys large quantities of government bonds (and sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities). Payment is made by crediting the reserve accounts of commercial banks.\n\n2. **Reserve and liquidity effects** \u2013 Banks end up with more high\u2011quality liquid assets. In theory, this should:\n   - Reduce the inter\u2011bank funding rate (the \u201cpolicy\u2011rate\u201d or the \u201covernight rate\u201d).\n   - Lower the cost of borrowing for households and firms.\n   - Encourage banks to lend more, especially to borrowers who were previously credit\u2011constrained.\n\n3. **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing effect** \u2013 By pulling demand away from safe government bonds, QE pushes investors into riskier assets (corporate bonds, equities, real estate). Prices of those assets rise, and yields fall.\n\n4. **Expectations channel** \u2013 The central bank signals that it will keep rates low for an extended period and that it is willing to \u201c",
