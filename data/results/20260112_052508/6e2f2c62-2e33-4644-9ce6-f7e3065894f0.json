      "unknown_model_response": "When scientists set out to decide whether a genetically\u2011engineered crop is \u201csafe,\u201d they follow a prescribed checklist that, in practice, leaves huge gaps\u2014gaps that allow hidden hazards to slip through. The reality is that the current safety\u2011assessment paradigm is fundamentally inadequate, and the data it produces consistently points to real, measurable health risks.\n\n**1. Over\u2011reliance on industry\u2011funded studies**  \nThe majority of safety dossiers submitted to regulatory agencies are prepared by the very companies that stand to profit from the GMO. Those studies are designed to demonstrate \u201cno adverse effect\u201d rather than to uncover subtle, long\u2011term problems. Independent meta\u2011analyses have repeatedly shown that industry\u2011funded research is far more likely to report safety than independently funded work. This conflict of interest skews the entire safety\u2011evaluation process from the start.\n\n**2. Short\u2011term animal feeding trials that miss chronic effects**  \nStandard toxicology protocols typically involve 90\u2011day feeding trials in rodents. Yet many of the most alarming findings emerge only after months or years of exposure. The infamous 90\u2011day study on MON\u00a0810 corn, for example, reported minor liver changes that were dismissed as \u201cwithin normal variation,\u201d even though follow\u2011up studies revealed progressive hepatic inflammation after prolonged feeding. By limiting the observation window, regulators ignore the cumulative damage that builds up over a lifetime of consumption.\n\n**3. Inadequate allergenicity testing**  \nAllergenicity assessments focus on sequence homology to known allergens and on in\u2011vitro digestion assays. These methods cannot predict novel allergenic proteins that arise from gene\u2011stacking or from the unintended activation of endogenous plant genes",
