      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nMost major health organisations now consider **processed red meat** (e.g., bacon, sausages, cured ham) a *probable* cause of cancer and **unprocessed red meat** (e.g., beef, pork, lamb) a *possible* cause. The strongest and most consistent link is with **colorectal cancer**, but smaller\u2011to\u2011moderate increases have also been reported for pancreatic, prostate and, in some studies, breast cancer. The absolute increase in risk for most people is modest, and the evidence is based mainly on large observational (cohort and case\u2011control) studies rather than randomized trials.\n\nBelow is a concise synthesis of the current evidence, the biological plausibility, the size of the effect, and what major bodies recommend.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
