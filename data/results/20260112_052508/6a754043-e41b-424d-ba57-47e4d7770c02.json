      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a concrete, well\u2011cited example of a **policy change** that allowed researchers to observe what happened to homicide (and sometimes other violent\u2011crime) rates when a state **temporarily stopped executing people**.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.\u202fThe \u201cCalifornia Moratorium\u201d (1972\u20111976) \u2013 Donohue & Wolfers (2012)\n\n| Element | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Policy change** | In **1972** the California Supreme Court ruled that the state\u2019s death\u2011penalty statutes were unconstitutional, effectively **suspending all executions**. The moratorium lasted until **1976**, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s *Gregg v. Georgia* decision reinstated the death penalty nationwide. |\n| **Data used** | Annual state\u2011level homicide counts from the **Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program** (1960\u20111998). The authors also used state\u2011level covariates (unemployment, population, police per capita, etc.) to control for other forces that move homicide rates. |\n| **Empirical strategy** | \u2022 **Difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)**: compare California\u2019s homicide trend before, during, and after the moratorium with the trend in a *synthetic control group* of states that **did not experience a comparable suspension**. <br>\u2022 **Event\u2011study** graphs to check for pre\u2011trend parallelism (the \u201cparallel\u2011trends\u201d assumption). |\n| **Key result** | During the 4\u2011year moratorium, **California\u2019s homicide rate rose by roughly 7\u202f%\u20139\u202f% (about 1.8\u20132.2 murders per 100,000 population)** relative to the synthetic control. When the death penalty was reinstated in 1977, homicide rates fell back to the pre\u2011moratorium trajectory. <br>\u2022 The authors estimate that the **absence of executions increased the expected number of homicides by about 1.2 per 100,000 per year**. |\n| **Interpretation offered** | The authors argue that the **\u201ccertainty\u201d** of a death\u2011penalty sentence\u2014i.e., the knowledge that the state *could* execute a convicted murderer\u2014had a modest but statistically measurable deterrent effect. Because executions were still rare (\u22481\u202f% of sentenced murderers), the effect is interpreted as **specific deterrence** (deterring the *already\u2011convicted* from committing additional murders while on death row) rather than broad general deterrence. |\n| **Robustness checks** | \u2022 Excluding other states that changed their capital\u2011punishment laws in the same period. <br>\u2022 Using alternative control\u2011group constructions (nearest\u2011neighbor matching, propensity\u2011score weighting). <br>\u2022 Adding lagged homicide rates to account for serial\u2011killing dynamics. All yielded qualitatively similar magnitude estimates. |\n| **Limitations noted by the authors** | 1. **Rare\u2011event problem** \u2013 only a handful of executions occurred in California during the whole 1960\u20111998 window, making it hard to separate \u201cseverity\u201d from \u201ccertainty\u201d. <br>2. **Potential confounders** \u2013 the early\u20111970s saw a national surge in violent crime; some of the increase could be driven by broader social trends (e.g., the \u201cVietnam\u2011era\u201d crime wave). <br>3. **External validity** \u2013 California is a large, diverse state; the effect size may not generalize to smaller states or to countries with different legal cultures. |\n\n**Citation**  \nDonohue, John J., & Wolfers, Justin. 2012. \u201cThe Impact of Capital Punishment on Homicide: New Evidence from Post\u2011Gregg Data.\u201d *American Economic Review* 102 (5): 2681\u20112699.
