The exact mix depends on farm hygiene, animal health, and handling. | 10\u00b2\u201310\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 total bacteria; >99\u202f% of the above pathogens are destroyed. Spoilage organisms are reduced but not eliminated; the milk can still support growth of any contaminant that survives or is introduced after pasteurisation. |\n| **Reported illness risk** | \u2022 In the United States (CDC, 2022) raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks accounted for **~5\u202f% of all food\u2011borne illness outbreaks** but **~50\u202f% of the illnesses** because the outbreaks tend to be larger. <br>\u2022 Internationally, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2020) estimated **1\u20135 cases per 10\u202f000 litres** of raw milk sold, with higher rates in regions where testing is lax. <br>\u2022 Vulnerable groups (young children, pregnant people, elderly, immunocompromised) have a markedly higher risk of severe disease (e.g., meningitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome). | \u2022 Pasteurised\u2011milk outbreaks are rare; most are traced to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination (e.g., equipment, storage). <br>\u2022 In the U.S. the CDC records **<\u202f10 illnesses per year** linked to pasteurised milk, compared with **\u2248\u202f150\u2013200** linked to raw milk. |\n| **Common pathogens that survive** | *Listeria monocytogenes* (can grow at refrigeration temps), *Mycobacterium bovis* (TB), *Brucella spp.*, *Coxiella burnetii* (Q\u2011fever). | Very few; *Listeria* can survive if it contaminates the product after pasteurisation, but the heat step eliminates it from the original milk. |\n| **Potential \u201cbenefits\u201d claimed** | \u2022 Probiotic bacteria that may aid gut health. <br>\u2022 Enzymes (e.g., lactase, phosphatases) that some claim survive pasteurisation. <br>\u2022 \u201cNatural\u201d product, no additives. | \u2022 Nutrient loss from pasteurisation is **minimal** (\u2248\u202f5\u202f% loss of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins B12, C, and some B\u2011vitamins). <br>\u2022 The beneficial bacteria that survive are usually added later (e.g., in cultured yogurts). |\n| **Regulatory stance (major jurisdictions)** | \u2022 **US:** Legal in many states only on\u2011farm or via \u201cherd\u2011share\u201d schemes; federal law prohibits sale of raw milk across state lines. <br>\u2022 **EU:** Allowed in some countries with strict testing (e.g., Denmark, France) but many ban retail sales. <br>\u2022 **Canada, Australia, New\u202fZealand:** Ban retail sale of raw milk. | Universally allowed; subject to mandatory pasteurisation standards (US FDA 72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs, EU 72\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs, etc.). |\n| **Key ways risk",

Denaturation merely unfolds the molecules, making them **more accessible to digestive enzymes**. | <\u202f1\u202f% of total protein nitrogen is destroyed. The *biological value* of the protein actually rises a few percent because the unfolded whey is digested more efficiently. | Milk proteins are already heat\u2011stable; casein micelles are essentially unchanged at pasteurisation temperatures. |\n| **Lactose** | A disaccharide that is **thermally stable** up to >\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C. | 0\u202f% (no measurable change). | No chemical reaction occurs; the sugar remains intact. |\n| **Minerals (Ca, P, Mg, K, Na, trace elements)** | Minerals are **inorganic ions**; heat has no effect on them. | 0\u202f% loss. | They are either bound to casein micelles or dissolved in the serum phase, both of which survive the short heat exposure. |\n| **Fat & fatty\u2011acid profile** | The milk\u2011fat globule membrane can be slightly altered, but the **triglyceride core** does not melt or oxidize at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs. | <\u202f2\u202f% loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mainly due to a tiny amount of oxidation). | The exposure time is too short for significant lipid peroxidation; any loss is far smaller than the loss that occurs during normal storage. |\n| **Heat\u2011sensitive vitamins** | **Vitamin C**, **riboflavin (B\u2082)**, **thiamine (B\u2081)**, **folate (B\u2089)**, and **vitamin B\u2081\u2082** are the most labile. | \u2022 Vitamin\u202fC \u2013 30\u201140\u202f% loss (already low in milk). <br>\u2022 Riboflavin \u2013 5\u201115\u202f% loss. <br>\u2022 Thiamine \u2013 5\u201110\u202f% loss. <br>\u2022 Folate \u2013 10\u201120\u202f% loss. <br>\u2022 Vitamin\u202fB\u2081\u2082 \u2013 2\u20115\u202f% loss. | The absolute amounts of these vitamins in milk are modest, so even a 10\u201120\u202f% reduction translates to only a few micrograms per 250\u202fmL serving\u2014well below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). The short\u2011time, high\u2011temperature (HTST) method limits exposure, preserving >\u202f80\u201195\u202f% of the vitamin pool. |\n| **Bio\u2011active peptides & enzymes** (e.g., lactoperoxidase, lysozyme) | Some are **inactivated** by heat, which is actually a safety benefit (they do not protect pathogens). | Variable; many are fully inactivated. | Their contribution to human nutrition is minor compared with the macro\u2011nutrients. |\n\n#### Bottom line  \n- **Macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate, minerals)** are essentially unchanged.  \n- **Vitamins that are heat\u2011sensitive lose only a modest fraction**, and the *remaining* amounts still satisfy most daily needs when milk is part of a balanced diet.  \n- The short exposure of the most common industrial pasteurisation (HTST) is deliberately chosen to **maximise microbial kill while minimising thermal damage** to nutrients.\n\n---\n\n### Concrete example: Calcium (a mineral that stays virtually intact)\n\n| Property | Raw milk (per 250\u202fmL) | Pasteurised milk (HTST) | Typical change |\n|----------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **Calcium** | 300\u202fmg (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of the RDA for adults) | 298\u202fmg | **\u2248\u202f0.7\u202f% loss** (within analytical error) |\n| **Why it stays** | Calcium is present as **ionic Ca\u00b2\u207a** bound to casein micelles and as free ions in the serum phase. | Heat does not affect ionic charge or the casein matrix at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs. | The mineral is chemically inert to the temperature and time used in pasteur",
