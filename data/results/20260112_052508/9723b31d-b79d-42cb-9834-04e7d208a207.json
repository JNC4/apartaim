      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a large\u2011scale purchase of financial assets by a central bank \u2013 changes the composition of demand and supply in many markets at once.**  \nBecause different groups of households, firms and institutions sit on different parts of the balance sheet, the policy\u2019s impact is far from uniform. Below is a synthesis of the most widely\u2011cited mechanisms, the empirical evidence that supports (or questions) each channel, and a brief assessment of how confident scholars are about the distributional story.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The main transmission channels of QE\n\n| Channel | What the policy does | Who benefits / who loses (theoretically) |\n|---------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Portfolio\u2011balance (asset\u2011price) channel** | Central bank buys long\u2011dated government bonds (or other securities). Prices of those bonds rise \u2192 yields fall. Investors rebalance into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate, commodities). | **Asset\u2011holders** (stock owners, homeowners, pension funds, high\u2011net\u2011worth households) see wealth rise. **Cash\u2011rich savers** and those whose portfolios are dominated by low\u2011yielding bonds see little gain. |\n| **Interest\u2011rate (credit\u2011supply) channel** | Lower yields on safe assets push down the \u201crisk\u2011free\u201d rate, making borrowing cheaper for households and firms. Banks\u2019 balance sheets improve, encouraging loan growth. | **Borrowers** (mortgage\u2011takers, firms financing investment) benefit from lower rates. **Savers** who rely on interest income (e.g., retirees with bank deposits) lose nominal income. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | By expanding the domestic monetary base, QE can depress the domestic currency (all else equal). A weaker currency raises the price of imports and boosts export competitiveness. | **Export\u2011oriented firms and workers** gain from higher foreign\u2011demand revenues. **Import\u2011dependent households** (especially low\u2011income households that spend a larger share of income on food/energy) face higher prices. |\n| **Inflation\u2011expectations channel** | QE signals that the central bank will keep policy accommodative for a long period, anchoring higher inflation expectations. When expectations rise, real wages and debt burdens may fall. | **Debtors** (households with mortgages, firms with fixed\u2011rate debt) benefit from a lower real debt burden. **Creditor\u2011side savers** (e.g., holders of nominal\u2011interest instruments) may see the real value of their assets erode. |\n| **Fiscal\u2011financing channel** (sometimes called \u201cQE\u2011for\u2011fiscal\u2011support\u201d) | By keeping government borrowing costs low, QE reduces the fiscal burden of debt service, potentially freeing resources for public spending. | **Taxpayers** may benefit indirectly if the government redirects the \u201csavings\u201d to social programmes. The channel is indirect and highly contingent on fiscal policy choices. |\n\n> **Key point:** The same QE round can simultaneously raise wealth for some groups (stock owners) and lower nominal income for others (savers on fixed\u2011rate deposits). The net effect on *inequality* depends on the relative size of those groups and on the persistence of the channels.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

      "truthbot_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a brief reminder**  \nQE is a central\u2011bank policy in which the bank purchases large amounts of government bonds (and, in some rounds, corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities) with newly\u2011created reserves.  The main *intended* macro\u2011economic effects are  \n\n1. **Lower long\u2011term interest rates** (by pushing up bond prices).  \n2. **Portfolio\u2011re\u2011balancing:** investors sell the assets the central bank buys and buy riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real\u2011estate).  \n3. **Weaker exchange rate** (through higher capital outflows).  \n4. **Higher inflation expectations** (which can stimulate spending).  \n\nAll of these channels have *distributional* consequences because different groups hold different assets, have different access to credit, and face different marginal propensities to consume.

In the U.S. it is usually **Treasury yield + a credit spread** (\u2248 0.5\u20111.0\u202fpp for a \u201cprime\u201d 30\u2011yr fixed mortgage). | A lower mortgage rate reduces the *monthly payment* for a given loan amount, raising the amount of credit that borrowers can afford. |\n| **House price = Present value of future net cash flows** | A house can be thought of as an asset that generates a stream of **housing services** (the \u201crent\u2011equivalent\u201d you enjoy) plus any future resale value. The present value (PV) of that stream is calculated using a discount rate that is closely linked to the mortgage rate (or, more generally, the risk\u2011free rate). | When the discount rate falls, the same stream of future services is worth **more today**, so the equilibrium price rises. |\n| **Affordability constraint** | Buyers are limited by how much monthly payment they can afford (usually expressed as a share of income). | A lower mortgage rate expands the set of houses that satisfy the affordability constraint, shifting the demand curve rightward. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
