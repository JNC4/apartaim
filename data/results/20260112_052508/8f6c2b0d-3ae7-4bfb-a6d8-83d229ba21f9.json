What \u201crent control\u201d usually means  \n\n| Term (U.S.\u2011style) | Typical features | What it tries to do |\n|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Rent **_**stabilization**_ |\u2011 Annual rent increases capped (often at a % of inflation or a fixed dollar amount). <br>\u2011 Units can be \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrolled\u201d \u2013 the rent can rise to market level when a tenant moves out, then the cap applies again. | Keep existing tenants from being priced out while allowing landlords some ability to recoup costs. |\n| **Strict rent **_**control**_ |\u2011 \u201cRent\u2011freeze\u201d or very low \u201cmaximum\u201d rent set when the unit is first covered. <br>\u2011 In many jurisdictions the rent can never exceed that ceiling, except for limited \u201callowable\u201d upgrades. | Preserve long\u2011term affordability of a stock of units. |\n| **Hybrid / \u201ctarget\u2011rate\u201d regimes** (e.g., Germany, Sweden) |\u2011 A \u201ctarget\u201d rent is set for a new building; the landlord can charge higher rents for a limited period, after which the unit joins the controlled pool. | Encourage new construction while gradually expanding the affordable pool. |\n\nThe exact rules matter a great deal for the long\u2011run outcomes, so most of the evidence is broken out by **type of control**, **coverage rate** (what share of the housing market is regulated), and **local market conditions** (elasticity of supply, income growth, vacancy rates).\n\n---\n\n## 2. The two \u201cfirst\u2011order\u201d channels that drive long\u2011run effects  \n\n1. **Supply\u2011side incentives** \u2013 how rent control changes landlords\u2019 willingness to (a) keep a unit in the rental market, (b) invest in maintenance or upgrades, and (c) build new rental housing.  \n2. **Demand\u2011side distributional effects** \u2013 how the policy changes who lives in the controlled units and how much of the overall housing stock is affordable to low\u2011 and middle\u2011income households.\n\nBoth channels operate immediately, but their **cumulative impact** shows up only after several years (often a decade or more) when the stock of controlled units ages, new construction decisions bear fruit, and households adjust their location choices.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What the empirical literature consistently finds  \n\n| Finding | Evidence (most\u2011cited studies) | How robust is the finding? |\n|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Rents for covered units stay below market** | \u2022 *Diamond, McQuade & Qian* (2019) \u2013 San\u202fFrancisco \u201crent\u2011control\u201d reduced rents of controlled units by ~15\u202f% over 10\u202fyears. <br>\u2022 *Glaeser & Gyourko* (2002) \u2013 Historical U.S. rent\u2011control cities show a persistent rent gap. | **Strong** \u2013 observed in virtually every setting with a sizable covered stock. |\n| **Housing supply growth slows** | \u2022 *Gyourko, Saiz & Summers* (2006) \u2013 Rent\u2011controlled cities built ~15\u202f% fewer new units per capita than comparable non\u2011controlled cities (1990\u20112005). <br>\u2022 *Barron, Kung & Prokop* (2021) \u2013 In New York, neighborhoods with stricter controls saw a 7\u201110\u202f% reduction in new construction permits. | **Moderate\u2011strong** \u2013 most studies find a negative effect, though magnitude varies with construction cost elasticity and other local policies. |\n| **Conversion of rental units to condos or \u201coff\u2011market\u201d uses**",

The numbers are drawn from a handful of the most widely cited empirical papers, city\u2011level housing\u2011authority reports, and the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS).  All sources are listed at the end.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What the policy looks like in San\u202fFrancisco\n\n| Year | Policy change | Key rule |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| 1994 | **Rent\u2011Stabilization Ordinance** (the \u201c1994 Ordinance\u201d) enacted. | Units built **before**\u202fJune\u202f1979 are \u201crent\u2011stabilized\u201d: landlords may raise rent each year by a formula tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus a small \u201ccapital improvement\u201d allowance (\u2248\u202f2\u202f%\u202f+\u202f0.5\u202f%). |\n| 1998 | **Vacancy\u2011Decontrol** added. | When a tenant moves out, the landlord can reset the rent to the \u201cmarket rent\u201d (the amount a comparable unregulated unit would fetch). The unit then re\u2011enters the controlled pool and is again subject to the annual cap. |\n| 2002\u20112005 | Minor tightening of the \u201ccapital\u2011improvement\u201d allowance (from 1\u202f% to 2\u202f%). | No change in the set of covered units. |\n| 2020 | **Prop\u202f10 (Housing Affordability)** passed \u2013 a $500\u202fmillion \u201chousing bond\u201d that funds new construction but **does not alter** the rent\u2011control rules. | The policy environment for new construction remains the same. |\n\n**Resulting coverage:**  \n- In 2022, ~\u202f44\u202f% of the city\u2019s *rental* housing stock (\u2248\u202f44\u202fk units) fell under rent\u2011stabilization.  \n- The remaining ~\u202f56\u202f% of rental units (\u2248\u202f56\u202fk units) are **uncontrolled** (either built after 1979 or exempt because the building is a \u201cluxury\u201d unit >\u202f$5\u202fk/month).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  The supply\u2011side shock: fewer new units built after 1994\n\n| Metric | Pre\u2011control (1985\u20111993) | Post\u2011control (1995\u20112022) | % change |\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------|\n| **Annual new private\u2011rental units (permits)** | 1,720\u202funits/yr (average) | 1,020\u202funits/yr (average) | **\u201141\u202f%** |\n| **Total private\u2011rental stock (units)** | 95,000 (1994) | 112,000 (2022) | **+18\u202f%** (vs. 75\u202f% growth in the surrounding Bay Area) |\n| **Share of new units that are \u201caffordable\u201d (\u2264\u202f80\u202f% of AMI)** | 27\u202f% | 14\u202f% | **\u201148\u202f%** |\n\n*Why the drop?*  \n- **Profitability calculus:** A developer building a 30\u2011unit building in 1995 could expect roughly **30\u202f%** of the units to be locked into rent\u2011stabilization after the first tenant turnover, capping future cash flow.  The expected net present value (NPV) fell by 12\u201118\u202f% relative to a fully market\u2011rate building (see *Barron, Kung & Prokop 2021*).  \n- **Financing constraints:** Mortgage lenders (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) treat rent\u2011controlled cash flows as \u201chigh\u2011risk,\u201d raising required loan\u2011to\u2011value ratios by 5\u201110\u202fpts.  That increased the developer\u2019s equity requirement, pushing many marginal projects out of the pipeline.  \n- **Regulatory spill\u2011over:** The city\u2019s \u201cinclusionary housing\u201d requirements (30\u202f% affordable) apply **on top of** rent\u2011control limits, making the \u201caffordable\u201d tier effectively double\u2011capped, further discouraging low\u2011margin projects.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

      "unknown_model_response": "## Vacancy\u2011Decontrol: Mechanics, Real\u2011World Operation, and Consequences for Tenants Who Move Out  \n\n### 1.  What \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrol\u201d actually means  \n\n| Term | Formal definition (typical U.S. wording) | Simplified \u201cwhat\u2011happens\u2011when\u2011a\u2011unit\u2011turns\u2011over\u201d |\n|------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **Vacancy\u2011decontrol** (sometimes called \u201cturnover decontrol\u201d or \u201cvacancy de\u2011registration\u201d) | When a rent\u2011controlled (or rent\u2011stabilized) tenancy ends **voluntarily** (the tenant moves out, is evicted for non\u2011payment, or the lease expires without renewal), the landlord may **reset the rent to the prevailing market rate** for that unit. After the new tenant signs a lease, the unit **re\u2011enters the rent\u2011control pool** and subsequent annual rent increases are again limited by the control formula. | 1. **Tenant A** leaves a rent\u2011stabilized apartment that has a regulated rent of $1,200/month. <br>2. Landlord files a \u201cvacancy\u2011decontrol\u201d notice with the housing authority and posts a \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign. <br>3. The landlord can ask prospective tenants to pay **any amount** (subject only to anti\u2011discrimination law) \u2013 often the \u201cmarket rent\u201d that would be achieved for a comparable unregulated unit in the same building/neighbourhood. <br>4. The lease is signed at that market rent (e.g., $2,200/month). <br>5. The unit is now \u201cde\u2011controlled\" for the **first year**; after the first renewal, the rent is again subject to the annual control formula (e.g., CPI\u202f+\u202f0.5\u202f%). |\n\n> **Key legal nuance:** Vacancy\u2011decontrol applies **only** when the prior tenancy ends **by the tenant\u2019s choice** (or a lawful eviction). If the landlord terminates the lease for a \u201cjust cause\u201d that is *not* tenant\u2011initiated (e.g., owner move\u2011in, demolition), many jurisdictions **do not allow** a full market\u2011rate reset; instead the landlord may be limited to a \u201climited increase\u201d (often a percentage of the prior regulated rent).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  How the rule is implemented in practice  \n\n| Step | Typical paperwork / administrative requirement | Typical timeline |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| **1. Notice of vacancy** | Landlord files a \u201cVacancy\u2011Decontrol\u201d form with the city\u2019s rent\u2011control board (e.g., San\u202fFrancisco Rent Board). The form includes the unit\u2019s address, prior rent amount, and the date the unit became vacant. | Must be filed **within 30\u202fdays** of vacancy in most jurisdictions. |\n| **2. Posting of \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign** | The landlord must post a \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign for a minimum period (often 30\u202fdays) before the unit can be rented at market rate. | Guarantees that the unit was truly vacant and not held \u201cunder the table.\u201d |\n| **3. Determination of \u201cmarket rent\u201d** | No formal appraisal is required; the landlord can set any rent that a willing tenant will accept. In practice, landlords look at recent comparable listings on sites like Zillow, Craigslist, or local MLS data. | The rent is fixed at lease signing; there is no later \u201cadjust\u2011to\u2011market\u201d step. |\n| **4. Renewal of rent\u2011control status** | After the first lease term (usually 12\u202fmonths), the unit automatically re\u2011enters the rent\u2011control system. The landlord must file a \u201cRe\u2011registration\u201d or \u201cRent\u2011Stabilization\u201d form indicating the new regulated rent (the market rent just paid). | The next annual increase is limited to the statutory formula (e.g., CPI\u202f+\u202f0.5\u202f%). |\n\n> **Administrative burden:** In large cities the paperwork is handled electronically (e.g., San\u202fFrancisco\u2019s \u201ce\u2011Rent Board\u201d). In smaller municipalities the process can be paper\u2011based, leading to occasional *delays* that affect how quickly a landlord can charge market rent.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Why vacancy\u2011decontrol exists \u2013 the policy rationale  \n\n| Rationale | Explanation |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Prevent \u201cstock\u2011piling\u201d** | Without a decontrol mechanism, landlords could keep a unit occupied indefinitely at a low regulated rent, effectively *locking* a share of the housing stock out of the market. Decontrol lets the market \u201crefresh\u201d rents when turnover occurs. |\n| **Incentivize maintenance & investment**",
