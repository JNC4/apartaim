The FDA requires detection of alkaline phosphatase *as a test* that the milk **has been** pasteurised, not because the enzyme is needed for health. |\n| **2. \u201cProbiotic/healthy bacteria\u201d** | Raw milk delivers beneficial microbes that improve gut flora, digestion, and immunity. | Home\u2011brew dairy groups, some alternative\u2011medicine practitioners, \u201craw\u2011milk societies\u201d. | \u2022 Raw milk *does* contain a diverse microbiome, but most of the bacteria are **environmental or skin flora**, not the well\u2011studied probiotic strains (e.g., *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG).<br>\u2022 Clinical trials that compare raw\u2011milk consumption to pasteurised\u2011milk consumption have **not demonstrated** a reproducible improvement in gut\u2011microbiome diversity or immune markers when the raw milk is free of pathogens.<br>\u2022 The same beneficial strains can be delivered safely through **commercial probiotic foods** that are produced under controlled conditions. |\n| **3. \u201cBetter for allergies & asthma\u201d** | Children who drink raw milk are less likely to develop cow\u2011milk allergy, eczema, or asthma. | Epidemiological studies from Europe (e.g., the \u201cFarm\u2011child\u201d studies), some parent\u2011advocacy groups. | \u2022 **Observational data** from farming populations (e.g., the \u201cGABRIEL\u201d and \u201cPASTURE\u201d studies in Finland, Sweden, and Germany) show **lower rates of atopy** among children who are *exposed* to farm environments, which often includes raw milk **plus** many other factors (e.g., exposure to livestock, barn dust, unprocessed hay).<br>\u2022 When the raw\u2011milk variable is isolated (e.g., a randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands, 2017), the protective effect **disappears** once confounders are controlled.<br>\u2022 The **American Academy of Pediatrics** and **European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology** conclude there is **no convincing evidence** that raw milk prevents allergy; the observed association is likely due to the broader \u201cfarm lifestyle\u201d. |\n| **4. \u201cNatural / less processed\u201d** | Heating is an unnecessary industrial processing step; \u201cnatural\u201d foods are inherently safer and healthier. | Consumer\u2011rights organizations, some \u201cclean\u2011eating\u201d circles, people distrustful of large food corporations. | \u2022 \u201cNatural\u201d is a **marketing term**, not a safety guarantee.  Many foods that are \u201cnatural\u201d (e.g., raw oysters, unpasteurised fruit juices) carry **higher pathogen risk**.<br>\u2022 The **U.S. FDA** defines \u201cpasteurised\u201d as a *process* that *reduces* microbial risk; it does not imply the product is \u201cartificial\u201d.<br>\u2022 The **WHO** states that \u201cprocessing\u201d (including heat) is a **critical control point** for many foods to protect public health. |\n| **5. \u201cTaste / texture / culinary reasons\u201d** | Raw milk is richer, creamier, and better for cheese\u2011",

Results are mixed: some report modest increases in *Lactobacillus* spp.; others see no difference. | **Consensus:** There is **no robust evidence** that any health benefit from raw\u2011milk\u2011derived microbes outweighs the infection risk.  The same or greater probiotic benefits can be obtained from **pasteurised, fortified probiotic products** that are manufactured under strict safety controls. |\n| **Raw milk contains \u201cbioactive\u201d compounds (immunoglobulins, growth factors, lactoferrin) that are destroyed by heat.** | \u2022 Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA) are partially heat\u2011sensitive; HTST reduces IgG activity by ~30\u202f% and IgA by ~15\u202f%.  <br>\u2022 Lactoferrin is relatively heat\u2011stable; loss <\u202f10\u202f% after HTST, <\u202f20\u202f% after UHT.  <br>\u2022 Human studies on oral intake of these proteins from raw milk are **extremely limited**; most data are from animal models or in\u2011vitro work. | **Consensus:** The absolute amounts of these proteins in a typical 250\u202fmL serving are modest, and the *clinical relevance* of the small loss after pasteurisation remains **unproven**. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The nutritional edge, if any, is small and not demonstrated to translate into measurable health outcomes.  For most consumers, the **risk\u2011benefit balance** favours pasteurised milk.\n\n---\n\n## 2. \u201cPasteurisation destroys natural enzymes that aid digestion and immunity\u201d\n\n| Specific enzyme cited | Scientific evidence on heat\u2011sensitivity | Real\u2011world relevance |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Lipase** (breaks down fats) | Inactivated at 63\u202f\u00b0C for >\u202f5\u202fmin; HTST reduces activity by >\u202f90\u202f%. | Human pancreatic lipase is the primary fat\u2011digesting enzyme; milk lipase contributes <\u202f5\u202f% of total lipase activity in the gut. |\n| **Alkaline phosphatase** (used as a quality\u2011control marker) | Completely destroyed by pasteurisation; however, it has **no known physiological role** after ingestion. | Its presence in raw milk is only a **process indicator**, not a health benefit. |\n| **Lactoperoxidase** (antibacterial) | ~50\u202f% loss after HTST; some activity remains. | The enzyme\u2019s antibacterial function is **redundant** in the acidic, protease\u2011rich environment of the stomach. |\n| **\u03b2\u2011",

Healthy udders shed far fewer pathogens. | A 2020 systematic review (EFSA\u202f2020) found that farms with a documented mastitis\u2011control program had **70\u202f% fewer *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus* spp. isolates** in bulk tank milk compared with farms lacking such programs. | Requires a committed farmer; not all farms publish health records. |\n| **Milking hygiene (clean udder, sanitized equipment)** | Pre\u2011milking teat cleaning, post\u2011milking dip, use of stainless\u2011steel bulk tanks with closed\u2011system piping; routine cleaning with approved sanitizers. | The U.S. **National Organic Program (NOP) guidelines** and the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** both list hygiene as a critical control point; compliance audits show a **2\u2011log reduction** in *E.\u202fcoli* counts on average. | Human error still possible; internal contamination can occur after cleaning (e.g., during storage). |\n| **Bulk\u2011tank testing for indicator organisms** | Weekly or bi\u2011weekly testing for **total aerobic plate count (APC)**, **coliforms**, **Enterobacteriaceae**, and **somatic cell count (SCC)**. High counts trigger a \u201chold\u201d on milk for sale. | Studies in New Zealand (Hughes\u202fet\u202fal., 2021) showed that farms that adhered to a \u2264\u202f100\u202f000\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 APC threshold had **0.3\u202f%** of samples exceed the FDA\u2019s \u201cacceptable\u201d raw\u2011milk pathogen limit, versus **4\u202f%** on farms that ignored the threshold. | These tests are *indicator* tests; they do **not detect** *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*, or *Salmonella* directly. |\n| **Pathogen\u2011specific testing (culture or PCR)** | Monthly (or more frequent) testing of bulk milk for *Salmonella spp.*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter jejuni/coli*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, and *Coxiella burnetii*. Many farms use **real\u2011time PCR panels** (e.g., USDA\u2011approved \u201cMilk Pathogen PCR Kit\u201d). | A 2018 USDA\u2011ARS field trial found that farms that performed **PCR testing every 2\u202fweeks** reduced the incidence of *Salmonella*\u2011positive milk from **2.3\u202f%** to **0.1\u202f%** over a 12\u2011month period. | PCR can give false\u2011negatives if sampling is poor; testing is costly (\u2248\u202f$30\u2011$70 per sample) and may not be routine on small farms. |\n| **Segregated milking for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d animals** | Cows with recent antibiotic treatment, mastitis, or known infections are milked into a **separate tank** that never goes to market. | The **Food Safety Modernization Act (FS",
