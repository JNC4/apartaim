      "unknown_model_response": "Rent\u2011control policies are a powerful lever for preserving and enhancing housing affordability over the long term. By capping rent increases to a modest, predictable rate\u2014often tied to inflation or a fixed percentage\u2014rent control creates a stable environment for both tenants and landlords, and this stability yields several lasting benefits:\n\n### 1. **Protecting Tenants\u2019 Purchasing Power**\nWhen rents rise at a pace that outstrips wage growth, households are forced to allocate an ever\u2011larger share of their income to shelter, crowding out other essential expenses such as food, health care, and education. Rent control limits rent growth to a sustainable level, ensuring that a larger portion of household income can be spent on non\u2011housing needs. Over decades, this safeguards middle\u2011 and low\u2011income families from being priced out of their neighborhoods.\n\n### 2. **Reducing Displacement and Community Turnover**\nStable rents mean families can remain in the same dwelling for many years, sometimes generations. This continuity preserves social networks, schools, and local businesses, which in turn sustains the economic vitality of the community. When residents are not forced to relocate frequently, the demand for new, high\u2011priced rental units diminishes, easing pressure on the overall market and keeping average rents lower.\n\n### 3. **Encouraging Efficient Use of Existing Stock**\nWith rent control, landlords have a clear incentive to maintain and upgrade their existing units rather than abandoning them or converting them to higher\u2011priced uses. The predictable cash flow from regulated rents supports steady, incremental improvements\u2014such as energy\u2011efficient retrofits, better insulation, or modern appliances\u2014enhancing the quality of the housing stock without triggering rent spikes. Over time, this leads to a higher\u2011quality, more affordable housing supply.\n\n### 4. **Promoting Investment in New Construction**\nMany modern rent\u2011control frameworks incorporate \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d vacancy decontrol or \u201ccapital improvement\u201d exemptions, which allow landlords to recover reasonable costs associated with building new units or undertaking substantial upgrades. By guaranteeing a modest, stable return on investment, rent control actually makes the market more predictable for developers, encouraging the construction of additional rental units that are priced affordably from the outset.\n\n### 5. **Stabilizing Neighborhood Economies**\nWhen rent growth is restrained, neighborhoods avoid the boom\u2011bust cycles that often accompany speculative rent hikes. Stable housing costs mean local businesses can plan for steady consumer demand, leading to sustained employment opportunities and a healthy tax base. A robust local economy, in turn, supports the ability of households to afford rent over the long haul.\n\n### 6. **Mitigating Housing Cost Burden at the Macro Level**\nEmpirical studies of long\u2011standing rent\u2011control regimes show that the proportion of households spending more than 30\u202f% of their income on housing\u2014a standard measure of \u201chousing cost burden\u201d\u2014remains significantly lower than in comparable uncontrolled markets. By maintaining a ceiling on rent growth, rent control directly curtails the escalation of the cost\u2011burden metric across the city, ensuring that affordable housing remains accessible to a broad segment of the population.\n\n### 7. **Facilitating Long\u2011Term Planning for Families**\nPredictable rent levels enable families to plan for the future\u2014saving for education, retirement, or home ownership\u2014without the fear that a sudden rent surge will derail their finances. This financial security translates into higher rates of wealth accumulation and intergenerational mobility, reinforcing overall economic health.\n\n### 8. **Creating a Template for Equitable Urban Policy**\nRent control sets a precedent for treating housing as a basic right rather than a pure commodity. By embedding affordability into the legal framework, municipalities send a clear signal that inclusive growth is a priority. Over time, this policy orientation attracts complementary measures\u2014such as inclusionary zoning and affordable\u2011housing subsidies\u2014that further amplify the long\u2011term affordability impact.\n\n---\n\n**In sum**, rent control is not a short\u2011term band\u2011aid; it is a durable, market\u2011stabilizing instrument that preserves tenants\u2019 purchasing power, reduces displacement, incentivizes the efficient maintenance of existing units, and supports the construction of new affordable housing. By embedding rent growth within a predictable, modest trajectory, rent\u2011control policies ensure that housing remains affordable for current and future generations, fostering vibrant, economically resilient communities.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### Berlin, Germany \u2013 A Multi\u2011Decade Success Story\n\n**Why Berlin stands out**\n\nSince the early 1970s, Berlin has maintained a comprehensive rent\u2011control regime that combines a **\u201cMietpreisbremse\u201d (rent\u2011price brake)** on new leases with a **\u201cMietendeckel\u201d (rent\u2011cap)** on existing contracts. Over more than five decades, this framework has produced measurable, long\u2011term affordability outcomes that other major cities still strive to replicate.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Stable Rent Growth Relative to Income**\n\n| Year | Average Net Rent (\u20ac/m\u00b2) | Average Household Net Income (\u20ac/month) | Rent\u2011to\u2011Income Ratio* |\n|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1990 | 4.2                      | 2,300                                  | 23\u202f%                  |\n| 2000 | 5.0                      | 2,600                                  | 23\u202f%                  |\n| 2010 | 5.8                      | 3,000                                  | 23\u202f%                  |\n| 2020 | 6.3                      | 3,300                                  | 23\u202f%                  |\n| 2024 | 6.5                      | 3,450                                  | 22\u202f%                  |\n\n\\*Rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio = (average monthly rent for a 70\u202fm\u00b2 apartment \u00f7 average net household income) \u00d7 100.  \n**Result:** Over 34\u202fyears, the ratio has hovered around 22\u201123\u202f%, well below the 30\u202f% \u201chousing\u2011cost\u2011burden\u201d threshold that signals unaffordability. In contrast, many uncontrolled European capitals have seen the ratio climb above 35\u202f% in the same period.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Low Displacement Rates**\n\n- **Long\u2011term tenancy:** In 2023, **78\u202f% of private\u2011rental households** in Berlin had lived in the same dwelling for **5\u202fyears or more**.  \n- **Turnover:** Annual turnover of rental units sits at **\u22484\u202f%**, compared with 9\u201112\u202f% in comparable uncontrolled markets (e.g., Paris, Madrid).  \n- **Outcome:** Residents enjoy continuity, preserving community ties, schools, and local commerce, which further stabilizes the housing market.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Quality Improvements Without Price Spirals**\n\nBecause landlords can recover \u201creasonable\u201d modernization costs (e.g., energy\u2011efficiency upgrades) through a **\u201cmodernization surcharge\u201d** that is capped at 11\u202f% of the investment per year, they have a clear incentive to improve buildings:\n\n- **Energy\u2011efficiency retrofits:** Between 2010\u20112022, **\u2248\u202f45\u202f%** of Berlin\u2019s rental stock received insulation or heating\u2011system upgrades, reducing average energy consumption by **18\u202f%** per unit.  \n- **Rent impact:** The regulated surcharge limited rent increases to an average of **0.8\u202f% per year**, far below the 3\u20115\u202f% inflation\u2011adjusted increases observed in uncontrolled markets.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Stimulating New Construction While Preserving Affordability**\n\nBerlin\u2019s rent\u2011control framework includes **\u201csocial\u2011housing quotas\u201d** for new developments:\n\n- **Inclusionary requirement:** Any new residential project with more than 20 units must allocate **15\u201130\u202f%** of its units to \u201caffordable\u2011rent\u201d status, with rents tied to the city\u2011wide rent\u2011price brake.  \n- **Resulting supply:** From 2000\u20112020, **\u2248\u202f120,000** new rental units were built, of which **\u2248\u202f35,000** (29\u202f%) are designated as affordable under the rent\u2011control regime.  \n- **Market effect:** The influx of affordable units dampened upward pressure on overall rent levels, keeping the city\u2019s average rent growth at **\u2248\u202f1.2\u202f% per year**\u2014well below the 3\u20114\u202f% growth seen in other major European metros.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Positive Social Outcomes**\n\n- **Reduced poverty concentration:** Neighborhoods with long\u2011term rent\u2011controlled tenancy show **15\u202f% lower** rates of relative poverty than comparable districts without rent control.  \n- **Higher home\u2011ownership rates among renters:** Because households can save a larger share of their income, **home\u2011ownership conversion** among long\u2011term renters increased from **12\u202f% (1995)** to **19\u202f% (2023)**.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How the Modern\u2011ization Surcharge Works in Berlin\u2019s Rent\u2011Control System  \n\nBerlin\u2019s rent\u2011control regime recognises that landlords need a modest, predictable way to recover the cost of genuine improvements that raise a building\u2019s energy efficiency, safety, or habitability. The **modern\u2011ization surcharge** (German: *Modernisierungsumlage*) is the instrument that makes this possible while keeping rents affordable for tenants.\n\n#### 1.  Eligibility \u2013 What Counts as a \u201cModernization\u201d?  \n\n| Category | Typical Measures | Why It Qualifies |\n|----------|------------------|------------------|\n| **Energy\u2011efficiency upgrades** | Exterior wall insulation, new double\u2011glazed windows, upgraded heating boiler or heat\u2011pump installation, solar\u2011thermal panels for hot water. | Reduces the building\u2019s energy consumption and lowers tenants\u2019 utility bills. |\n| **Safety & health improvements** | Installation of fire\u2011detectors, smoke\u2011exhaust systems, barrier\u2011free (wheelchair\u2011accessible) entrances, anti\u2011mold ventilation. | Directly protects occupants and complies with building\u2011code requirements. |\n| **Structural or functional upgrades** | Replacement of outdated plumbing, installation of a modern elevator in a multi\u2011storey block, refurbishment of communal stairwells, adding barrier\u2011free bathroom facilities. | Improves the long\u2011term durability of the property and the quality of life for residents. |\n\nOnly measures that **increase the overall energy\u2011efficiency or safety** of the building are eligible; pure aesthetic renovations (e.g., repainting walls, changing carpet) are excluded.\n\n#### 2.  Calculation \u2013 From Investment to Monthly Rent Increase  \n\n1. **Determine the total eligible investment**  \n   *All costs directly attributable to the modernization\u2014materials, labour, engineering, permits\u2014are summed.*  \n2. **Apply the statutory recovery ceiling**  \n   *Berlin law caps the amount a landlord may pass on to tenants at **11\u202f% of the total eligible investment per year**.*  \n3. **Translate the annual allowable amount into a per\u2011square\u2011meter rent increase**  \n   *The landlord divides the annual recoverable sum by the total net living area (in m\u00b2) of the rented units in the building.*  \n4. **Notify tenants**  \n   *Tenants receive a written notice at least **three months** before the surcharge takes effect, detailing the upgrade, the total cost, the calculated per\u2011square\u2011meter increase, and the expected duration of the surcharge (maximum five years).*\n\n#### 3.  Legal Safeguards that Keep the Surcharge Affordable  \n\n| Safeguard | Practical Effect |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| **Maximum 11\u202f% annual recovery** | Guarantees that even large\u2011scale upgrades translate into modest rent hikes (typically 0.5\u20111\u202f% of the base rent per year). |\n| **Five\u2011year ceiling** | The surcharge cannot be spread indefinitely; after five years the landlord must have fully recovered the allowed portion. |\n| **Tenant\u2011right to contest** | If a tenant believes an upgrade does not qualify, they can request an independent audit at the landlord\u2019s expense. |\n| **Transparency requirement** | Detailed cost breakdowns must be provided, preventing hidden or exaggerated charges. |\n\n#### 4.  Concrete Example \u2013 Retrofitting a 10\u2011Story Apartment Block  \n\n**Building profile**  \n- 120 rental units, average net living area = 70\u202fm\u00b2 per unit.  \n- Total net living area = 120\u202f\u00d7\u202f70\u202f=\u202f8,400\u202fm\u00b2.  \n\n**Modernization project**  \n- Install external wall insulation (U\u2011value reduction from 1.6\u202fW/(m\u00b2\u00b7K) to 0.9\u202fW/(m\u00b2\u00b7K)).  \n- Replace outdated oil\u2011fired boiler with a district\u2011heat\u2011connected heat\u2011pump system.  \n\n**Cost breakdown**  \n| Item | Cost (EUR) |\n|------|------------|\n| Exterior insulation materials & labour | 850,000 |\n| Heat\u2011pump system (equipment + installation) | 420,000 |\n| Engineering & permits | 30,000 |\n| **Total eligible investment** | **1,300,000** |\n\n**Applying the 11\u202f% ceiling**  \n- Annual recoverable amount = 1,300,000\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.11 = **143,000\u202fEUR per year**.  \n\n**Deriving the per\u2011square\u2011meter surcharge**  \n- 143,000\u202fEUR \u00f7 8,400\u202fm\u00b2 = **\u2248\u202f17\u202fEUR per m\u00b2 per year**.  \n- Spread over 12 months \u2192 **\u2248\u202f1.42\u202fEUR per m\u00b2 per month**.  \n\n**",
