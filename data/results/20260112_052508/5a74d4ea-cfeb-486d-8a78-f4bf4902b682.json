      "unknown_model_response": "**Why doctors recommend childhood vaccinations \u2013 the key reasons**\n\n| Reason | What it means for the child (and the community) | Typical evidence that supports it |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Prevention of serious disease** | Vaccines protect children from infections that can cause severe illness, permanent disability, or death (e.g., measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis). | \u2022 Randomized\u2011controlled trials (RCTs) and large observational studies show >90\u202f% reduction in disease incidence after vaccine introduction (e.g., measles\u2011containing vaccine reduced global measles deaths by ~73\u202f% from 2000\u20112018 \u2013 WHO). |\n| **Herd (community) immunity** | When enough people are immune, transmission chains are broken, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated (infants too young for certain shots, immunocompromised patients). | \u2022 Modeling studies estimate that >90\u202f% coverage for measles is needed to maintain herd immunity; many countries achieve this through routine schedules, keeping outbreaks rare. |\n| **Economic and social benefits** | Fewer doctor visits, hospitalizations, and long\u2011term health costs; children miss fewer school days; families avoid caregiving burdens. | \u2022 A 2018 cost\u2011effectiveness analysis (JAMA Network Open) found that the routine U.S. childhood vaccine schedule saves >$13\u202fbillion annually in direct medical costs and >$50\u202fbillion in societal costs. |\n| **Predictable and controlled exposure** | Natural infection can be unpredictable and often more severe than vaccine\u2011induced immunity. | \u2022 For example, natural varicella (chickenpox) leads to hospitalization in ~1 per 1,000 cases and can cause encephalitis, whereas the varicella vaccine prevents >95\u202f% of severe disease. |\n| **International travel and school requirements** | Many schools, day\u2011cares, and travel destinations require proof of vaccination to limit the spread of preventable diseases. | \u2022 Legal and public\u2011health policies are based on data that high coverage reduces outbreaks (e.g., no measles cases in the U.S. from 2000\u20112008 after high MMR uptake). |\n| **Long\u2011term health protection** | Some vaccine\u2011preventable diseases have sequelae that appear years later (e.g., HPV \u2192 cervical cancer; HBV \u2192 liver cirrhosis). | \u2022 Long\u2011term cohort studies show a >90\u202f% drop in cervical cancer incidence in countries with high HPV\u2011vaccine coverage (e.g., Australia). |\n\n**How safe are childhood vaccines?**\n\n1. **Regulatory oversight and manufacturing standards**  \n   * In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires three phases of clinical testing (Phase\u202fI\u2011III) before a vaccine is licensed.  \n   * The European Medicines Agency (EMA), WHO pre\u2011qualification, and analogous agencies in other regions follow comparable rigorous pathways.  \n   * After licensure, vaccines are subject to post\u2011marketing surveillance (e.g., VAERS, VSD in the U.S.; EudraVigilance in the EU) that monitors millions of doses for rare events.\n\n2. **Common, mild side\u2011effects** (occurring in >1\u202f% of recipients)  \n   * **Local reactions:** pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.  \n   * **Systemic reactions:** low\u2011grade fever, irritability, fatigue, or mild rash.  \n   * These typically resolve within 1\u20133\u202fdays and are signs that the immune system is responding.\n\n3. **Serious adverse events (SAEs)**  \n   * **Incidence:** SAEs are **extremely rare**, usually <1 per 100,000 doses for most childhood vaccines.  \n   * **Examples & data:**  \n     * **Anaphylaxis:** \u22481\u20132 cases per million doses of most vaccines (CDC\u2019s v-safe data, 2022). Prompt treatment with epinephrine is standard and outcomes are excellent.  \n     * **Febrile seizures** after the combined measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MM",
