Real\u2011world values are usually lower because the beam is directed horizontally and many of the radiated waves are absorbed or reflected by buildings, foliage, and the ground.\n\n### What the numbers mean in practice\n\n| Situation | Typical exposure (average) | How it feels |\n|-----------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| Standing 30\u202fm from a 5G macro\u2011cell tower | \u2248\u202f0.2\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2 (well below natural background RF of \u2248\u202f0.1\u202f\u2013\u202f0.2\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2) | No perceptible sensation; exposure is orders of magnitude lower than everyday radio, TV, and Wi\u2011Fi signals. |\n| Walking past a 5G small cell on a street | \u2248\u202f3\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2 at 5\u202fm distance | Still far below the International Commission on Non\u2011Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) general public limit of 10\u202f\u00b5W/cm\u00b2 for frequencies used by 5G (\u223c\u202f3.5\u202fGHz). |\n| Holding a smartphone to your ear during a call | SAR \u2248\u202f0.8\u202fW/kg (typical modern phone) | The phone\u2019s antenna is only a few centimeters from the head, so the *local* field is much higher than what you get from a tower, but the overall energy absorbed stays within regulatory safety limits. |\n\n### Key take\u2011aways\n\n1. **Distance matters enormously.** Power density falls with the square of the distance. A tower that radiates 50\u202fW spreads that energy over a sphere many meters in radius; by the time it reaches a person standing a few dozen meters away, the intensity is minuscule.\n\n2. **Regulatory limits are conservative.** The ICNIRP and national agencies set exposure limits that are **10\u2011 to 100\u2011times lower** than the levels at which any proven thermal (heating) effect occurs. Both typical tower\u2011site fields and typical smartphone SAR values sit comfortably below those limits.\n\n3. **Smartphones deliver the highest localized exposure.** Because a phone\u2019s antenna is right next to the head, the *specific absorption rate* (SAR) is the metric used to",
      "truthbot_response": "Below is a **step\u2011by\u2011step, numbers\u2011driven illustration** of the difference between the radio\u2011frequency (RF) field that a person receives from a typical 5\u2011G cellular\u2011site antenna and the field from a smartphone that is held next to the head.  \nThe calculation uses values that are published by regulators, industry measurement campaigns, and peer\u2011reviewed studies.  All numbers are **order\u2011of\u2011magnitude estimates** (the exact figure will vary with antenna height, terrain, traffic load, device model, etc.), but they capture the size of the gap that most experts point to when they say that \u201ctower exposure is tiny compared with phone exposure\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
