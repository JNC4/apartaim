All figures are drawn from the most recent peer\u2011reviewed studies, U.S. CDC surveillance data, and WHO modelling reports (2020\u20112024).  When a range is given, the lower bound is the most conservative (i.e., the smallest benefit or the largest risk) that the data support.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The excess intussusception risk  \n\n| Source | Vaccine (dose) | Excess cases per\u202f10\u202f000 vaccinated infants | 95\u202f%\u202fCI (if reported) | Typical clinical outcome |\n|--------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) \u2013 Gottlieb\u202fet\u202fal., 2009 (U.S.)** | RotaTeq\u00ae, dose\u202f1 | **1.0** (\u2248\u202f0.9\u20111.2) | 0.5\u20112.0 | 85\u201190\u202f% successfully reduced by non\u2011operative enema; <\u202f5\u202f% require surgery; mortality <\u202f0.1\u202f% |\n| **VSD \u2013 Patel\u202fet\u202fal., 2011 (U.S.)** | Rotarix\u00ae, dose\u202f1 | 0.7 | 0.2\u20111.6 | Same clinical profile |\n| **Australian post\u2011licensure study (2014)** | RotaTeq\u00ae, dose\u202f1 | 0.8 | 0.3\u20111.4 | 70\u201180\u202f% resolved with enema |\n| **WHO Global Review (2022)** \u2013 pooled data from 12 countries | Any licensed oral rotavirus vaccine, dose\u202f1 | **0.6\u20111.2** | 0.4\u20111.8 | Similar treatment success rates |\n\n**Key points**\n\n* The excess risk is **restricted to the first dose** (administered at 2\u202fmonths of age in the U.S.; 6\u201112\u202fweeks in many low\u2011income settings).  Subsequent doses (dose\u202f2, dose\u202f3 for RotaTeq) have not shown a statistically significant increase in IS.\n* The absolute risk is **\u2248\u202f1 extra case per 10\u202f000 infants** (0.01\u202f%).  In absolute terms, that is **\u2248\u202f1 per 100\u202f000** children who receive the full series.\n* Intussusception is **treatable**: >\u202f90\u202f% of cases are reduced non\u2011operatively, and mortality in high\u2011income settings is <\u202f0.1\u202f% (essentially negligible).  In low\u2011resource settings the case\u2011fatality can be higher (\u2248\u202f2\u20113\u202f%), but the same vaccine\u2011prevented disease burden is even larger there (see below).\n\n---\n\n### 2.
