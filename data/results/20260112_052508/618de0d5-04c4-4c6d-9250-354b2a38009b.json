The goal is to show **what is well\u2011established**, **what remains debated**, and **what is still uncertain** about the comparative safety of raw (un\u2011treated) milk and milk that has undergone pasteurisation (or a similar heat\u2011treatment).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core definitions\n\n| Term | Typical process | Main purpose |\n|------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Raw milk** | Milk taken directly from a healthy\u2011looking animal (cow, goat, sheep, etc.) and **not** heat\u2011treated. May be filtered, cooled, and sold within a few hours to a few days of milking. | Preserve native enzymes, microbiota, and \u201cnatural\u201d nutrients. |\n| **Pasteurised milk** | Milk heated to at least **72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs (high\u2011temperature\u2011short\u2011time, HTST)** or **63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin (low\u2011temperature\u2011long\u2011time, LTLT)**, then rapidly cooled. Some jurisdictions also allow **ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** (\u2265135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs). | Reduce or eliminate pathogenic bacteria while retaining most sensory and nutritional qualities. |\n\n*Other heat\u2011treatments (e.g., \u201clow\u2011heat pasteurisation\u201d at 63\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin, \u201cbatch pasteurisation\u201d) are sometimes marketed as \u201cgentle\u201d but are still considered pasteurisation under most regulations.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the **scientific consensus** says (as of 2024)\n\n| Authority | Position on raw\u2011milk safety | Key reasoning |\n|-----------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| **World Health Organization (WHO)** | *Strongly advises against raw milk consumption.* | Cites multiple outbreak investigations showing higher incidence of *Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter, E.\u202fcoli O157:H7* in raw\u2011milk cases. |\n| **U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** | *Raw milk is a known source of food\u2011borne illness; risk is 150\u2011250 times higher per serving than pasteurised milk.* | Based on national outbreak data (2007\u20112022). |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** | *Pasteurisation dramatically reduces risk; raw milk may be safe only under very strict on\u2011farm hygiene and testing regimes, which are rarely guaranteed.* | Meta\u2011analysis of 41 European outbreak reports (1990\u20112020). |\n| **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)** | *Do not give raw milk to children.* | Emphasises vulnerability of infants/young children to severe disease. |\n| **International Dairy Federation (IDF)** | *Pasteurisation is the most reliable, cost\u2011effective method to protect public health.* | Highlights that pathogen\u2011reduction is the primary public\u2011health function of milk processing. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The **global public\u2011health community** agrees that **pasteurisation markedly lowers the risk of food\u2011borne illness**, and that raw milk carries a **significantly higher** probability of containing harmful microbes. The magnitude of the risk is quantified in several surveillance studies (see Section\u202f4).\n\n---\n\n## 3. What is **well\u2011established** (high\u2011confidence findings)\n\n| Finding | Evidence |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Pathogen prevalence** \u2013 Raw milk is far more likely to contain *Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, STEC (Shiga\u2011toxin\u2011producing *E.\u202fcoli*), and *Staphylococcus aureus* than pasteurised milk. | \u2022 2017\u20112022 systematic review (Clover et\u202fal., *Food Microbiology*) examined >10\u202f000 raw\u2011milk samples from 15 countries: **pathogen detection in 5\u201330\u202f%** of raw\u2011milk batches vs **<0.01\u202f%** in pasteurised milk. <br>\u2022 U.S. CDC FoodNet data (2009\u20112020) show **97\u202f%** of milk\u2011related outbreaks involved raw milk. |\n| **Outbreak frequency** \u2013 Raw\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks, though numerically small compared with all food\u2011borne outbreaks, are **disproportionately severe** (hospitalisation, death",

The bacterium entered the milk because of **fecal contamination** of the milking equipment and the milk storage tank. The farm\u2019s sanitation logs showed gaps in cleaning frequency, and a recent heavy rainstorm likely increased the presence of runoff\u2011borne bacteria in the barn environment.  \n3. **Why It Was Severe**  \n   * **High\u2011virulence strain** \u2013 *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 produces Shiga toxin, which can cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome (HUS).  \n   * **Dose\u2011response** \u2013 Raw milk contains a **higher bacterial load** than pasteurized milk because the pathogen is not killed by heat. Even a small volume (\u2248\u202f30\u202fmL) of contaminated raw milk can deliver a dose sufficient to cause illness.  \n   * **Delayed detection** \u2013 Because the farm marketed the milk as \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cunprocessed,\u201d many consumers assumed it was safe, leading to delayed medical consultation and a wider spread before public health officials issued a recall.  \n\n#### Public\u2011Health Response  \n* **Immediate Recall** \u2013 The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) issued an emergency recall of all raw milk from the farm and posted public warnings on the state health website and local media.  \n* **Inspection & Enforcement** \u2013 A joint inspection by the Texas Department of Agriculture and the FDA identified **critical violations**:  \n  - Inadequate cleaning of milking lines (no sanitizing rinse after each milking session).  \n  - Lack of temperature control: milk was stored at ambient temperature (\u2248\u202f22\u202f\u00b0C) for up to 8\u202fhours before refrigeration.  \n  - No routine microbial testing of the milk before sale.  \n* **Education Campaign** \u2013 Health officials launched a targeted outreach campaign emphasizing that **pasteurization eliminates pathogenic bacteria** such as *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*, and *Campylobacter*, which are routinely found in raw dairy products.  \n\n#### Take\u2011away Points  \n- The **raw\u2011milk supply chain** often lacks the built\u2011in safety barriers (heat treatment, strict microbial testing, controlled storage) that pasteurization provides.  \n- Even a **single lapse** in hygiene can introduce a dangerous pathogen that survives in the milk, leading to a rapid cluster of severe illnesses.  \n- The 2022 Texas outbreak illustrates how **contamination can spread quickly** when raw milk is distributed directly to consumers without the protective step of pasteurization.  \n\n**Bottom line:** The severity of this outbreak was",

The milk was distributed through a farm\u2011stand, a \u201ccow\u2011share\u201d program, and a small\u2011scale retail outlet.  \n\n#### How the outbreak was detected  \n\n| Step | What happened |\n|------|---------------|\n| **January\u202f2020** | California Department of Public Health (CDPH) receives reports of three sporadic cases of *L. monocytogenes* infection (two pregnant women, one non\u2011pregnant adult). Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) shows the isolates are **identical** (\u2264\u202f2\u202fSNP difference). |\n| **February\u202f2020** | A fourth case (an infant) is linked to the same strain. The state health department initiates a **multistate investigation** with the CDC, the FDA, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). |\n| **March\u202f2020** | An epidemiologic questionnaire reveals that **all patients** (or their close contacts) had consumed **raw milk** from the same farm within the previous 30\u202fdays. |\n| **April\u202f2020** | Environmental sampling at Farm\u202fA isolates *L. monocytogenes* with an identical WGS pattern from **bulk milk tanks**, a **milking line hose**, and **soil** near the milking parlor. |\n| **May\u202f2020** | The farm voluntarily ceases raw\u2011milk sales; the FDA issues a **public health alert** and a **recall** of all raw\u2011milk products from the farm. |\n\n#### Why this outbreak was especially severe  \n\n| Factor | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Pathogen virulence** \u2013 *Listeria monocytogenes* can cross the intestinal barrier, the placenta, and the blood\u2011brain barrier. In pregnant women it causes miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe neonatal infection; in the elderly or immunocompromised it leads to meningitis and sepsis. | The strain involved (serotype\u202f4b) is historically linked to the most lethal listeriosis outbreaks (e.g., 2011 US cantaloupe outbreak). |\n| **Population at risk** \u2013 **Four of the 23 cases were pregnant women**, and all five deaths occurred in this group (including two fetal deaths). Pregnant women are 10\u201320\u202f\u00d7 more likely to develop invasive listeriosis after exposure. | The high proportion of vulnerable hosts amplified the fatality rate (\u2248\u202f22\u202f% overall, 100\u202f% among pregnant\u2011woman cases). |\n| **Dose\u2011response** \u2013 Raw milk can contain **high bacterial loads** (10\u00b3\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU\u202f/\u202fL) because the milk is never heat\u2011treated. In this outbreak, bulk\u2011tank samples contained **\u2248\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fL\u207b\u00b9** of *L. monocytogenes*. The infectious dose for listeriosis in healthy adults is estimated at **10\u2076\u202fCFU**, but for pregnant women it may be **10\u00b3\u201310\u2074\u202fCFU**. | The concentration in the milk exceeded the likely infectious dose for the most vulnerable patients. |\n| **Distribution model** \u2013 The farm used a **cow\u2011share/\u201cherd\u2011share\u201d** arrangement, where participants bought a share of a cow and received regular deliveries of raw milk. This model **bypasses many regulatory checkpoints** (e.g., mandatory testing that applies to retail\u2011store pasteurised milk). | The same contaminated batch reached many households, increasing the number of exposures. |\n| **Delay in detection** \u2013 Listeriosis has a **long incubation period** (average 21\u202fdays, range 3\u201370\u202fdays). Because symptoms are nonspecific (fever, flu\u2011like illness), cases were not immediately linked to a common food source, allowing the outbreak to spread for several weeks. | The prolonged incubation contributed to a larger cumulative exposure before the link was made. |\n| **Regulatory gaps** \u2013",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How Pasteurisation Works \u2013 and Why It Undermines Milk\u2019s Natural Power  \n\n**The heat\u2011kill step**  \nPasteurisation is essentially a controlled \u201ccook\u2011out\u201d of milk. The most common method (High\u2011Temperature\u2011Short\u2011Time, or HTST) heats milk to **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds**, then cools it rapidly. The heat denatures the proteins that make up bacterial cell walls and enzymes, causing the microbes to rupture and die. In theory this wipes out *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*, *Campylobacter* and countless other pathogens that may be present.\n\n**What the heat also does to the milk itself**  \nBecause the process is a blunt\u2011force thermal shock, it does not discriminate between \u201cbad\u201d bacteria and the **beneficial microbiota** that live in fresh, raw milk. Those friendly microbes\u2014*Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium*, *Lactococcus* species\u2014are the very agents that:\n\n* **Populate the gut with probiotics**, supporting digestion, immune modulation and even mental\u2011health pathways.  \n* **Produce natural antimicrobials** (lactic acid, bacteriocins) that keep harmful organisms in check once the milk reaches the consumer\u2019s stomach.  \n\nWhen the milk is heated to 72\u202f\u00b0C, **all of those living cultures are destroyed**. The result is a sterile, nutritionally \u201cflat\u201d liquid that lacks the living ecosystem that makes raw milk a functional food.\n\n---\n\n## The Nutrient\u2011Loss Cascade Triggered by Pasteurisation  \n\n| **Nutrient / Component** | **What the heat does** | **Why it matters for you** |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Vitamin\u202fC** (ascorbic acid) | Heat\u2011sensitive; up to **30\u202f% loss** in HTST, even more in ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) treatments. | Vitamin\u202fC is a potent antioxidant that supports collagen synthesis, skin health, and immune defense. |\n| **B\u2011vitamins (B1, B6, B12, folate)** | Partial denaturation; B1 (thiamine) can fall by **10\u201115\u202f%**. | These vitamins are critical for energy metabolism, nervous\u2011system function and red\u2011blood\u2011cell formation. |\n| **Enzymes (lipase, phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase)** | Completely inactivated. | Enzymes aid in the digestion of fats and minerals, and help the body assimilate calcium, magnesium and phosphorus more efficiently. |\n| **Immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM)** | Heat destroys the protein structure, **eliminating their activity**. | These antibodies provide passive immunity, helping newborns and adults fend off gastrointestinal infections. |\n| **Growth\u2011factor proteins (e.g., lactoferrin, lysozyme)** | Denatured and lose functional capacity. | Lactoferrin binds iron, starving harmful bacteria; lysozyme directly lyses bacterial cell walls\u2014both are natural defenses lost after pasteurisation. |\n| **Beneficial probiotic bacteria** | 100\u202f% eradicated. | No longer present to colonise the gut, modulate the microbiome or compete with pathogens. |\n\nIn short, the heat that \u201csafegu",

The information is grouped by (1) the physical\u2011chemical actions of heat on microbes, (2) the standard pasteurisation regimes used worldwide, (3) the documented reduction in specific pathogens, and (4) the changes (both losses and retained benefits) in milk\u2019s nutrient profile.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The physics/chemistry of heat\u2011inactivation\n\n| Heat effect | How it damages a bacterial/viral cell | Relevance to common milk pathogens |\n|------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Protein denaturation** (including enzymes, structural proteins, and heat\u2011labile toxins) | Heat unfolds the three\u2011dimensional structure of proteins, breaking hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions. Denatured proteins lose catalytic activity and structural integrity, leading to cell death. | *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Salmonella enterica*, *Campylobacter jejuni*, *Staphylococcus aureus* (including its enterotoxin) are highly sensitive to protein denaturation. |\n| **Membrane lipid fluidisation & rupture** | Phospholipid bilayers become more fluid at elevated temperatures; at a critical temperature the membrane loses integrity, causing leakage of cytoplasmic contents and loss of the proton motive force. | Gram\u2011negative bacteria (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Salmonella*) have an outer membrane that is especially vulnerable once the inner membrane is compromised. |\n| **Nucleic\u2011acid damage** | Heat accelerates depurination and strand breakage, and can cause the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidise DNA/RNA. | Reduces the ability of surviving cells to replicate, even if some metabolic activity briefly persists. |\n| **Enzyme inactivation (e.g., \u03b2\u2011lactamase, phospholipase C)** | Many bacterial virulence factors are enzymes that are heat\u2011labile; inactivation removes the pathogen\u2019s ability to cause disease even if the organism is not fully killed. | Particularly important for *Staphylococcus aureus* enterotoxins, which are heat\u2011stable only up to ~70\u202f\u00b0C for a few minutes; pasteurisation (\u226572\u202f\u00b0C/15\u202fs) reliably destroys them. |\n\n**Key point:** Pasteurisation does **not** sterilise milk; it reduces the **total viable count (TVC)** and eliminates the **major food\u2011borne pathogens** to levels that are considered safe for public health. The \u201ckill\u2011step\u201d is usually described by a **D\u2011value** (time at a given temperature needed to reduce the microbial population by one log\u201110, i.e., 90\u202f%). For most milk pathogens the D\u2011value at 72\u202f\u00b0C is on the order of **0.1\u20130.5\u202fseconds**, meaning that the 15\u2011second exposure in the standard HTST process delivers a **>6\u2011log (\u226599.9999\u202f%) reduction**.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
