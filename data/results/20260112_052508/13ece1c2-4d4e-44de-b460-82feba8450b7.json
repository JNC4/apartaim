      "unknown_model_response": "**How a gun\u2011buyback program works**\n\n| Step | What usually happens | Typical variations |\n|------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| **1. Sponsorship & funding** | A government agency, police department, or nonprofit raises money (often from the budget, grants, or private donors). | Some programs are fully government\u2011funded (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 buy\u2011back); others are \u201ccommunity\u2011run\u201d and rely on corporate or charitable donations. |\n| **2. Public announcement** | Dates, locations, and the incentive (cash, vouchers, gift cards, or a \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d token) are advertised. | Incentives range from $50\u202f\u2013\u202f$500 per firearm; some cities offer higher amounts for \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d weapons (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles). |\n| **3. Voluntary surrender** | Anyone can bring a firearm (and sometimes ammunition) to a designated site, hand it over, and receive the incentive. | Most U.S. programs are **anonymous** \u2013 no identification is required, which encourages participation but prevents tracking of who turned in guns. |\n| **4. Turn\u2011in process** | Firearms are inspected, catalogued, and then either destroyed, sold to a licensed dealer, or (rarely) transferred to a museum. | In Australia and New\u202fZealand the guns were **destroyed**; in some U.S. cities they are auctioned and the proceeds go back to the community. |\n| **5. Follow\u2011up** | Data on the number, type, and condition of guns collected are compiled for evaluation. | A few programs pair the buy\u2011back with safe\u2011storage workshops, counseling, or referrals to mental\u2011health services. |\n\nKey features that differ across programs  \n\n* **Mandatory vs. voluntary** \u2013 Most U.S. buy\u2011backs are voluntary; Australia\u2019s 1996 scheme was mandatory (owners were legally required to register and then surrender their weapons for a set price).  \n* **Scope** \u2013 Some target all firearms; others focus on specific categories (handguns, assault\u2011style rifles, or \u201cghost guns\u201d).  \n* **Frequency** \u2013 One\u2011off events (often a weekend) are common, but some jurisdictions hold recurring quarterly or annual buy\u2011backs.  \n* **Legal protections** \u2013 In the U.S., the\u202fGun\u2011Free School Zones Act and state \u201cimmunity\u201d statutes often protect participants from prosecution for previously illegal possession when they surrender the gun in good\u2011faith.\n\n---\n\n**What the evidence says about violence outcomes**\n\nThe research base is modest, heterogeneous, and sometimes contradictory. Below is a synthesis of the most frequently cited studies and systematic reviews, grouped by the type of outcome that researchers have measured.\n\n| Outcome | What the data show | Representative studies / reviews |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Overall homicide/violent crime** | **Little or no measurable reduction** in most U.S. city buy\u2011backs; modest declines in a",

What a \u201cgun\u2011buyback\u201d actually is**\n\n| Element | Typical practice | Common variations |\n|---------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **Who runs it?** | Local police departments, city governments, or non\u2011profit coalitions (often with the backing of a state or national agency). | Some are run by national police forces (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 national buy\u2011back) or by community\u2011based NGOs. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | Residents bring firearms to a designated location (often a police station or community center) during a limited\u2011time \u201cevent.\u201d | Mobile vans, door\u2011to\u2011door collection, or mail\u2011in programs are occasionally used. |\n| **What do participants receive?** | Cash, gift cards, vouchers, or other incentives (usually $50\u2011$200 per gun). | In a few programs the incentive is a \u201cdonation\u201d receipt for tax purposes; in others the value is tiered by gun type. |\n| **Is participation mandatory?** | **No.** Participation is voluntary; the program relies on people choosing to turn in guns they already own. | Some countries (e.g., Australia, New\u202fZealand after 2019) combined a *mandatory* registration/turn\u2011in with a one\u2011time cash incentive, but the \u201cbuy\u2011back\u201d component is still voluntary. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Turned over to the police, then typically destroyed (shredding, melting) or, in rare cases, sold to collectors after de\u2011activation. | A few jurisdictions keep a small number for law\u2011enforcement training or museum display. |\n| **Targeted firearms** | All legal firearms, sometimes limited to handguns or \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d rifles, depending on local law. | Some programs restrict to handguns; others accept any firearm, ammunition, or accessories. |\n\nThe **core idea** is simple: give people a low\u2011cost, low\u2011risk way to remove a gun from their home (or the street) and thereby *reduce the pool of firearms that could be used in a homicide, suicide, or accidental shooting.*  \n\n---\n\n## 2. The empirical question: Do gun\u2011buybacks lower gun\u2011related violence?\n\n### 2.1  Summary of the overall scientific consensus\n\n> **Consensus (as of 2024):** The preponderance of peer\u2011reviewed research finds **little to no measurable impact of voluntary gun\u2011buyback programs on overall rates of homicide, assault, or overall gun crime**.  \n> \n> The evidence is stronger (though still limited) for modest short\u2011term reductions in **suicide** and **accidental shootings**, especially when buy\u2011backs are paired with other interventions (e.g., public\u2011awareness campaigns, safe\u2011storage laws).  \n> \n> Major public\u2011health bodies (CDC, WHO, the American Public Health Association) therefore list gun\u2011buybacks as a **\u201clow\u2011certainty, low\u2011impact\u201d** strategy: they may be useful",
