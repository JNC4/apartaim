      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a short reminder**  \nWhen a central bank \u201cpurchases securities\u201d (usually government bonds, sometimes corporate bonds or mortgage\u2011backed securities) it injects new reserves into the banking system.  The goal is to lower longer\u2011term interest rates, improve the functioning of credit markets, and stimulate aggregate demand when conventional policy (short\u2011term rate cuts) is already exhausted.\n\nBecause QE works mainly through the *financial* side of the economy, its effects are felt unevenly across households, firms and investors.  Below is a synthesis of the main channels that scholars, policymakers and market participants have identified, together with the points on which the evidence is still mixed.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Households  \n\n| Channel | Typical impact | Who benefits / who may lose | Evidence & caveats |\n|---------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Lower borrowing costs** (mortgages, auto loans, credit\u2011cards) | Reduces monthly payments, can raise disposable income and home\u2011ownership rates. | Borrowers \u2013 especially new home\u2011buyers and those with variable\u2011rate debt. | Studies of the U.S. QE (2008\u20112014) find mortgage\u2011rate cuts of 30\u201150\u202fbps, which raise house\u2011purchase volumes modestly (e.g., *R. Gagnon et\u202fal., 2015*). The effect is weaker when credit standards are tight. |\n| **Higher asset prices** (equities, housing, bonds) | Increases the net worth of owners of those assets; can raise consumer confidence and spending through the \u201cwealth effect.\u201d | Households that own stocks, bonds, or a home (\u224840\u202f% of U.S. families) see sizable gains; renters and low\u2011income households, who hold little financial wealth, see little or no direct benefit. | The \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d channel is documented in many papers (e.g., *Borio & Zabai, 2020*). However, the magnitude of consumption response is modest (0.5\u20111\u202f% of GDP per 10\u202f% rise in house prices). |\n| **Reduced real returns on safe savings** (bank deposits, Treasury bills) | Nominal yields on low\u2011risk assets fall, sometimes below inflation, eroding real returns for savers. | Retirees and risk\u2011averse savers who depend on interest income. | In Japan\u2019s long\u2011run QE, real deposit rates have been negative for decades, prompting a shift toward riskier assets or \u201ccash\u2011plus\u201d products. |\n| **Employment and wages** (through the macro channel) | QE can lower unemployment by stimulating demand, which benefits most workers. The wage boost is usually modest and uneven across sectors. | Workers in expanding industries (services, construction) gain; low\u2011skill workers may see limited wage gains if the labor market is slack. | The Federal Reserve\u2019s post\u20112008 QE is estimated to have reduced the unemployment gap by 0.5\u20111\u202fpercentage point (e.g., *Furceri et\u202fal., 2021*). The effect fades once the economy approaches full employment. |\n| **Distributional spillovers** (inflation, housing affordability) | If QE fuels house\u2011price inflation faster than wage growth, renters and first\u2011time buyers can be squeezed. | Low\u2011income renters, younger households. | Evidence from the UK\u2019s QE era (2009\u20112020) shows house\u2011price growth outpacing income growth, widening the rent\u2011to\u2011income ratio for low\u2011income tenants. |\n\n**Key uncertainties for households**  \n* The \u201cwealth effect\u201d on consumption is empirically small and may be offset by higher household debt.  \n* In economies where credit markets remain constrained (e.g., after the euro\u2011area crisis), lower policy rates do **not** always translate into cheaper mortgages.  \n* The long\u2011run impact on income inequality hinges on fiscal policy: QE alone does not redistribute; it merely reshapes the *price* of assets.\n\n---\n\n",

      "unknown_model_response": "## QE and the \u201cnon\u2011owner\u201d side of the economy  \nWhen a central bank expands its balance sheet it mainly works through **financial markets**.  People who do **not** hold the assets that rise in value (stocks, bonds, houses) feel the policy through the *real\u2011economy* channels that accompany it\u2014chiefly **credit conditions, wages, employment, and the price of rent and everyday goods**.  \n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of the main ways QE can help or hurt renters and low\u2011income families, followed by a concrete U.S. case study (the same logic applies to the UK, Euro\u2011area and Japan, with local twists).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Primary channels that reach non\u2011owners  \n\n| Channel | How it works | Typical net effect for renters / low\u2011income households | Illustrative evidence |\n|---------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Lower mortgage rates \u2192 cheaper new\u2011home financing** | QE pushes long\u2011term yields down, which reduces the cost of new mortgages. | *Indirect*: If new construction is stimulated, the supply of rental units can expand, putting downward pressure on rents. The effect is modest unless the housing\u2011stock is very tight. | U.S. **QE\u20113** (2010\u20112014) coincided with a **+1.5\u202f%/yr** increase in the number of newly built rental units (U.S. Census Bureau), but the impact was muted by local zoning constraints. |\n| **Lower corporate borrowing costs \u2192 higher investment and hiring** | Cheaper long\u2011term funding encourages firms to expand capacity, hire workers, and sometimes raise wages. | *Positive*: More jobs and potentially higher wages for low\u2011skill workers. *Negative*: If firms use cheaper credit to replace labor with automation, the net gain can be small. | Studies of the U.S. post\u20112008 QE find a **0.3\u20110.5\u202f%** rise in total private\u2011sector employment per $1\u202ftrn of QE assets (Furceri, Loungani & Ostry, 2021). The wage effect was concentrated in service sectors that employ many low\u2011skill workers. |\n| **Higher asset prices \u2192 wealth\u2011effect for owners, *no* wealth\u2011effect for renters** | QE lifts equity, bond and house prices. | *Zero or negative*: Renters cannot capture the price appreciation; they may even face higher rents if landlords raise rates to reflect higher home values. | In the U.K., between 2009\u20112014 house prices rose ~30\u202f% while the **average private\u2011rental index** grew only ~12\u202f% (ONS). The gap widened the *rent\u2011to\u2011price* ratio for renters. |\n| **Lower yields on safe assets \u2192 poorer returns on savings** | QE drives yields on Treasury bills, savings\u2011account rates, and money\u2011market funds toward zero (or negative in some countries). | *Negative*: Low\u2011income households that rely on interest income (e.g., retirees on fixed\u2011income portfolios, families with a \u201csavings\u2011first\u201d strategy) see real purchasing power erode, especially when inflation is positive. | In the U.S., the average **1\u2011year Treasury yield** fell from ~4\u202f% in 2008 to <1\u202f% by 2015. Real\u2011interest\u2011rate\u2011adjusted returns on a typical savings account were **\u20132\u202f% to \u20133\u202f%** per year during that span. |\n| **Inflation transmission** | QE can eventually lift consumer\u2011price inflation (especially if it succeeds in raising demand). | *Mixed*: If wages stay flat while prices rise, low\u2011income families lose real income. However, modest inflation can reduce the real burden of existing debt. | The Fed\u2019s post\u20112008 QE period saw CPI rise from ~2\u202f% (2008) to an average of **~1.5\u202f%** (2012\u20112015). Real wages for the bottom 20\u202f% grew only **0.2\u202f%/yr**, lagging price growth. |\n| **Credit\u2011market \u201cspill\u2011over\u201d to non\u2011mortgage borrowing** | QE can lower rates on auto loans, student loans, credit\u2011cards, and small\u2011business loans. | *Positive*: Cheaper consumer credit can reduce monthly payments for borrowers who are not homeowners. *Caveat*: Easier credit can also increase indebtedness, raising vulnerability if the economy stalls. | Auto\u2011loan rates fell from ~6\u202f% (2008) to ~4\u202f% (2014).
