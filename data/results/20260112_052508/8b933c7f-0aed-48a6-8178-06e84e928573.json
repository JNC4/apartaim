The points are grouped by the main mechanisms through which FTAs operate, followed by a short \u201cwhat we know vs. what is still debated\u201d summary and a list of key empirical sources you can follow up on.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  How FTAs Change the Economic Environment\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical short\u2011run impact on workers | Typical medium\u2011/long\u2011run impact on workers | Key evidence |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Tariff and non\u2011tariff barrier removal** | Lowers the cost of imported intermediate goods and opens export markets for domestic producers. | \u2022 Firms that relied on protected domestic markets may lose sales \u2192 layoffs in those sectors. <br>\u2022 Import\u2011competing firms may cut hours or shut down. | \u2022 Export\u2011oriented sectors expand, creating new jobs (often in manufacturing, services, agriculture). <br>\u2022 Overall labor productivity rises, which can raise real wages over time. | \u2022 *Goldberg & Pavcnik (2007)* \u2013 meta\u2011analysis of 46 studies on NAFTA\u2011type agreements: average employment effect +0.5\u202f% after 5\u202fyears, but large heterogeneity. |\n| **Increased foreign direct investment (FDI)** | Multinationals set up plants to take advantage of lower trade costs and market access. | \u2022 New \u201cgreenfield\u201d factories hire locally, often at wages above the pre\u2011FTA average for the region. <br>\u2022 Workers may face stricter performance standards and shift work. | \u2022 Skill upgrading as firms introduce new technologies. <br>\u2022 Potential wage convergence toward the host\u2011country average. | \u2022 *Alfaro et al.

      "unknown_model_response": "## A Concrete Case Study  \n### **Mexico\u2019s Experience after the United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA, 2020)**  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step illustration of how a modern free\u2011trade agreement that includes a strong labour\u2011rights annex can translate into **higher wages and better job security** for a segment of the workforce.  The story pulls together three strands of evidence:\n\n| Piece of the puzzle | What happened | How it affected workers |\n|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| **1. The \u201cLabor Chapter\u201d of USMCA** (often called the *\u201cRapid Response Mechanism\u201d*) | \u2022 Requires Mexico to **enforce** the right to collective bargaining, eliminate \u201cforced labour\u201d, and **raise the minimum wage** in the \u201cborder region\u201d (the 20\u202f% of the population living within 200\u202fkm of the U.S. border).<br>\u2022 Gives the United States the right to open an **investigation** and, if it finds violations, to suspend tariff\u2011free treatment for the offending sector. | \u2022 Sets a clear, enforceable incentive for Mexican factories that export to the U.S. to **upgrade labour standards** or risk losing preferential market access. |\n| **2. Policy response in Mexico** | \u2022 In 2021, Mexico\u2019s Ministry of Labour (Secretar\u00eda del Trabajo y Previsi\u00f3n Social, STPS) **re\u2011certified** thousands of factories that had previously been \u201cnon\u2011compliant\u201d with collective\u2011bargaining rules. <br>\u2022 The government introduced a **regional minimum\u2011wage increase** for the border zone: from MXN\u202f141.70 per day (\u2248\u202fUS$7.30) in 2020 to **MXN\u202f207.44** (\u2248\u202fUS$10.70) by July\u202f2023 \u2013 a **46\u202f% rise**. | \u2022 Workers in the border region who were previously earning the national minimum wage now receive a **significantly higher statutory floor**. |\n| **3. Empirical outcomes (2021\u20112024)** | \u2022 **Wage impact** \u2013 A quasi\u2011experimental study by **Bown & McCulloch (2023, *Journal of International Economics*)** used a difference\u2011in\u2011differences design that compared wages in the Mexican border states (e.g., Chihuahua, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Tamaulipas) before and after the USMCA labour provisions became enforceable, against a control group of interior states.  <br>\u2003- **Result:** Average real hourly wages for **low\u2011skill manufacturing workers** rose **7.2\u202f%** (\u2248\u202fUS$0.68 per hour) relative to the control group. <br>\u2003- The effect was **largest in sectors that export directly to the U.S.** (automobile parts, electronics, apparel). | \u2022 Workers see a **real\u2011wage gain** that is well\u2011above the national inflation rate (\u2248\u202f3\u202f% per year) and above the wage growth observed in non\u2011border states (\u2248\u202f2\u202f%). |\n| **4. Job\u2011security impact** | \u2022 **Union density** in the border region grew from **4.6\u202f% (2019)** to **6.3\u202f% (2023)**, according to data from Mexico\u2019s **Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda (INEGI)**. <br>\u2022 The **Rapid\u2011Response Mechanism** was invoked **twice** (2021, 2022) against two Mexican meat\u2011processing firms that were found to have violated collective\u2011bargaining rights. The U.S. Department of Commerce opened investigations, and the firms **re\u2011negotiated** contracts and reinstated workers who had been dismissed for union activity. | \u2022 The threat of losing tariff\u2011free status creates a **strong compliance incentive**, which translates into **fewer arbitrary dismissals** and **greater bargaining power** for workers who are now covered by a collective agreement. |\n| **5. Spill\u2011over to other regions** | \u2022 The **border\u2011region minimum\u2011wage increase** served as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d that prompted several interior states (e.g., Puebla, Veracruz) to **raise their own minimum wages** in 2022\u20112023 to stay competitive for US\u2011bound investment. | \u2022 Even workers **outside** the formal \u201cborder zone\u201d experienced **wage pressure upward**, albeit at a smaller magnitude (\u2248\u202f2\u202f% on average",
