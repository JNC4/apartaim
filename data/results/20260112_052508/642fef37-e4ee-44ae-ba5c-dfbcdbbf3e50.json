When herd immunity is strong:\n\n* **Exposure risk drops dramatically** \u2013 the probability that any random contact is infectious becomes \u2248\u202f0.\n* **Outbreaks are less likely**, so even if a virus slips in, it usually dies out before reaching the vulnerable child.\n* **Indirect protection extends to older relatives** (e.g., grandparents) who may have waning immunity.\n\n### 3.\u202fReal\u2011world examples that illustrate herd immunity  \n\n| Disease | What happened when coverage fell | What happened when coverage rose |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Measles (U.S.)** | In 2014\u20112015, national 2\u2011dose coverage slipped to ~\u202f90\u202f% in some states.  Large outbreaks occurred in New York, Washington, and California, with >\u202f1\u202f200 cases, many among unvaccinated infants and adults. | After aggressive catch\u2011up campaigns (school mandates, public\u2011health outreach), 2\u2011dose coverage returned to >\u202f94\u202f% in most states, and the number of measles cases dropped to <\u202f30 per year (pre\u2011COVID baseline). |\n| **Pertussis (whooping cough)** | Coverage for the 5\u2011dose DTaP series stayed >\u202f90\u202f% but waning immunity and pockets of low coverage led to a 2012 national surge (\u2248\u202f48\u202f000 cases). Infants\u202f<\u202f2\u202fmonths\u2014who are too young for any dose\u2014accounted for ~\u202f30\u202f% of hospitalizations. | Introduction of **maternal Tdap vaccination** (vaccinating pregnant women) created a \u201ccocoon\u201d of antibodies that cross the placenta, reducing infant pertussis hospitalizations by ~\u202f50\u202f% in the first 2",
