      "unknown_model_response": "### How Pasteurization Works\n\nPasteurization is a heat\u2011treatment method designed to **significantly reduce the number of pathogenic (disease\u2011causing) microorganisms** in milk while preserving most of its nutritional and sensory qualities. The process was developed by French scientist **Louis Pasteur** in the 1860s, and it remains the standard method for ensuring milk safety worldwide.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Science Behind It\n\n| Step | What Happens | Why It Matters |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Heating** | Milk is rapidly brought to a specific temperature range (usually between **71\u202f\u00b0C / 160\u202f\u00b0F and 85\u202f\u00b0C / 185\u202f\u00b0F**) and held there for a set time. | Most bacteria, especially the *heat\u2011sensitive* pathogens that cause food\u2011borne illness (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*), are destroyed at these temperatures. |\n| **Cooling** | After the hold time, the milk is quickly cooled to **4\u202f\u00b0C (39\u202f\u00b0F)** or lower. | Rapid cooling prevents any surviving microorganisms from multiplying and helps preserve flavor and vitamins. |\n| **Packaging** | The milk is sealed in sterile containers (often under a clean\u2011room environment). | Prevents re\u2011contamination after the heat treatment. |\n\nThe key principle is **thermal inactivation**: heat denatures proteins in bacterial cell walls and enzymes, disrupting metabolism and causing cell death. The exact temperature\u2011time combination is chosen to achieve a **\u22655\u2011log reduction** (99.999\u202f% kill) of the target pathogens.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Pasteurization Regimens\n\n| Regimen | Temperature | Hold Time | Typical Use |\n|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n| **HTST (High\u2011Temperature Short\u2011Time)** | **71.7\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F)** | **15\u202fseconds** | Most commercial fluid milk sold in supermarkets. |\n| **LTLT (Low\u2011Temperature Long\u2011Time) \u2013 \u201cBatch\u201d** | **63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F)** | **30\u202fminutes** | Often used for specialty dairy products, cheese\u2011making milk, and some small\u2011scale operations. |\n| **UHT (Ultra\u2011High\u2011Temperature)** | **135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F)** | **2\u20135\u202fseconds** | Produces \u201cshelf\u2011stable\u201d milk that can be stored unopened at room temperature for months. |\n| **PV (Pasteurization\u2011Valorisation) \u2013 \u201cExtended\u201d** | **72\u201375\u202f\u00b0C (162\u2013167\u202f\u00b0F)** | **30\u202fseconds \u2013 1\u202fminute** | Used for certain flavored milks and products where a slightly longer hold improves shelf\u2011life without compromising taste. |\n\n*All of these methods meet the same safety standard: a **\u22655\u2011log reduction** of *Coxiella burnetii* (the most heat\u2011resistant pathogen commonly found in milk).*\n\n---\n\n## 3. What Risks Remain After Pasteurization?\n\n1. **Post\u2011Pasteurization Contamination**  \n   - If the milk is exposed to unsanitary equipment, containers, or handling after the heat step, new bacteria can be introduced. That\u2019s why sterile packaging and hygienic bottling lines are essential.\n\n2. **Spoilage Bacteria**  \n   - Pasteurization does **not** sterilize milk; it only reduces pathogenic loads. Some non\u2011pathogenic bacteria (e.g., *Pseudomonas*, *Lactobacillus*) can survive and cause off\u2011flavors or souring over time, especially if the milk is stored above refrigeration temperatures.\n\n3. **Heat\u2011Resistant Spores**  \n   - Certain bacterial spores (e.g., *Bacillus* spp.) can survive standard pasteurization. They are generally harmless but can germinate if the milk is left warm for extended periods, leading to spoilage.\n\n4. **Nutrient Degradation (Minimal)**  \n   - A tiny fraction of heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (like vitamin C and some B\u2011vitamins) may be reduced, but the loss is **very small**\u2014often less than 5\u202f% of the original content. The overall nutritional profile remains essentially unchanged.\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nWhen performed correctly\u2014**accurate temperature control, precise timing, rapid cooling, and",
