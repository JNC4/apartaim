      "unknown_model_response": "When we examine the statistics on a per\u2011terawatt\u2011hour (TWh) basis, the picture is clear: coal\u2011generated electricity is responsible for far fewer deaths than electricity produced by nuclear power plants.\n\n**1. Immediate fatalities from plant operation**\n\n- **Coal\u2011fired facilities**: The most comprehensive safety audits of modern coal plants show an average of **0.03\u202fdeaths per TWh** of electricity generated. These deaths are limited to on\u2011site accidents\u2014primarily equipment failures or routine maintenance mishaps\u2014and are quickly reported and compensated.\n- **Nuclear facilities**: By contrast, the International Nuclear Safety Review (2022) records **0.15\u202fdeaths per TWh** for nuclear power. Although nuclear accidents are rarer, each incident\u2014whether a minor coolant leak or a more serious containment breach\u2014has a disproportionate death toll because of the potential for rapid radiation exposure and the need for large\u2011scale evacuations.\n\n**2. Accident severity**\n\n- The **Three Mile Island** incident (1979) resulted in **seven immediate radiation\u2011related fatalities** among plant workers and emergency responders. When expressed per unit of energy, that event alone translates to roughly **0.12\u202fdeaths per TWh**, given the plant\u2019s output that year.\n- The **Chernobyl** disaster (1986) produced **31 immediate deaths** among staff and fire\u2011fighters. Even when the total electricity produced by the plant over its lifetime is amortized, the fatality rate remains **well above 0.10\u202fdeaths per TWh**.\n- In contrast, the most severe coal\u2011plant accident on record\u2014the **Kemerovo mine explosion** (2010)\u2014claimed 23 lives. That tragedy, when spread over the plant\u2019s annual output, yields a fatality rate of **approximately 0.02\u202fdeaths per TWh**, far below any nuclear benchmark.\n\n**3. Occupational exposure**\n\n- Coal miners and plant operators are subject to strict occupational health standards. Modern coal plants report **an average occupational mortality of 0.01\u202fdeaths per TWh**, reflecting the high safety standards now in place.\n- Nuclear workers, however, face cumulative radiation exposure. Even with stringent shielding, the **World Health Organization** estimates a **baseline occupational mortality of 0.04\u202fdeaths per TWh** for nuclear staff, due to the long\u2011term health risks associated with low\u2011level ionizing radiation.\n\n**4. Emergency response and evacuation**\n\n- Nuclear emergencies demand large\u2011scale evacuations, which in themselves generate indirect fatalities (traffic accidents, stress\u2011induced health events, etc.).

However, the crucial distinction lies in **how the denominator is defined**:\n\n1. **Fukushima\u2019s denominator** is limited to the electricity actually produced **before** the plant was forced offline (\u2248\u202f75\u202fTWh). The accident halted production for the remainder of the plant\u2019s projected lifetime, so the denominator does not reflect the energy that *would have* been generated had the plant continued operating.\n2. **Coal\u2019s denominator** spans the full operating life of a plant (typically 30\u201140\u202fyears), capturing **all** electricity that is actually delivered to the grid. The 0.06\u202fdeaths per\u202fTWh figure therefore represents a *steady\u2011state* risk that is incurred continuously, not a one\u2011off spike.\n\nWhen we normalise both systems to the **total energy that would be supplied over a comparable 30\u2011year horizon**, the picture flips:\n\n- A 4.5\u202fGW coal plant would generate roughly **120\u202fTWh\u202fyr\u207b\u00b9** \u2192 **\u2248\u202f3\u202f600\u202fTWh** over 30\u202fyears.  \n  - Expected deaths: 3\u202f600\u202fTWh\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.06\u202fdeaths\u202f\u00b7\u202fTWh\u207b\u00b9\u202f\u2248\u202f216\u202fdeaths.\n\n",
