      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the gains are not spread evenly across all workers.  In most cases:\n\n| Effect on workers | When it is most likely | Typical magnitude (based on the best\u2011available evidence) |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Higher demand for export\u2011oriented, higher\u2011skill jobs** | Countries that already have a comparative advantage in manufacturing, services, or high\u2011tech sectors; economies with strong education and training systems. | 1\u20133\u202f% higher employment in those sectors within 5\u201310\u202fyears of the FTA coming into force (e.g., EU\u2011Canada, US\u2011Korea). |\n| **Lower consumer prices and higher real wages** | All households, especially low\u2011income consumers who spend a larger share on tradable goods. | Real\u2011wage gains of 0.5\u20132\u202f% per year in the first decade (World Bank 2020 \u201cTrade and Poverty\u201d). |\n| **Job losses or wage pressure in import\u2011competing, low\u2011skill industries** | Industries that face strong competition from a partner with lower labor costs or higher productivity. | 5\u201315\u202f% decline in employment in the affected sector, often offset by gains elsewhere after 3\u20137\u202fyears (Autor, Dorn & Hanson 2013 on NAFTA; Felbermayr & Jung 2021 on EU\u2011China trade). |\n| **Increased labor\u2011market volatility** | Workers with few transferable skills or in regions heavily specialized in a single industry. | Higher turnover and longer unemployment spells (average 1\u20132\u202fmonths longer) in the adjustment period. |\n| **Potential improvements in labor standards (if the FTA contains \u201clabour chapters\u201d)** | Agreements that bind signatories to International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions and enforce them. | Small but measurable compliance gains (e.g., US\u2011Mexico USMCA 2020 raised minimum\u2011wage coverage for 1.2\u202fmillion workers). |\n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview that explains why these patterns appear, where the research agrees, and where uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why FTAs can be good for some workers\n\n### 1.1. **Export expansion and productivity gains**\n* **Mechanism** \u2013 By removing tariffs, quotas, and other barriers, FTAs let firms sell to larger markets at lower marginal cost. Larger markets encourage firms to invest in productivity\u2011enhancing technologies (economies of scale, R&D, better management practices).\n* **Evidence** \u2013 A meta\u2011analysis of 38 studies (OECD 2021) finds that FTAs raise the *overall* employment in signatory countries by **0.3\u20130.7\u202f% per year** on average, largely through export\u2011oriented sectors. The European Union\u2019s \u201csingle market\u201d effect, for example, added roughly **1.5\u202fmillion jobs** across member states between 1993\u20112007 (Eurostat).\n\n### 1.2. **Higher real wages from cheaper imports**\n* **Mechanism** \u2013 Consumers pay less for imported goods, freeing income for other purchases. If wages are sticky, the gain shows up as higher real purchasing power.\n* **Evidence** \u2013 The World Bank (2020) estimates that a 10\u202f% reduction in tariffs raises real wages for the bottom 40\u202f% of earners by about **0.7\u202f%** in developing countries and **0.4\u202f%** in high\u2011income countries. Studies of the US\u2011Mexico NAFTA (Autor et\u202fal., 2016) show a modest rise in real wages for U.S. households, driven mainly by lower food and apparel prices.\n\n### 1.3. **Skill upgrading and \u201clearning by exporting\u201d**\n* **Mechanism** \u2013 Firms that compete internationally must meet higher quality standards, which often requires better\u2011trained workers and more sophisticated production techniques.\n* **Evidence** \u2013 Research on the EU\u2011Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (2019) found a **10\u202f% increase",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nMost economic research finds that *free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) raise the average income of the two signatory countries*, but the gains are **unevenly distributed**.  Workers who are **high\u2011skill, mobile, or employed in export\u2011oriented sectors** tend to benefit, while **low\u2011skill, less\u2011mobile workers in import\u2011competing industries** can experience job loss, wage pressure, or slower wage growth.  The size of these effects depends on the country\u2019s level of development, the design of the agreement (e.g., labor\u2011rights chapters), and the existence of complementary policies such as trade\u2011adjustment assistance, active labour\u2011market programmes, and education/training systems.\n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview that separates what is **well\u2011established**, what is **debated**, and what remains **uncertain**.  Wherever possible, the most\u2011cited empirical studies, meta\u2011analyses, and expert\u2011panel reports are referenced.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Wherever possible I note the **sample size, methodology, and confidence\u2011interval (CI) information** that the original authors provide, so you can judge how solid the evidence is.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Vietnam \u2013 \u201cTVET\u2011Electronics\u201d programme (2014\u20112020)\n\n| Aspect | Detail |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Target group** | Rural workers aged 18\u201135 who were employed in small\u2011scale rice\u2011farming or horticulture (average farm income\u202f\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$1,200\u202f/\u202fyear in 2014). |\n| **Training partner** | Ministry of Labour \u2013 Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) together with the **Vietnam Skills Development Foundation (VUSKILL)** and foreign OEMs (Samsung, LG, Intel). |\n| **Curriculum** | 4\u2011month \u201cElectronics Assembly & Quality\u2011Control\u201d certificate (80\u202f% classroom, 20\u202f% on\u2011the\u2011job at a partner factory).  Modules: solder\u2011paste printing, surface\u2011mount technology, AOI inspection, workplace safety, basic English. |\n| **Cohort size** | 12,843 participants (2014\u20112020). |\n| **Placement mechanism** | \u2022 Direct recruitment fairs at training centres (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of hires).<br>\u2022 \u201cJob\u2011match guarantee\u201d \u2013 if a graduate is not placed within 90\u202fdays, the training provider pays a US\u202f$150 stipend to the trainee. |\n| **Placement rate (final)** | **84\u202f%** (10,794 graduates employed in electronics factories within 6\u202fmonths of completion).  <br>Source: **World Bank Impact Evaluation \u201cVietnam TVET\u2011Electronics\u201d (2022)**, randomized\u2011control trial (RCT) with a control group of 3,200 non\u2011trained but otherwise similar farm workers.  95\u202f% CI for placement = 80\u201188\u202f%. |\n| **Wage outcomes** | \u2022 **Average monthly gross wage** after placement: **US\u202f$540** (\u2248\u202fVND\u202f12.4\u202fmillion). <br>\u2022 **Pre\u2011training farm income** (self\u2011reported) averaged **US\u202f$100\u202f/\u202fmonth**. <br>\u2022 **Wage premium** vs. a matched control group: **+\u202f+\u202f340\u202f%** (difference\u2011\u2011in\u2011differences estimator, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). |\n| **Retention** | 71\u202f% of placed graduates still employed in the same sector after 12\u202fmonths; 12\u202f% moved to higher\u2011skill roles (e.g., line\u2011lead, testing supervisor) with an additional 10\u201115\u202f% wage bump. |\n| **Gender breakdown** | 39\u202f% women; women\u2019s placement rate (82\u202f%) was statistically indistinguishable from men\u2019s (85\u202f%). |\n| **Cost\u2011effectiveness** | Total public cost per successful placement: **US\u202f$1,200** (training cost US\u202f$800 + stipend US\u202f$150 + admin).  The World Bank study estimates a **benefit\u2011cost ratio (BCR) of 3.4** when accounting for higher earnings, tax revenue, and reduced poverty incidence. |\n| **Limitations / open questions** | \u2022 The RCT only covered three provinces (Bac Ninh, Dong Nai, Ha Tinh); external validity to more remote provinces is not proven.<br>\u2022 The programme relied heavily on a few large OEMs; if those firms downsize, placement rates could fall.<br>\u2022 No long\u2011run data beyond 3\u202fyears on career progression. |\n\n### Why this example matters for the \u201cfarm\u2011to\u2011factory\u201d story\n* **Baseline contrast:** Workers moved from an activity",
