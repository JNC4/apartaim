      "unknown_model_response": "**1. What sanctions are meant to do**\n\n| Goal | How it is supposed to work | Typical tools |\n|------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| **Coercive pressure** (change a specific policy or action) | Reduce the target\u2019s *revenue* or *costs* so the expected benefits of the undesired behaviour become lower than the costs of continuing it. | Trade bans, asset freezes, financial\u2011sector restrictions, secondary sanctions on third\u2011party firms. |\n| **Deterrence** (prevent future violations) | Signal that certain actions will be met with costly consequences, raising the perceived risk of non\u2011compliance. | Threats of additional rounds of sanctions, \u201cswift\u2011punishment\u201d clauses. |\n| **Punishment/Norm\u2011setting** (express condemnation) | Demonstrate international disapproval; the target may alter behaviour to avoid diplomatic isolation. | Wide\u2011scale embargoes, travel bans on elites. |\n| **Compellence via domestic pressure** (force internal opposition) | By hurting the economy, sanctions are expected to create public discontent that pressures the regime to concede. | Broad\u2011based oil or commodity bans, restrictions on banking that affect inflation and unemployment. |\n\n*Mechanisms* that link the policy tools to the desired outcome:\n\n1. **Revenue loss** \u2013 Cutting off export markets (e.g., oil, minerals, high\u2011tech goods) reduces the government\u2019s fiscal capacity.\n2. **Financial isolation** \u2013 Removing access to the global banking system raises the cost of external borrowing and hampers payment for imports.\n3. **Supply\u2011chain disruption** \u2013 Blocking critical inputs (technology, spare parts) raises the cost of maintaining military or industrial capabilities.\n4. **Signal effects** \u2013 Even if the material impact is modest, the *political* message can alter the calculus of decision\u2011makers or embolden opposition groups.\n\n**2. How success is measured**\n\n| Metric | What it captures | Typical data sources |\n|--------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **Policy compliance** (e.g., nuclear\u2011non\u2011proliferation, cease\u2011fire) | Direct achievement of the stated objective. | UN Security Council resolutions, treaty\u2011monitoring reports. |\n| **Behavioral change** (e.g., reduced human\u2011rights violations, electoral reforms) | More diffuse outcomes; often assessed via NGO indices or expert surveys. | Freedom House, Amnesty International, World Bank governance indicators. |\n| **Economic impact on target** (GDP decline, inflation, fiscal deficit) | Intended pressure mechanism; can be a proxy for \u201cpain\u201d inflicted. | IMF, World Bank, national statistical agencies. |\n| **Cost to the sanctioning country** (lost trade, diplomatic fallout) | Whether the benefits outweigh the domestic costs. | Trade statistics, public\u2011opinion polls. |\n\n**3. What the empirical literature says**\n\n1. **Overall success rate is modest**  \n   * Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009) examined 168 sanctions episodes (1950\u20112000) and found that **\u224834\u202f%** achieved their primary coercive goal.  \n   * Drezner (2011) later updated the sample (1990\u20112010) and estimated a success rate of **\u224830\u201140\u202f%**, noting higher success when sanctions are *multilateral* and *targeted* (rather than comprehensive embargoes).\n\n2. **Conditions that improve effectiveness**  \n   * **Multilateral participation** \u2013 The probability of success rises by 2\u20113\u202fpercentage points for each additional major power that joins (Hufbauer et\u202fal., 2009).  \n   * **Clear, limited objectives** \u2013 When the demand is specific (\u201crelease X prisoners\u201d) success is higher than when goals are vague (\u201cpromote democracy\u201d).  \n   * **Targeted design** \u2013 Sanctions that focus on elites (asset freezes, travel bans) tend to avoid broad humanitarian harm and keep domestic support in the sanctioning country (Pape, 1997).  \n   * **Strong enforcement and threat of secondary sanctions** \u2013 Reduces \u201cleakage\u201d through third\u2011party countries (Kirshner, 2020).\n\n3. **Factors that undermine effectiveness**  \n   * **Economic resilience or alternative partners** \u2013 Countries with large domestic resources (e.g., Russia\u2019s energy reserves) or who can pivot trade to non\u2011aligned states (China, Iran) experience weaker pressure.  \n   * **Regime type** \u2013 Autocratic regimes often survive sanctions by reallocating resources to the security apparatus and suppressing dissent (Galtung,",
