Molecular & Genetic Characterization** | Verify exactly what DNA has been inserted, where, and how it behaves. | \u2022 DNA sequencing of the insert and flanking regions <br>\u2022 Copy\u2011number determination (qPCR, Southern blot) <br>\u2022 Stability of the insertion over generations <br>\u2022 Expression levels of the new protein(s) (Western blot, ELISA, mass spectrometry) | Confirms that the engineered change is what the developer intends and that no unintended genes or rearrangements have been introduced. |\n| **2. Compositional Analysis** | Check whether the GM food\u2019s nutrients, antinutrients, and natural toxins are equivalent to a conventional counterpart. | \u2022 Broad chemical profiling (macro\u2011 and micronutrients, vitamins, fatty acids, amino acids) <br>\u2022 Levels of known natural toxins (e.g., glycoalkaloids in potatoes) <br>\u2022 Comparison with a range of non\u2011GM reference varieties grown in the same environment | Detects any substantial differences that could affect nutrition or raise safety concerns. |\n| **3. Toxicology & Allergenicity Assessment** | Determine whether the newly expressed protein(s) or any other component could be harmful. | **Protein\u2011level tests**: <br>\u2003\u2022 In\u2011silico similarity searches (e.g., BLAST) against known toxins and allergens <br>\u2003\u2022 Digestibility assays (simulated gastric/intestinal enzymes) <br>\u2003\u2022 Heat stability tests <br>**Animal feeding studies** (usually 90\u2011day sub\u2011chronic rodent studies): <br>\u2003\u2022 Whole\u2011food diets (GM vs. isogenic non\u2011GM) <br>\u2003\u2022 Clinical pathology, organ weights, histopathology <br>**Human data (when available)**: <br>\u2003\u2022 Controlled human feeding trials, post\u2011market surveillance | \u2022 Lack of sequence similarity to known toxins/allergens and rapid digestion suggest low allergenic potential. <br>\u2022 Animal studies that show no adverse effects at doses far exceeding expected human consumption support safety. |\n| **4. Environmental & Post\u2011Market Monitoring** (optional but increasingly required) | Ensure that the GM crop does not create new hazards after release (e.g., gene flow, unintended metabolites). | \u2022 Field trials for unintended phenotypes <br>\u2022 Monitoring for horizontal gene transfer <br>\u2022 Long\u2011term epidemiological studies (e.g., cancer registries, allergy incidence) | Provides an extra safety net and helps detect rare or delayed effects that might not appear in controlled studies. |\n\nBelow is a more detailed walk\u2011through of each step, the scientific rationale behind it, and examples of data that have been generated for the most widely cultivated GM crops (e.g., Bt corn, Roundup Ready soy, GM papaya, Golden Rice).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Molecular & Genetic Characterization  \n\n| **What is examined?** | **Why it matters?** | **Typical methods** |\n|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| **Insert sequence** (the transgene) | Guarantees that the intended gene (e.g., Cry1Ab for insect resistance) is present and unchanged. | DNA sequencing (Sanger or next\u2011generation) of the construct. |\n| **Flanking regions** (DNA on either side of the insert) | Detects any disruption of native genes that could affect plant metabolism. | Southern blot, PCR walking, whole\u2011genome resequencing. |\n| **Copy number** | Multiple copies can increase expression, possibly leading to higher exposure to the novel protein. | Quantitative PCR (qPCR), digital PCR. |\n| **Stability over generations** | Ensures the insert",

These levels are far below the doses that cause any effect in mammals (see toxicology section). |\n| **Stability over generations** | Confirm that the insert and expression are unchanged after many breeding cycles. | Multi\u2011generation field trials (\u2265\u202f10 generations) showed no sequence drift or loss of expression (USDA\u2011ARS, 2004). |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The molecular picture is *exactly* what the developer intended\u2014a single, well\u2011characterized *cry* gene expressed at low levels in the edible part of the plant, with no unintended DNA changes.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
