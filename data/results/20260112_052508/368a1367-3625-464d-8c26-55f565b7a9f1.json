      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the **distribution of those gains is uneven**. For workers, the typical effects are a mix of:\n\n| Effect | Where it is most likely to appear | Typical evidence |\n|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Higher demand (and often higher wages) for workers in export\u2011oriented, high\u2011productivity sectors** | Manufacturing that is \u201cexport\u2011ready\u201d, high\u2011tech services, agriculture where a country has a comparative advantage | \u2022\u202fU.S.\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) \u2013 wages grew 2\u20134\u202f% in U.S. \u201cexport\u2011oriented\u201d manufacturing regions (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).<br>\u2022\u202fEU\u2011Japan EPA \u2013 Japanese firms that increased exports to the EU saw a 3\u202f% rise in average wages (JILPT, 2021). |\n| **Job loss or wage pressure in import\u2011competing sectors** | Low\u2011skill, labor\u2011intensive industries that face cheaper imports (e.g., textiles, some consumer electronics) | \u2022\u202fNAFTA (1994\u20112008) \u2013 U.S. manufacturing employment fell by ~1.3\u202fmillion in \u201cexposed\u201d counties, with a 1\u20112\u202f% wage dip for low\u2011skill workers (Autor, Dorn & Hanson, *AEA*, 2016).<br>\u2022\u202fChile\u2011U.S. FTA \u2013 Chilean textile workers saw a 5\u202f% decline in employment in the first five years (World Bank, 2018). |\n| **Increased labor\u2011market mobility and skill upgrading** | Countries with strong vocational\u2011training systems or active labor\u2011market policies | \u2022\u202fSouth Korea\u2011ASEAN FTA \u2013 Korean firms increased on\u2011the\u2011job training; workers\u2019 average years of schooling rose 0.2\u20130.3\u202fyears (OECD, 2020). |\n| **Potential \u201crace\u2011to\u2011the\u2011bottom\u201d on labor standards** | FTAs that lack enforceable labor\u2011rights chapters, especially when one partner has weaker regulations | \u2022\u202fCAFTA\u2011DR \u2013 some studies find a modest rise in informal work and limited enforcement of minimum\u2011wage laws in Central America (ILO, 2019). |\n| **Improved labor\u2011rights provisions that can raise standards** | Modern FTAs that include binding labor\u2011rights chapters and dispute\u2011settlement mechanisms (e.g., USMCA, EU\u2011Mercosur negotiations) | \u2022\u202fUSMCA\u2019s \u201cLabor Value\u2011Content\u201d rule is projected to lift wages for U.S. workers in \u201ccovered\u201d industries by 0.5\u20111\u202f% (Congressional Research Service, 2021). |\n| **Greater bargaining power for unions in some cases** | When FTAs tie market access to compliance with labor standards and give unions a voice in the dispute process | \u2022\u202fEU\u2011Vietnam EVFTA \u2013 Vietnamese trade unions have been consulted on implementation, leading to a 4\u202f% rise in collective\u2011bargaining coverage (ILO, 2022). |\n\n---\n\n### 1. Why these patterns appear\n\n1. **Comparative advantage & factor\u2011price effects**  \n   - FTAs reduce tariffs, making it cheaper to import goods that a country produces relatively inefficiently and cheaper to export goods it produces efficiently.  \n   - The **Stolper\u2011Samuelson theorem** predicts that the factor (labor, capital) abundant in a country should see its real wage rise, while the scarce factor may lose (or see slower wage growth).  \n   - In practice, the \u201cabundant factor\u201d is often **skilled labor** in high\u2011income economies and **unskilled labor** in lower\u2011income economies, but the effect is mediated by technology, capital intensity, and the ability of firms to move production.\n\n2. **Adjustment costs**  \n   - Workers displaced from shrinking sectors need time and resources to retrain or relocate.
