      "truthbot_response": "Below is a **complete, evidence\u2011grounded walk\u2011through** of the channels through which **lower policy\u2011rate\u2011related interest rates (the core output of QE)** affect a low\u2011income renter who **does not own a home and keeps most of his/her liquid wealth in a savings\u2011type account (e.g., a regular deposit account, a money\u2011market fund, or a short\u2011term Treasury\u2011bill \u201csavings\u201d vehicle).**  \n\nI break the answer into **four parts**:\n\n1. **What \u201clower rates\u201d really mean after QE** \u2013 the macro\u2011financial backdrop.  \n2. **Direct effects on the nominal return of a savings account** (the \u201cinterest\u2011income\u201d channel).  \n3. **Indirect effects that matter to a renter\u2019s budget** (credit\u2011cost channel, inflation\u2011adjusted purchasing power, and the \u201cwealth\u2011effect\u201d channel).  \n4. **A concrete, data\u2011driven example** that strings the pieces together for a typical household.\n\nEverything is anchored to peer\u2011reviewed papers, central\u2011bank research, or official statistics; where the literature is mixed I note the disagreement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The macro\u2011financial backdrop after a QE round  \n\n| QE\u2011induced change | How the central bank creates it | Typical magnitude (U.S. QE\u20112, QE\u20113, QE\u20114) |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Policy\u2011rate floor stays at 0\u202f%** (the Fed\u2019s federal\u2011funds target). | The Fed sets the short\u2011run policy rate; QE does **not** lower it further once it hits the lower bound. | 0\u202f% \u2013 0.25\u202f% (unchanged). |\n| **Long\u2011term Treasury yields fall** (10\u2011yr Treasury down 30\u201150\u202fbps per QE round). | The Fed buys large volumes of Treasuries \u2192 higher demand \u2192 price up \u2192 yield down. | QE\u20112: \u201340\u202fbps; QE\u20113: \u201335\u202fbps; QE\u20114 (2022\u201123): \u201345\u202fbps on average. |\n| **Bank reserves surge** (Fed balance\u2011sheet > $8\u202ftrn after 2020 QE). | New reserves are created when the Fed purchases assets. | +$4\u2011$5\u202ftrn per major QE round. |\n| **Short\u2011term market rates (e.g., 3\u2011mo LIBOR, SOFR) fall** as banks compete for the excess reserves. | Banks lend to each other at lower rates; the \u201covernight indexed swap\u201d (OIS) curve compresses. | 3\u2011mo OIS fell from ~0.5\u202f% pre\u2011QE to near 0\u202f% during QE. |\n\n**Key takeaway:** The *nominal* yield on **very short\u2011term, low\u2011risk savings instruments** (e.g., a typical FDIC\u2011insured savings account) is **tied to these short\u2011term market rates**. When QE pushes those rates toward zero, the *interest\u2011income* that a saver receives shrinks dramatically.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Direct \u201cinterest\u2011income\u201d channel  \n\n| Savings vehicle | Typical pre\u2011QE (\u2248\u202f2010) nominal rate | Typical post\u2011QE (\u2248\u202f2011\u20112012) nominal rate | Empirical source |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Traditional FDIC\u2011insured savings account** (large\u2011bank average) | 0.30\u202f% \u2013 0.40\u202f% (annual) | 0.05\u202f% \u2013 0.10\u202f% | FDIC \u201cBanking Statistics\u201d (quarterly). |\n| **Money\u2011market mutual fund (government\u2011type)** | 0.50\u202f% \u2013 0.70\u202f% | 0.10\u202f% \u2013 0.25% | Investment Company Institute (ICI) \u201cMoney\u2011Market Fund Statistics\u201d. |\n| **30\u2011day Treasury bill** | 0.35\u202f% \u2013 0.45\u202f% | 0.02\u202f% \u2013 0.08% | Treasury \u201cDaily Treasury Yield Curve\u201d. |\n\n### Empirical consensus\n\n* **Strong consensus** (see, e.g., *Bernanke & Gertler 1999*, *Kuttner 2018*, *Borio et\u202fal. 2022*) that **QE depresses short\u2011term yields** and therefore **lowers the nominal return on low\u2011risk savings**.  \n* **Magnitude**: Across the three major",
