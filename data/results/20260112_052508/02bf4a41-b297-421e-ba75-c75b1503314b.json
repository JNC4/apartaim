Pressure the ruling National Party to dismantle the legal framework of apartheid. <br>2. Signal international repudiation of the regime. | The goals were **clear, limited, and reversible** \u2013 end apartheid and move toward a democratic constitution. |\n| **Timeline of impact** | \u2022 1985\u201186: UN and U.S. pass the first major arms embargo. <br>\u2022 1986\u201188: European Community introduces a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d embargo on new investment and a ban on the import of South\u2011African gold and diamonds. <br>\u2022 1989\u201190: Targeted asset\u2011freeze orders on 33 senior officials (including then\u2011President P.\u202fW.\u202fBotha). <br>\u2022 1990: F.\u202fW.\u202fde\u202fKlerk announces the unbanning of anti\u2011apartheid parties and the release of Nelson\u202fMandela. | Economists estimate that **the combined sanctions cut South\u2011African foreign direct investment by 30\u201140\u202f%** and **raised the cost of maintaining the apartheid security apparatus by roughly 15\u201120\u202f%** (see Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal., 2007, pp.\u202f311\u2011315). |\n| **Outcome** | By 1994 South Africa held its first fully democratic elections, and the apartheid legal regime was formally repealed. | The **majority of scholars** (Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2007; Giumelli\u202f2020) classify the episode as a **successful sanction case** because the target **changed the specific policy** that the coalition demanded. |\n\n#### Why the South\u2011African case is often cited as a success\n\n1. **Broad participation** \u2013 The UN Security Council resolution gave the sanctions a legal \u201cseal of approval,\u201d while the U.S., EU, and other major economies supplied the economic muscle. This limited the ability of the regime to shift trade to a single friendly partner.\n\n2. **Precision** \u2013 By freezing assets and restricting travel of the *political and business elite* rather than imposing a blanket embargo on all South\u2011African citizens, the sanctions kept humanitarian imports flowing and avoided the backlash that can erode domestic support for the sanctioning coalition.\n\n3. **Clear, limited objective** \u2013 The demand was not \u201cregime change\u201d but \u201cthe end of the apartheid legal system.\u201d That made it possible to measure compliance (the repeal of apartheid laws) and to lift the measures once the goal was met.\n\n4. **Complementary diplomatic pressure** \u2013 The sanctions were coupled with high\u2011level diplomatic engagement (e.g., the 1986 \u201cConstructive Engagement\u201d debate in the U.S., secret talks between the African National Congress and the South\u2011African government). The *carrot\u2011and\u2011stick* mix helped the regime see a credible path to relief.\n\n---\n\n### How this example aligns with the empirical findings you mentioned\n\n| Empirical predictor | What the South\u2011African case shows |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Multilateralism** | The 34\u202f% average success rate in Hufbauer\u202fet\u202fal. jumps to **\u2248\u202f55\u202f%** when many states act together",
