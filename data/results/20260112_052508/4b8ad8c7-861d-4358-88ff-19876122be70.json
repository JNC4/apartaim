      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions are a tool of foreign policy that aim to alter a target country\u2019s behavior by creating economic pressure.**  \nHow that pressure translates into a policy change depends on a chain of mechanisms, on the characteristics of the target, and on the design of the sanction regime. Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step overview, followed by the main findings from the scholarly literature and a short guide to the biggest sources of uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic causal chain\n\n| Step | What happens | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Target\u2019s economy is hit** | \u2022 Trade bans (e.g., embargoes on oil, technology, food)  <br>\u2022 Financial restrictions (blocking access to SWIFT, asset freezes) <br>\u2022 Investment curbs, secondary sanctions on third\u2011party firms | Reduces export revenues, raises import costs, limits access to foreign capital and technology. |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Domestic costs rise** | \u2022 Government revenue falls \u2192 budget deficits, cuts to public services or subsidies <br>\u2022 Inflation and scarcity of goods \u2192 lower real wages, shortages, black\u2011market activity <br>\u2022 Business sector loses markets, foreign investors withdraw | The ruling elite and the broader population feel the pain. The cost of \u201cmaintaining the undesirable policy\u201d becomes tangible. |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Political pressure builds** | \u2022 Elite factions (e.g., ministries, military, oligarchs) may lobby for policy change to protect their own interests. <br>\u2022 Public discontent can trigger protests, strikes, or loss of electoral support (where elections exist). | Sanctions create *incentives* for internal actors to push the government toward a different course. |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Decision point** | \u2022 Government may **comply** (e.g., abandon a nuclear program, release hostages). <br>\u2022 Government may **resist** (by finding work\u2011arounds, deepening authoritarian control). <br>\u2022 Government may **negotiate** a compromise. | The outcome depends on the relative weight of costs vs. perceived benefits of the original policy. |\n\n*Key insight:* Sanctions work **only if the cost side of the equation grows faster than the perceived benefits** of the behavior they aim to stop.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Factors that determine whether the chain succeeds\n\n| Category | Important variables | Effect on sanction success |\n|----------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Target\u2019s economic structure** | \u2022 Dependence on the sanctioned sector (e.g., oil for Russia, minerals for North Korea). <br>\u2022 Availability of alternative trade partners (e.g., China, Iran). | High dependence + few alternatives \u2192 higher impact. |\n| **Political regime type** | \u2022 Autocratic vs. democratic. <br>\u2022 Presence of \u201celite bargains\u201d (power\u2011sharing among military, party, business). | Democracies are more sensitive to public hardship; autocracies can insulate elites but may still feel elite pressure. |\n| **Sanction design** | \u2022 **Multilateral** (UN, EU, G7) vs. unilateral. <br>\u2022 **Comprehensive** (broad trade/finance) vs. **targeted** (specific individuals, sectors). <br>\u2022 **Secondary** sanctions that punish third\u2011party firms for dealing with the target. | Multilateral, comprehensive, and secondary measures raise the *cost of evasion* and increase success rates. |\n| **Duration and credibility** | \u2022 Clear timeline or \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d signals. <br>\u2022 Consistency (no frequent lifting/re\u2011imposition). | Predictable, credible threats make the target more likely to calculate a payoff to compliance. |\n| **Domestic political context** | \u2022 Economic resilience, reserves, informal networks. <br>\u2022 Nationalist sentiment that can turn sanctions into a rallying\u2011cry. | Strong nationalist narratives can blunt the pressure; large foreign\u2011exchange reserves can cushion short\u2011term shocks. |\n| **External support for the target** | \u2022 Military aid, investment, or diplomatic backing from a major power. | Offsets the pressure and often leads to sanction failure (e.g., Iran\u2019s ties to China, Russia\u2019s energy sales to India). |\n\n---\n\n## 3. What the empirical literature says\n\n| Study / Dataset | Scope | Main finding |\n|-----------------|------|--------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2007, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*)** | 191 cases (1970\u20112005) | **\u2248 34\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their stated political goals; success",

The loss of hard currency forced cuts in the defence budget and created a fiscal deficit. |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Domestic costs rise** | \u2022 Unemployment rose from ~12\u202f% (1985) to >\u202f20\u202f% (1990).  <br>\u2022 Inflation surged (double\u2011digit in the late 1980s).  <br>\u2022 Shortages of imported consumer goods (cars, electronics) sparked public discontent, especially among the white middle class that had previously been insulated. | Economic hardship eroded the \u201csocial contract\u201d that kept many white South Africans supportive of the regime. Business leaders began to lobby for reform to protect their own interests. |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Political pressure builds** | \u2022 **Elite dissent** \u2013 prominent businessmen (e.g., Harry Oppenheimer) and some cabinet ministers publicly called for negotiations.  <br>\u2022 **Labor unrest** \u2013 the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) organized massive strikes in 1985\u201186, demanding both economic and political change.  <br>\u2022 **International isolation** \u2013 South Africa was expelled from the Commonwealth (1990) and barred from the Olympics (1988). | The combination of elite and mass pressure created a *policy\u2011coalition* inside the ruling National Party that favored a negotiated settlement over continued repression. |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Decision point** | \u2022 **1990** \u2013 President F.\u202fW.\u202fde\u202fKlerk announced the unbanning of anti\u2011apartheid organisations (ANC, PAC) and the release of Nelson Mandela.  <br>\u2022 **1991\u201194** \u2013 Negotiations led to the interim constitution and the first democratic elections (1994). | The government concluded that the **costs of maintaining apartheid (economic collapse, loss of elite support, risk of civil war)** now outweighed the perceived benefits (racial hierarchy, control of mineral wealth).
