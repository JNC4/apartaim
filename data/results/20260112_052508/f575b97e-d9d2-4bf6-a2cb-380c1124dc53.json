      "unknown_model_response": "## Why Vacancy Rates Stay Low under Rent\u2011Control  \n*(and what that means for people looking for a home)*  \n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step explanation that links the **mechanics of the law** to the **behaviour of landlords and tenants**, and then to the **observable outcomes** (low vacancies, long wait\u2011lists, higher prices elsewhere).  I use San\u202fFrancisco as the running example because it has the longest, best\u2011documented record, but the same causal chain appears in many other cities (New\u202fYork, Los\u202fAngeles, Berlin, Stockholm, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fThe legal \u201clock\u2011in\u201d effect\n\n| Legal feature | What it does | Direct behavioural consequence |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Vacancy\u2011control** (the rent ceiling follows the unit when the tenant leaves) | The landlord cannot \u201creset\u201d the rent to market level at turnover. | **Landlords have a strong incentive to keep the current tenant** because the rent they can charge to a new tenant will be *much lower* than the market rent. |\n| **Just\u2011cause eviction rules** (e.g., \u201cno\u2011fault\u201d eviction prohibited) | The landlord may only evict for a narrow set of reasons (non\u2011payment, substantial breach, owner\u2011occupancy, major renovation). | **Barriers to evicting a rent\u2011controlled tenant** raise the *cost* (legal fees, time, uncertainty) of trying to free a unit for a higher\u2011paying renter. |\n| **Limited \u201ccapital\u2011improvement\u201d rent hikes** (often capped at 2\u20115\u202f% of the base rent) | Even after a costly upgrade, the landlord cannot recoup the full cost through a rent increase. | **Renovation becomes less financially attractive**, so landlords are less likely to upgrade or even to keep the unit in the rental market. |\n\n**Result:** A rent\u2011controlled unit becomes a *long\u2011term, low\u2011cost asset* for the tenant, and a *low\u2011yield, hard\u2011to\u2011exit asset* for the landlord. The natural \u201cchurn\u201d that would generate vacancies in a free\u2011market rental market is dramatically slowed.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fHow the lock\u2011in translates into low vacancy rates\n\n| Step | Mechanism | Empirical signal |\n|------|-----------|------------------|\n| **A. Tenants stay longer** | Because moving would mean losing a rent that is *well below market* and because finding a comparable unit is hard, renters have a strong *incentive to remain* (sometimes for decades). | **Turnover rates** for rent\u2011controlled units in San\u202fFrancisco: **\u2248\u202f1\u202f%\u202fyr\u207b\u00b9** (vs. \u2248\u202f4\u202f%\u202fyr\u207b\u00b9 for uncontrolled units). |\n| **B. Landlords avoid \u201cre\u2011letting\u201d** | If a landlord does manage to evict a tenant (e.g., for non\u2011payment), the unit will re\u2011enter the market at a *capped* rent that is far below what the landlord could earn on a new market\u2011rate unit. | **Vacancy\u2011rate gap** (2020): 1.2\u202f% for rent\u2011controlled units vs. 7\u20139\u202f% for market units in the same neighbourhood. |\n| **C. \u201cHolding\u2011cost\u201d of a vacant unit rises** | A vacant unit still incurs property\u2011tax, insurance, utilities, and maintenance costs, but generates *no rent*. In a rent\u2011controlled market the *opportunity cost* of a vacancy is especially high because the landlord cannot quickly switch to a higher\u2011priced market rent. | **Landlord surveys** (e.g., *San\u202fFrancisco Tenants Union, 2019*) report that \u201cthe cost of a month\u2011long vacancy is equivalent to 2\u20133 months of market rent.\u201d |\n| **D. Supply of \u201cnew\u201d rent\u2011controlled units shrinks** | Developers anticipate that any unit they build (or convert) that falls under the control ceiling will earn a *lower long\u2011run return*. Hence they **build fewer rental units** or **convert to condos/co\u2011ops** that are exempt. | **Housing\u2011stock growth** (1990\u20112020): total rental units +7\u202f% vs. market\u2011rate units +30\u202f% (most of the growth came from post\u20111995, uncontrolled units). |\n\nPutting A\u2013D together, the *observable vacancy rate* for rent\u2011controlled units stays **very low (1\u20112\u202f% on average)** even when the",
