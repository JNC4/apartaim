The immune system makes antibodies, usually needing boosters to maintain protection. | Polio (IPV), hepatitis A |\n| **Subunit / protein\u2011based** | Only specific proteins (or polysaccharides) from the pathogen, sometimes linked to a carrier protein | The immune system sees the key \u201ctarget\u2019\u2019 antigen(s) and makes antibodies.

Injection** | A few hundred microlitres of liquid containing **lipid\u2011nanoparticle (LNP)\u2011encapsulated messenger RNA** is delivered into the muscle (usually the deltoid). The LNP protects the fragile mRNA from degradation and helps it fuse with nearby cells. | The LNPs are **non\u2011viral** and are cleared from the injection site within days. They do not contain any live or replicating material. |\n| **b. Cellular uptake** | Muscle cells and local antigen\u2011presenting cells (dendritic cells) take up the LNPs by endocytosis. | The mRNA never enters the cell nucleus, so it **cannot integrate into DNA**. |\n| **c. Translation** | Inside the cytoplasm, ribosomes read the mRNA code and produce a single viral protein \u2013 for the COVID\u201119 vaccines this is the **prefusion\u2011stabilized spike protein** of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. The protein is expressed for a few hours to a couple of days and is then degraded. | The protein is **non\u2011infectious** (there is no whole virus) and is presented on the cell surface or released in tiny amounts, giving the immune system a \u201cpreview\u2019\u2019 of the virus. |\n| **d. Immune priming** | Dendritic cells display fragments of the spike protein on MHC molecules, travel to lymph nodes, and activate: <br>\u2022 **B\u2011cells** \u2192 make spike\u2011specific antibodies (IgM \u2192 IgG). <br>\u2022 **CD4\u207a helper T\u2011cells** \u2192 aid B\u2011cells and help shape the response. <br>\u2022 **CD8\u207a cytotoxic T\u2011cells** (especially with mRNA) \u2192 can kill cells that later display the spike protein. | The response is **targeted** (only to the spike protein) and mimics what would happen after a natural infection, but **without the virus replicating** or causing disease. |\n| **e. Memory formation** | Some B\u2011 and T\u2011cells become long\u2011lived memory cells, ready to react quickly if the child later encounters the real virus. | This memory is the basis for long\u2011term protection; it is the same principle used by all approved vaccines. |\n\n### Key technical points that address the most common safety questions  \n\n| Question | Evidence\u2011based answer |\n|----------|-----------------------|\n| **Does the mRNA change my child\u2019s DNA?** | No. mRNA works in the **cytoplasm** and is degraded by normal cellular enzymes within 24\u201148\u202fh.

      "unknown_model_response": "### How mRNA Vaccines Work  \n\n1. **The basic principle**  \n   - An mRNA vaccine contains a short piece of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the spike protein of the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 virus (the protein the virus uses to attach to human cells).  \n   - The mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, which protect the fragile molecule and help it enter cells after the injection.\n\n2. **What happens after the shot**  \n   - Once the lipid particles deliver the mRNA into muscle cells near the injection site, the cells\u2019 own ribosomes read the mRNA instructions and produce a tiny, harmless fragment of the spike protein.  \n   - This spike protein fragment is displayed on the surface of the cell, where the immune system can \u201csee\u201d it.\n\n3. **Immune activation**  \n   - The immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign and mounts a response:  \n     * **Antibodies** are generated that can bind to the spike protein and neutralize the actual virus if the child is later exposed.  \n     * **T\u2011cell responses** are also stimulated, providing longer\u2011term cellular immunity.  \n   - After a few days to weeks, the mRNA is degraded by normal cellular processes and the spike protein fragments are cleared. The mRNA never enters the cell nucleus, so it cannot interact with or alter the child\u2019s DNA.\n\n### Safety Profile in Children  \n\n| Age Group (U.S. FDA/CDC approvals) | Vaccine (e.g., Pfizer\u2011BNT162b2) | Common Side Effects (usually mild) | Rare but Reported Serious Events |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 6 months \u2013 4 years                | Pfizer (3\u2011dose series)        | Soreness at injection site, fatigue, fever, headache, muscle aches | Myocarditis/pericarditis (\u22481\u20135 cases per 100,000 doses, most mild and resolve with rest), anaphylaxis (\u22482\u20135 per million doses) |\n| 5 \u2013 11 years                      | Pfizer (2\u2011dose series)        | Similar to above; fever and chills slightly less frequent than in adolescents | Same rare myocarditis/pericarditis pattern, slightly lower incidence than in teens |\n| 12 \u2013 17 years                     | Pfizer, Moderna (2\u2011dose series) | Soreness, fatigue, headache, fever, chills | Myocarditis/pericarditis (higher incidence in males 12\u201129, about 10\u201315 per 100,000 after second dose) |\n\n**Key points from large\u2011scale safety monitoring**  \n\n- **Clinical trial data**: Trials involving tens of thousands of children demonstrated that the vaccine\u2019s efficacy in preventing COVID\u201119 infection and severe disease is comparable to that seen in adults, while the rate of serious adverse events was extremely low.  \n- **Post\u2011marketing surveillance**: Systems such as the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), and the UK\u2019s Yellow Card scheme have continued to monitor safety. To date, the data show that serious adverse events remain exceedingly rare and that the benefits\u2014preventing COVID\u201119\u2013related hospitalizations, MIS\u2011C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children), and long\u2011COVID\u2014far outweigh the risks.  \n- **Long\u2011term safety**: mRNA does not integrate into the genome and is rapidly broken down. No biologically plausible mechanism exists for the vaccine to cause genetic damage or chronic disease. Long\u2011term follow\u2011up (up to 2\u202fyears) of trial participants has not identified any late\u2011emerging safety concerns.\n\n### Why Health Authorities Consider Them Safe for Kids  \n\n1. **Rigorous testing** \u2013 Before approval, the vaccines underwent Phase\u202f1/2 dose\u2011finding studies, followed by large Phase\u202f3",
