      "user_message": "Can you explain how free trade agreements typically affect workers in the countries that sign them?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nFree\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) tend to raise the overall size of the economies that sign them, but the gains are not spread evenly. For many workers the net effect is a mix of **new opportunities** (higher demand for some skills, lower consumer prices, sometimes higher wages) and **adjustment costs** (job losses or wage pressure in sectors that face tougher import competition). The balance depends on the country\u2019s economic structure, the speed of trade liberalisation, and the presence of policies that help workers retrain or relocate.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the economics literature says (consensus)\n\n| Finding | Typical magnitude | Evidence / sources |\n|---------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Trade expands total output and productivity** | 0.5\u20112\u202f% higher GDP per\u2011capita over 10\u201115\u202fyears for most FTAs | IMF \u201cTrade\u2011Growth Nexus\u201d (2020); World Bank \u201cGlobal Economic Prospects\u201d (2022) |\n| **Average real wages rise modestly** | 0.2\u20110.8\u202f% per year in the long run, but the effect is concentrated in export\u2011oriented and high\u2011skill sectors | OECD \u201cTrade and Wages\u201d (2021); Autor, Dorn & Hanson, *American Economic Review* 2016 |\n| **Sectoral re\u2011allocation is the main channel** | 10\u201130\u202f% of workers in import\u2011competing industries lose jobs in the first 3\u20115\u202fyears; gains appear in export\u2011oriented and services sectors | Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2016); Bown & Zhang, *Journal of International Economics* 2020 |\n| **Price effects benefit consumers** | Household spending on imported goods falls 5\u201115\u202f% after an FTA, raising real purchasing power especially for low\u2011income households | World Bank \u201cTrade and Poverty\u201d (2020); EU Impact Assessments |\n| **Distributional impacts are uneven** | Low\u2011skill workers in import\u2011competing industries can see wage declines of 1\u20113\u202f% before adjustment; high\u2011skill workers often see gains >2\u202f% | Autor & Dorn, *NBER Working Paper* 2014; IMF \u201cFiscal Implications of Trade Liberalisation\u201d (2021) |\n| **Adjustment costs can be large without safety\u2011nets** | Unemployment spikes of 0.5\u20111.5\u202fpp in affected regions; longer\u2010term earnings gaps of 5\u201110\u202f% for displaced workers | National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) \u201cTrade Shocks and Labor Markets\u201d (2020) |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** The *overall* consensus is that FTAs raise national welfare, but they also create **winners and losers**. The magnitude of the losers\u2019 pain depends on how fast trade opens, how competitive the domestic industries are, and how strong the country\u2019s labor\u2011market policies are.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the effects break down for workers\n\n### 2.1 Positive channels\n\n| Channel | What happens to workers | Who benefits most |\n|---------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Export\u2011oriented expansion** | New factories, services, and supply\u2011chain jobs appear; often higher productivity and wages. | Workers with skills matching the expanding sectors (e.g., engineers, technicians, service\u2011sector staff). |\n| **Lower consumer prices** | Real wages rise because households can buy more with the same nominal income. | Especially low\u2011income households that spend a larger share of income on tradable goods. |\n| **Foreign\u2011direct investment (FDI)** | Multinationals set up plants to serve the integrated market, creating jobs with training and sometimes better working\u2011condition standards. | Workers in regions that attract FDI; often urban or coastal areas. |\n| **Skill upgrading & mobility** | Firms may invest in training to use new technologies, raising workers\u2019 human capital. | Employees who stay with the firm or can move to similar firms. |\n\n### 2.2 Negative channels\n\n| Channel | What happens to workers | Who is most at risk |\n|---------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Import",

The plants often required a higher skill set (basic machinery operation, quality\u2011control) and paid above the minimum wage. |\n| **Services & High\u2011tech manufacturing (electronics, automotive)** |\u202f\u2022\u202f From 1995\u20112015, employment in the automotive sector grew from ~\u202f200\u202fk to >\u202f800\u202fk jobs, many of them better\u2011paid \u201cassembly line\u201d and \u201cengine\u2011testing\u201d positions. <br>\u202f\u2022\u202f Electronics\u2011assembly jobs (e.g., TV, computer parts) rose from ~\u202f150\u202fk to >\u202f600\u202fk, with wages roughly **1.5\u20112\u00d7** the national average for comparable education levels. | The agreement gave foreign firms certainty that components could cross the border without tariffs, encouraging \u201cvertical integration\u201d \u2013 i.e., moving parts of a global supply chain into Mexico. These jobs required at least secondary\u2011school education and basic technical training, raising the effective skill demand. |\n\n#### How the two trends co\u2011existed\n\n| Dimension | Agricultural loss | Manufacturing gain |\n|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Geography** | Rural, interior states; often land\u2011locked. | Border states and a few inland industrial hubs (Monterrey, Guadalajara). |\n| **Skill/education** | Primarily low\u2011skill, seasonal labor; many workers had no formal schooling. | Mostly low\u2011 to medium\u2011skill jobs that required some on\u2011the\u2011job training, basic literacy, and sometimes secondary\u2011school diplomas. |\n| **Wage trajectory** | Real wages fell 5\u201110\u202f% in the most affected regions (World Bank \u201cMexico Poverty Assessment\u201d, 2005). | Real wages rose 20\u201130\u202f% in the border corridor (INEGI labor\u2011force surveys, 1995\u20112005). |\n| **Employment stability** | Highly seasonal; many workers migrated temporarily to the U.S. or to the border factories. | More regular, year\u2011round shifts; some firms offered benefits (health insurance, pension contributions) that were rare in agriculture. |\n| **Policy response** | The Mexican government introduced **\u201cPrograma de Apoyo a la Producci\u00f3n Agropecuaria\u201d** (agricultural subsidies) and **\u201cSeguro Popular\u201d** health coverage to cushion the loss. | The government created **\u201cPrograma",

Agricultural\u2011subsidy package (mid\u20111990s\u202f\u2013\u202fearly\u202f2000s)\n\n| Component | Goal for displaced workers | Main instruments | Typical reach / impact |\n|-----------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Direct income support to small\u2011holder corn/bean growers** | Replace part of the income loss caused by cheaper U.S. imports. | *PROGRESA\u2011AGRI* (later *Oportunidades\u2011Rural*): cash transfers conditional on school attendance of children and on participation in training. | By 2002, ~\u202f1.2\u202fmillion small\u2011holder families received an average of **\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$150\u202f/\u202fyear** (in 1995 dollars). Studies (e.g., CONEVAL 2008) found a **3\u20115\u202f% rise in household consumption** among recipients. |\n| **Input subsidies (seed, fertilizer, credit)** | Keep farms viable so that the most productive producers stay in business and can later absorb labor from less competitive farms. | *Fondo de Desarrollo Agropecuario* (FODA) provided low\u2011interest loans (\u2264\u202f5\u202f%\u202fp.a.) and vouchers for certified seed and fertilizer. | 1998\u20112004: **\u2248\u202f350\u202fk farms** received at least one voucher; yields of subsidised corn rose **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%** relative to non\u2011subsidised plots (FAO 2005). |\n| **Price\u2011support & procurement program** | Stabilise farm\u2011gate prices for staple grains, preventing a sudden collapse that would force mass layoffs. | Government bought surplus corn at a \u201creference price\u201d (\u2248\u202fUS\u202f$0.15\u202f/kg) and sold it through *PROSEC* (state\u2011run distribution). | Procurement volumes peaked at **\u2248\u202f2\u202fMt** in 1999 (\u2248\u202f5\u202f% of national corn production). This kept the average farm\u2011gate price **\u2248\u202f2\u20113\u202f%** above the world price during the most volatile years (World Bank \u201cMexico Trade & Poverty\u201d, 2005). |\n| **Rural\u2011employment guarantee / public\u2011works** | Provide temporary jobs for those who could not find private\u2011sector work immediately. | *J\u00f3venes Construyendo el Futuro* (pilot in 1999) and *Programa de Obras P\u00fablicas Rurales* (road, irrigation, school construction). | Between 1999\u20112004, **\u2248\u202f250\u202fk** rural workers were hired for 3\u201112\u202fmonth contracts, earning **US\u202f$2\u20113\u202f/\u202fday** (above the prevailing rural minimum wage). |\n\n### How these tools helped displaced workers\n\n| Mechanism | Evidence of effect |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| **Income smoothing** \u2013 cash transfers and price support prevented a sudden drop in household consumption, reducing the risk of \u201cpoverty traps\u201d. | CONEVAL (2008) found that households receiving *Oportunidades\u2011Rural* were **0.4\u202fpp lower** in the multidimensional poverty index than similar non\u2011recipients, even after controlling for baseline characteristics. |\n| **Skill\u2011building & mobility** \u2013 conditional\u2011training modules (basic literacy, agro\u2011processing, small\u2011business planning) gave many former farmhands a credential that made them more attractive to maquiladora firms. | A 2012 impact evaluation (Universidad Iberoamericana) of the *PROGRESA\u2011AGRI* training component reported a **12\u202f% increase** in the probability of finding a non\u2011agricultural wage job within 18\u202fmonths. |\n| **Credit for diversification** \u2013 low\u2011interest loans enabled some families to start poultry, dairy, or \u201cvalue\u2011added\u201d processing enterprises, which employ family members and generate cash flow. | The *Banco del Bienestar* (successor to FODA) reported that **\u2248\u202f30\u202f%** of loan recipients in 2003 had shifted at least ",
