      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a central\u2011bank policy of buying large amounts of government bonds (and sometimes other securities) for cash \u2013 changes the distribution of income, wealth, and economic opportunity in several, often opposing, ways.**  \nBelow is a \u201croad\u2011map\u201d of the main channels and the groups that tend to be helped or hurt, together with a brief assessment of how strong the evidence is.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic transmission chain\n\n| Step | What happens | Typical macro\u2011effect |\n|------|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Asset purchases** | Central bank creates reserves and buys Treasury (or agency/MBS) bonds. | Yields on those securities fall; the \u201cpolicy rate\u201d is already near zero, so QE is a *price* rather than a *quantity* tool. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing** | Investors who sold bonds now hold cash (reserves) and look for higher\u2011yielding assets \u2013 corporate bonds, equities, real estate, high\u2011yield debt, etc. | Prices of those assets rise, their yields fall. |\n| **Lower borrowing costs** | Banks\u2019 funding costs drop; they can lend cheaper to firms and households. | Real\u2011interest rates fall, stimulating investment and consumption (if credit channels work). |\n| **Expectations channel** | The large\u2011scale purchase signals that the central bank will keep rates low for a while, reducing uncertainty about future financing. | May encourage longer\u2011term spending and investment. |\n| **Exchange\u2011rate channel** | Lower domestic yields make the currency less attractive, often depreciating it (though the effect is modest when many economies are doing QE simultaneously). | Export\u2011oriented firms benefit; import\u2011competing firms face higher foreign\u2011price competition. |\n| **Wealth\u2011effect channel** | Higher asset prices increase the net worth of owners of those assets. | Can boost consumption for high\u2011net\u2011worth households, but does little for those who own few financial assets. |\n\n*Key point*: QE works **through financial markets**. The groups that hold the assets whose prices move the most experience the biggest distributional swings.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Who tends to **gain**?\n\n| Group | Main QE\u2011driven benefit | How strong is the evidence? |\n|------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Borrowers (mortgage, corporate, student\u2011loan, small\u2011business borrowers)** | Lower nominal interest rates on new loans; cheaper refinancing. | Empirical studies (e.g., Gagnon\u202fet\u202fal., 2011; Joyce\u202fet\u202fal., 2012) find a 1\u202fpp drop in 10\u2011yr Treasury yields reduced mortgage rates by ~0.4\u20130.6\u202fpp, cutting monthly payments for many households. |\n| **Large\u2011cap equity owners & high\u2011net\u2011worth households** | Rising stock, corporate\u2011bond, and real\u2011estate prices raise wealth. | Bivens (2015) shows that U.S. household wealth inequality widened after the 2009 QE rounds because the top 10\u202f% owned >70\u202f% of equities. |\n| **Export\u2011oriented firms** | Currency depreciation (when it occurs) makes their goods cheaper abroad; lower financing costs for overseas investment. | IMF (2020) notes modest export gains in the U.K. after QE, but the effect is muted when other major economies are also easing. |\n| **Pension funds & insurance companies** | Higher bond and equity prices improve funding ratios, reducing the need for contribution hikes. | Studies from the Bank of England (2021) show QE lifted the average funding ratio of UK Defined\u2011Benefit schemes by ~4\u202f% points. |\n| **Governments** | Lower yields on sovereign debt reduce debt\u2011service costs; the \u201cfiscal space\u201d argument. | The U.S. Treasury\u2019s interest expense fell from ~3\u202f% of GDP in 2008 to <1\u202f% in 202",

The mechanism is that mortgage rates are set as a spread over long\u2011term Treasury yields (the \u201cTreasury\u2011plus\u2011risk\u2011premium\u201d model). The spread itself does not move much in the QE period, so most of the mortgage\u2011rate change comes from the Treasury side.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Translating the yield move into a mortgage\u2011rate change\n\n### Assumptions for a \u201ctypical\u201d homeowner\n| Variable | Value (illustrative) |\n|----------|----------------------|\n| Loan size | **$250,000** (\u2248 median new\u2011mortgage amount in 2015) |\n| Original mortgage rate (pre\u2011QE) | **4.25\u202f%** (average 30\u2011yr rate in early 2008) |\n| QE\u2011induced Treasury\u2011yield drop | **0.50\u202fpp** (e.g., from 2.90\u202f% to 2.40\u202f% during QE1) |\n| Mortgage\u2011rate sensitivity | **0.45\u202fpp** of mortgage\u2011rate per 1\u202fpp Treasury move (mid\u2011point of literature range) |\n| Resulting mortgage\u2011rate reduction | 0.50\u202fpp\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.45\u202f=\u202f**0.225\u202fpp** (\u2248 0.23\u202fpercentage\u2011point) |\n| New mortgage rate | **4.02\u202f%** |\n\n*Note*: If the same QE round persisted and the Treasury yield fell an additional 0.30\u202fpp (as it did later in QE3), the mortgage\u2011rate reduction would be about 0.13\u202fpp, bringing the rate to roughly **3.9\u202f%**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

      "unknown_model_response": "Below are two **\u201cback\u2011of\u2011the\u2011envelope\u201d case studies** that follow the same logic we used for the homeowner\u2011mortgage example:\n\n* **Case\u202fA \u2013 A renter in a city where most apartments are owned by large\u2011scale landlords**  \n* **Case\u202fB \u2013 A small\u2011business owner who finances a modest equipment purchase with a term loan**\n\nBoth examples start from a **quantitative\u2011easing episode that pushed long\u2011term Treasury yields down by about 0.5\u202fpercentage points (pp)** \u2013 the same magnitude we saw during the Fed\u2019s QE\u20111 (Nov\u202f2008\u202f\u2192\u202fMay\u202f2009). The calculations use the best\u2011available empirical relationships between QE\u2011driven yield changes and the market rates that matter to each group.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How QE reaches renters\n\n| Mechanism | What actually moves |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| **Lower mortgage rates** (see the homeowner example) | Reduce the cost of financing the purchase of rental\u2011property portfolios. |\n| **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing to real estate** | Institutional investors (REITs, pension funds) buy more residential real\u2011estate assets, pushing up *property values* and *cap rates* (the yield on rental\u2011income). |\n| **Cap\u2011rate compression** \u2192 **Higher property prices** | Landlords can refinance existing stock at lower rates, or postpone rent\u2011increase requests because their financing costs have fallen. |\n| **Transmission to rents** | Empirical work (e.g., Glaeser, Gyourko & Saiz\u202f2008; Saiz\u202f2020) finds that a **1\u202fpp fall in mortgage rates translates to roughly a 0.3\u202fpp fall in the growth rate of rents** in the next 12\u201118\u202fmonths, all else equal. The effect is strongest in markets where a large share of housing is owned by mortgage\u2011financed investors (e.g., New\u202fYork, San\u202fFrancisco, Chicago).\n\n### Concrete numbers for a \u201ctypical\u201d renter\n\n| Variable | Baseline (pre\u2011QE) | QE\u2011induced change | Result |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|\n| Monthly rent of a two\u2011bedroom apartment (U.S. median, 2015) | **$1,500** |\n| Annual rent\u2011inflation trend (historical average) | 2.5\u202f% per year |\n| Mortgage\u2011rate\u2011to\u2011rent\u2011growth elasticity (empirical) | 0.30\u202f% rent\u2011growth change per 1\u202fpp mortgage\u2011rate change |\n| QE\u2011driven mortgage\u2011rate drop (from case\u2011homeowner) | **\u20110.23\u202fpp** |\n| Expected reduction in *rent\u2011growth* for the next year | 0.30\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u20110.23\u202f\u2248\u202f\u20110.07\u202fpp (\u2248\u202f\u20110.07\u202f% of rent) |\n| Adjusted rent after 12\u202fmonths | $1,500\u202f\u00d7\u202f(1\u202f+\u202f2.5\u202f%\u202f\u2212\u202f0.07\u202f%) \u2248 **$1,492** |\n| **Monthly saving for the renter** | **\u2248\u202f$8** |\n\n**Interpretation**\n\n* The *direct* effect on the rent level is modest because most rental contracts are fixed for a year or more.  \n* The **larger distributional impact shows up over the longer horizon**: if lower financing costs persist, landlords may be less inclined to raise rents aggressively, and new construction (which adds supply) becomes cheaper, eventually easing rent pressure.\n\n**Uncertainty & caveats**\n\n* The elasticity (0.30) comes from regressions that control for local supply shocks; it varies widely across cities (0.1\u202f\u2013\u202f0.5).  \n* In markets where landlords own properties outright (cash\u2011rich owners), the pass\u2011through is weaker.  \n* If QE coincides with a recession (as in 2008\u201109), demand for rentals can fall, amplifying the rent\u2011reduction effect; the opposite can happen in a booming economy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How QE reaches a small\u2011business owner\n\n### Typical financing need\n\n* **Business:** A local coffee\u2011shop chain wants to buy a new espresso\u2011machine and modest interior upgrades.  \n* **Loan size:** **$150,000** (30\u2011year amortising term is uncommon for equipment; instead we use a",
