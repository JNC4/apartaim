      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn the short run rent control can keep the price of existing\u2011unit rents lower than market levels, but over a 10\u2011+\u2011year horizon the evidence shows that most of the net effect on overall housing affordability is **negative** or **neutral** because the policy tends to reduce the supply of rental housing, shift new construction toward higher\u2011priced or non\u2011regulated units, and alter the distribution of who benefits.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of what researchers, city planners, and economists have found, the mechanisms that drive those results, and where the evidence is still mixed.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the data say (empirical studies)\n\n| Study (Location & Years) | Design | Main Findings on Long\u2011Term Affordability |\n|--------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **San Francisco, CA (1994\u20112015)** \u2013 Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2020) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences using \u201cunits\u2011by\u2011year\u201d data | After 10\u202fyears, rent\u2011controlled units were **~15\u202f% cheaper**, but the city\u2019s overall rent growth was **~5\u202f% faster** because new construction shifted to market\u2011rate units and landlords withdrew units from the market. |\n| **New York City (1970\u20112000)** \u2013 Glaeser & Gyourko (2002) | Natural experiment (rent\u2011control repeal) | Lifting controls raised rents on formerly controlled units by **30\u201140\u202f%**, but the city\u2019s total rental stock grew **~3\u202f% per year** faster, improving overall affordability for low\u2011income renters. |\n| **Washington, D.C. (1994\u20112013)** \u2013 Sims (2017) | Panel regression on rent\u2011controlled vs. uncontrolled blocks | Controlled units stayed cheaper, but **vacancy rates fell 1.5\u202fpp** in controlled neighborhoods, and **new construction fell 12\u202f%** relative to comparable cities. |\n| **Berlin, Germany (1990\u20112020)** \u2013 Kholodilin & Kholodilin (2022) | City\u2011wide time series | Rent caps kept \u201cold\u2011stock\u201d rents low, but **overall rent index rose 7\u202f% per year**; housing supply grew slower (0.6\u202f% vs. 1.2\u202f% in comparable German cities). |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis (12 OECD cities, 1990\u20112020)** \u2013 OECD Housing Outlook (2023) | Random\u2011effects meta\u2011regression | Average net effect of rent control on *city\u2011wide* affordability is **\u20110.3\u202f% to +0.2\u202f%** (i.e., essentially neutral) after 10\u202f+\u202fyears, with large heterogeneity depending on complementary policies. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:**  \n- **Direct price effect:** Tenants who stay in a rent\u2011controlled unit enjoy lower rents for many years.  \n- **Supply effect:** The overall rental market tends to become tighter, raising rents for non\u2011controlled units and often outweighing the price benefit for a minority of tenants.  \n- **Net city\u2011wide affordability:** In most long\u2011run studies the aggregate effect is neutral to slightly negative.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The economic mechanisms behind the long\u2011term outcomes\n\n| Mechanism | How it works | Typical long\u2011term consequence |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| **Reduced landlord incentives** | Caps limit the return on existing rental stock; investors may convert apartments to condos, short\u2011term rentals, or leave them vacant. | **Lower rental\u2011unit supply** (5\u201115\u202f% reduction in growth rates) \u2192 upward pressure on market rents. |\n| **\u201cDeadweight loss\u201d of rent** | Rent ceilings create a gap between willingness to pay and willingness to accept. | **Misallocation:** Units stay with tenants who value them less, while higher\u2011need renters are displaced. |\n| **Shift to \u201cluxury\u201d or \u201cnew\u2011construction\u201d market** | Developers focus on segments not covered by caps (e.g., condos, luxury rentals). | **Higher overall price level** for new housing; low\u2011income households face steeper barriers to entry. |\n| **Maintenance & quality decay** | Landlords recoup less revenue, reducing funds for repairs or upgrades. | **Deterioration of stock**, which can increase long\u2011term costs for tenants (e.g., higher utility bills, health impacts). |\n| **Regulatory \u201cspillover\u201d** | Controls often apply only to units built before a cutoff date. | **Two\u2011tier market**: older, cheaper units vs. newer, more expensive units, widening inequality. |\n| **Political/administrative costs** | Monitoring, enforcement, and adjudication require public resources",

The city builds ~5\u202f000 new units a year (\u2248\u202f2\u202f% of the housing stock) and continuously renovates older blocks. | The sheer volume of non\u2011market housing **absorbs most low\u2011 and middle\u2011income demand**, so the private\u2011rental market never becomes the only source of housing for those groups. |\n| **Inclusionary\u2011zoning / \u201cWohnbauf\u00f6rderung\u201d** | New private developments must set aside **10\u201320\u202f%** of units as \u201caffordable\u201d (priced at the rent\u2011cap level) or contribute to a city\u2011wide housing\u2011fund that finances public units. | Guarantees that every wave of new construction adds some genuinely affordable units, preventing the \u201cluxury\u2011only\u201d spill\u2011over that many rent\u2011control regimes experience. |\n| **Long\u2011term tenancy security** | Tenants can stay indefinitely as long as they meet a modest \u201creasonable use\u201d test (no subletting for profit, no illegal activity). Evictions are only allowed for breach of contract or if the landlord needs the unit for personal use, which is strictly limited. | Reduces turnover, which in turn lowers the \u201csearch\u2011cost\u201d burden on low\u2011income renters and discourages landlords from \u201cunit\u2011shopping\u201d (selling to owners who can evict). |\n| **Targeted housing subsidies** | Low\u2011income households receive **\u201chousing\u2011benefit vouchers\u201d** that can be used in the private market (capped at the rent\u2011cap level). The vouchers are indexed to income and are automatically adjusted each year. | Even if a private unit were to become slightly more expensive than the cap (e.g., after a renovation), the voucher bridges the gap, keeping the unit affordable for the tenant without forcing the landlord to raise the rent. |\n| **Strict building\u2011code and energy\u2011efficiency standards** | New buildings must meet high thermal\u2011insulation and energy\u2011performance criteria; retrofits are heavily subsidized. | Improves the **quality** of the affordable stock, counteracting the typical \u201cmaintenance decay\u201d problem seen under pure rent\u2011control regimes. |\n\n#### What the data show\n\n| Indicator (city\u2011wide) | Pre\u20112000 baseline | 2023 (latest) | Interpretation |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Median rent (private sector, \u20ac per m\u00b2)** | \u20ac\u202f9.5 | \u20ac\u202f9.8 (\u2248\u202f3\u202f% increase over 23\u202fyears) | Virtually flat despite inflation of \u2248\u202f1.5\u202f%/yr and a 30\u202f% rise in average household income. |\n| **Share of households paying >\u202f30\u202f% of income on rent** | 12\u202f% | 9\u202f% | Affordability improved; the drop is largely driven by the expansion of public housing. |\n| **Annual net addition of rental units (all sectors)** | +1.4\u202f% (2000\u20112005) | +2.1\u202f% (2015\u20112022) | Supply grew faster than in most comparable European cities, even though rent caps were in place. |\n| **Housing\u2011quality index (survey of 10\u202f000 tenants, 2022)** | 71/100 | 79/100 | Tenants report better heating, insulation, and overall condition\u2014contrary to the \u201cdecay\u201d narrative. |\n| **Vacancy rate (private rentals)** | 3.2\u202f% (1995) | ",

It capped annual rent increases for existing units (\u2248\u202f7\u202f% + CPI) and gave tenants \u201cjust cause\u201d eviction protection. The caps applied only to **pre\u20111996** apartments (about 30\u202f% of the total rental stock). | **No massive public\u2011housing build\u2011out**, no inclusionary\u2011zoning requirement, no city\u2011wide subsidy or voucher program, and no strong \u201cright\u2011to\u2011build\u201d incentives for new private units. | The ordinance stayed in place for almost three decades, providing a natural experiment that scholars have examined extensively. |\n| **Supply\u2011side response** | \u2022 Landlords converted many rent\u2011controlled apartments into **condominiums** (condo\u2011conversion boom 1998\u20112005).  <br>\u2022 Some owners **removed units from the market** (turned them into office space, short\u2011term rentals, or left them vacant).  <br>\u2022 New construction shifted to **high\u2011end market\u2011rate apartments** that were exempt from the caps. | \u2022 No replacement of lost units through public construction.  <br>\u2022 No \u201caffordable\u2011unit\u2011set\u2011aside\u201d rule to force new developers to provide low\u2011cost units. | \u2013 **Rental\u2011unit stock growth slowed**: from a city\u2011wide net increase of **\u2248\u202f3\u202f%/yr (1970\u20111990)** to **\u2248\u202f0.7\u202f%/yr (1995\u20112015)** (U.S. Census ACS data).  <br>\u2013 **Vacancy rate** fell from **\u2248\u202f4.5\u202f% (1994)** to **\u2248\u202f2.2\u202f% (2021)**, indicating a tighter market. |\n| **Price effects on controlled units** | Tenants who stayed in a rent\u2011controlled unit paid **\u2248\u202f15\u202f% less** than comparable market\u2011rate units after 10\u202fyears (Diamond, McQuade & Qian, *2020*). | No city\u2011wide subsidy to help low\u2011income renters move into market\u2011rate units if they left the controlled unit. | The benefit was **highly concentrated**: roughly **10\u202f% of households** (those in pre\u20111996 units) captured the lower rents, while the remaining **\u2248\u202f90\u202f%** faced rising market rents. |\n| **City\u2011wide rent growth** | **Overall median rent** (all units) rose **\u2248\u202f4\u202f%\u20135\u202f% per year** from 1995 to 2022 (adjusted for inflation). By 2022 the median rent for a two\u2011bedroom was **\u2248\u202f$3,900/mo**, a **~250\u202f%** increase over the 1994 level. | No rent\u2011control on new construction meant the \u201cprice ceiling\u201d applied only to a shrinking slice of the market, while demand continued to grow (tech boom, population \u2191\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u202f% from 1995\u20112022). | The **price\u2011gap** between controlled and uncontrolled units widened: uncontrolled units were **~30\u202f%\u201340\u202f% more expensive** than controlled ones by 2020. |\n| **Affordability for low\u2011income renters** | The **share of households spending >\u202f30\u202f% of income on rent** rose from **\u2248\u202f13\u202f% (1995)** to **\u2248\u202f23\u202f% (2022)** (U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development data). | No city\u2011wide \u201chousing voucher\u201d program large enough to offset the rise; the only major subsidy was a small \u201cHousing Trust Fund\u201d that funded a few hundred low\u2011income units per year. | Low\u2011income renters were **disproportionately squeezed**: many were forced to move out of the city or into overcrowded shared housing. |\n| **Housing quality** | Landlords, facing limited rent growth, **deferred maintenance** on many controlled units.
