      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nA large body of peer\u2011reviewed research, systematic reviews, and regulatory assessments\u2014covering tens of billions of meals consumed worldwide\u2014has found **no credible evidence that currently marketed genetically\u2011modified (GM) foods pose a health risk to humans**. At the same time, a few isolated studies have raised concerns, but most of those have methodological flaws, have not been replicated, or have been withdrawn. Because each GM product is evaluated individually, safety conclusions are \u201ccase\u2011by\u2011case\u201d rather than a blanket statement about the technology.\n\nBelow is a\u202fconcise, evidence\u2011based overview of the scientific record, the regulatory process, and the remaining uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
