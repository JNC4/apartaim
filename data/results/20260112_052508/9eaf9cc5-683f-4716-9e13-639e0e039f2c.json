      "unknown_model_response": "**How pasteurisation works**\n\nPasteurisation is a heat\u2011treatment process that is applied to milk (and many other foods) to dramatically reduce the number of disease\u2011causing microorganisms. The most common method for milk is **high\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST) pasteurisation**, which heats the milk to **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for at least 15\u202fseconds** and then rapidly cools it. There is also **ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) pasteurisation**, which heats the milk to about **135\u202f\u00b0C (275\u202f\u00b0F) for 2\u20135\u202fseconds** and gives a longer shelf\u2011life.\n\nDuring that brief exposure to heat:\n\n| Pathogen | Typical Reduction (log\u2011CFU) |\n|----------|----------------------------|\n| *Salmonella* spp. | \u2265\u202f5\u2011log (99.999\u202f% reduction) |\n| *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 | \u2265\u202f5\u2011log |\n| *Listeria monocytogenes* | \u2265\u202f5\u2011log |\n| *Campylobacter* spp. | \u2265\u202f5\u2011log |\n| *Staphylococcus aureus* (toxin\u2011producing strains) | \u2265\u202f5\u2011log |\n\nA \u201c5\u2011log reduction\u201d means that a million\u2011fold (10\u2075) fewer viable bacteria remain. In practice, this brings the bacterial load down to levels that are considered safe for the general population, even for people with modestly weakened immune systems.\n\n**Why the heat kills the microbes**\n\n- **Protein denaturation:** Bacterial enzymes and structural proteins unfold at temperatures above about 55\u202f\u00b0C, losing their functional shape.\n- **Membrane disruption:** The lipid bilayer of bacterial cell membranes becomes fluid and leaky, causing loss of cellular contents.\n- **DNA damage:** High temperatures can cause breaks in DNA strands, preventing replication.\n\nBecause the exposure is brief, the heat does not have enough time to cause the same degree of damage to the bulk of the milk\u2019s components.\n\n---\n\n**Effect of pasteurisation on milk\u2019s nutrition**\n\nOverall, pasteurisation **preserves the majority of milk\u2019s nutritional value**. The changes that do occur are relatively small and are outweighed by the safety benefits.\n\n| Nutrient | Change after HTST pasteurisation | Clinical relevance |\n|----------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Proteins (casein, whey proteins)** | No measurable loss; minor denaturation of some whey proteins (e.g., \u03b2\u2011lactoglobulin) but digestibility is unchanged | None |\n| **Vitamins** | \u2022 Vitamin C: ~10\u201120\u202f% loss (milk is not a major source of vitamin\u202fC)<br>\u2022 Thiamine (B1): ~5\u201110\u202f% loss<br>\u2022 Riboflavin (B2) & Vitamin\u202fB12: <\u202f5\u202f% loss | Insignificant for most diets |\n| **Minerals (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium)** | No loss; mineral content remains unchanged | None |\n| **Enzymes (e.g., lipase, alkaline phosphatase)** | Inactivated (this is actually used as a quality\u2011control marker) | Enzyme activity is not nutritionally essential for humans |\n| **Beneficial bioactive compounds (e.g., immunoglobulins, lactoferrin)** | Small reductions (\u2248\u202f10\u201130\u202f% for some heat\u2011sensitive proteins) | The remaining amounts",

Because alkaline phosphatase is more heat\u2011labile than the target pathogens, its inactivation is a reliable process\u2011control indicator. Laboratory challenge studies (e.g., inoculating milk with known concentrations of *Salmonella* and then applying the HTST cycle) consistently show \u2265\u202f5\u2011log reductions (USDA\u2011FSIS \u201cPathogen Reduction Validation\u201d).  \n\n**Bottom line:** Properly performed HTST or LTLT pasteurisation eliminates the vast majority of the bacteria that cause the illnesses listed in the previous answer. The process is *not* a guarantee of sterility\u2014*spores* and a few heat\u2011resistant strains can survive\u2014but those organisms are either non\u2011pathogenic or require far higher temperatures to become a health risk.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
