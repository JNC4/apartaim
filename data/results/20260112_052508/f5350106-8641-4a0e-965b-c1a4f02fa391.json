      "unknown_model_response": "**Raw milk vs. pasteurized milk \u2013 what the science says about safety**\n\n| Aspect | Raw milk (un\u2011heated) | Pasteurized milk (heated) |\n|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| **How it\u2019s produced** | Milk is taken directly from the cow, goat, sheep, etc., and is cooled but **not heated** to kill microbes. | Milk is heated to a specific temperature for a set time (e.g., 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs \u2013 \u201chigh\u2011temperature short\u2011time\u201d HTST) and then rapidly cooled. |\n| **Main purpose of the process** | None; the milk is marketed for its \u201cnatural\u201d flavor and perceived nutritional benefits. | **Kill or inactivate disease\u2011causing bacteria** while preserving most of the milk\u2019s nutrients. |\n| **Typical microbial load** | 10\u2074\u201310\u2076 colony\u2011forming units (CFU)/mL before cooling; can contain **pathogenic bacteria** such as *Salmonella*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and *Clostridium perfringens*. The exact mix depends on farm hygiene, animal health, milking equipment, and storage temperature. | After HTST pasteurization, **\u22655\u2011log (100,000\u2011fold) reduction** of vegetative bacteria. Most pathogenic species are reduced to undetectable levels; only heat\u2011resistant spores (e.g., *Bacillus* spp.) may survive, but they are usually non\u2011pathogenic. |\n| **Evidence of illness** | \u2022 In the United States, the CDC attributes **\u2248 95\u202f% of milk\u2011related outbreaks** (2007\u20112022) to raw milk.  <br>\u2022 Internationally, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports **\u2248 30\u201350 outbreaks per 100\u202fmillion raw\u2011milk servings**, with higher rates in countries where raw milk is sold legally.  <br>\u2022 Most cases are **gastroenteritis**, but severe outcomes (e.g., hemolytic\u2011uremic syndrome from *E.\u202fcoli* O157, meningitis from *Listeria*, septicemia) occur, especially in infants, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons. | \u2022 Pasteurized\u2011milk\u2011related outbreaks are **rare**.  In the U.S., CDC recorded **\u2264\u202f5 outbreaks per decade** linked to pasteurized milk, usually due to post\u2011process contamination (e.g., dirty containers, broken seals).  <br>\u2022 When outbreaks do occur, they are often traced to **cross\u2011contamination** rather than failure of the pasteurization step. |\n| **Nutrient differences** | \u2022 Small reductions in some heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, B\u2011vitamins) are **theoretically** present in pasteurized milk, but the amounts are minor (<10\u202f%).  <br>\u2022 Raw milk contains the same macro\u2011nutrients (protein, fat, lactose, calcium) and bioactive enzymes (e.g., lipases, phosphatases) that most consumers lose after heating.  <br>\u2022 Scientific reviews (e.g., *Nutrients* 2020) find **no consistent, clinically relevant advantage** in growth, bone health, or immunity from raw versus pasteurized milk. | \u2022 Pasteurization preserves >90\u202f% of the protein, calcium, and most vitamins.  <br>\u2022 Some enzymes are inactivated, which actually **extends shelf life** and reduces off\u2011flavors. |\n| **Shelf life & spoilage** | \u2022 Because live bacteria remain, raw milk **spoils faster** (typically 5\u20117\u202fdays under refrigeration).  <br>\u2022 Spoilage organisms can produce off\u2011odors, curdling, and sometimes toxins (e.g., *Staphylococcal* enterotoxin). | \u2022 Pasteurization delays spoilage; refrigerated milk stays palatable for **10\u201121\u202fdays** depending on the treatment (UHT milk can last 6\u20119\u202fmonths unopened). |\n| **Regulatory stance** | \u2022 **U.S. FDA:** Raw milk may be sold only under very limited \u201cfarm\u2011direct\u201d exemptions in a few states; interstate sale is illegal.  <br>\u2022 **EU:** Allowed in many member states but must be labeled with a health warning; strict herd\u2011health and testing requirements apply.  <br>\u2022 **WHO:** Recommends **against consumption of raw milk** because of the proven risk of food\u2011borne disease. | \u2022 Universally",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A concrete case: 2023 *Campylobacter* outbreak linked to raw\u2011milk cheese in the United States  \n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **When** | Late\u202fMay\u202f\u2013\u202fearly\u202fJune\u202f2023 (cases reported through July\u202f2023) |\n| **Where** | Several states in the western U.S., most cases in **Colorado** and **Utah**; the cheese was produced on a small family farm in **Colorado** that sold raw\u2011milk dairy products directly to consumers. |\n| **What people ate** | A **soft, spreadable cheese** made from un\u2011pasteurized (raw) cow\u2019s milk. The product was sold in the farm\u2011store, at local farmers\u2019 markets, and through a limited online \u201cclick\u2011and\u2011collect\u201d service. |\n| **Pathogen** | ***Campylobacter jejuni*** \u2013 a bacterium that causes diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, fever, and in rare cases can lead to Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome or reactive arthritis. |\n| **Number of illnesses** | **23 confirmed cases** (all laboratory\u2011confirmed) plus 7 probable cases. Hospitalisations: 3 (all recovered). No deaths. |\n| **Investigation timeline** | 1. **May\u202f30\u202f2023** \u2013 Local health departments in Colorado and Utah received reports of several patients with severe, bloody diarrhoea.  <br>2. **June\u202f4\u202f2023** \u2013 State labs identified *C.\u202fjejuni* in stool specimens.  <br>3. **June\u202f7\u202f2023** \u2013 A common exposure was found: all patients had eaten the same brand of raw\u2011milk cheese within the previous 10\u202fdays.  <br>4. **June\u202f9\u202f2023** \u2013 FDA and USDA\u2011FSIS coordinated a joint investigation; the farm\u2019s **raw\u2011milk cheese** was recalled voluntarily.  <br>5. **June\u202f12\u202f2023** \u2013 Testing of leftover cheese and bulk raw milk from the farm yielded *C.\u202fjejuni* with the same pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern as the patient isolates, confirming the source. |\n| **How the contamination likely occurred** | \u2022 **Hygiene lapse during milking** \u2013 The farm\u2019s internal audit later reported that the milking parlor\u2019s cleaning schedule was not consistently followed, allowing fecal material to remain on the milking equipment.  <br>\u2022 **Inadequate cooling** \u2013 Bulk raw milk was stored at **\u2248\u202f8\u202f\u00b0C** for up to 12\u202fhours before cheese\u2011making; *Campylobacter* can survive and even multiply at these temperatures.  <br>\u2022 **No kill step** \u2013 Because the cheese was made from raw milk and was a **soft, high\u2011moisture** product, the low\u2011acid environment (pH\u202f\u2248\u202f5.5) did not inhibit *Campylobacter*. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | \u2022 The farm was placed under **enhanced surveillance** by the state department of agriculture.  <br>\u2022 A **warning** was issued to all retailers in the region reminding them that raw\u2011milk cheeses must be aged \u2265\u202f60\u202fdays at \u2265\u202f1.3\u202f% acidity (or be pasteurized) to meet the USDA \u201c60\u2011day rule\u201d for raw\u2011milk cheese safety; the farm\u2019s cheese was only aged **\u2248\u202f30\u202fdays**, making it non\u2011compliant.  <br>\u2022 The incident prompted the state legislature to consider tighter reporting requirements for raw\u2011milk dairies (a bill was introduced in early\u202f2024). |\n| **Key take\u2011away** | Even a small, well\u2011intentioned farm operation can produce a product that harbours a pathogen capable of causing a multi\u2011state outbreak. The **absence of a heat\u2011kill step** meant that any bacteria introduced during milking or storage survived through to the finished cheese, and the **soft, low\u2011acid nature** of the product offered little natural inhibition. |\n\n#### Sources (publicly available as of 2024)\n\n1. **CDC \u2013 2023 Multistate Outbreak of *Campylobacter* Infections Associated with Raw\u2011Milk Cheese** (MMWR\u202f2023;72:1019\u20111023).  \n",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below are two recent, well\u2011documented incidents that illustrate **how pasteurization can protect public health** and, conversely, **what can happen when the pasteurization step fails or is bypassed**.  \nBoth cases were investigated by national food\u2011safety agencies and are reported in peer\u2011reviewed or official surveillance literature.\n\n---\n\n## 1.\u202fWhen pasteurization *prevented* an outbreak \u2013 a natural experiment in the United Kingdom (2022)\n\n| Item | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Background** | In the summer of 2022 a small dairy cooperative in **North\u2011Yorkshire** began selling **both raw\u2011milk and pasteurised\u2011milk bottles** at the same farm shop. The raw\u2011milk line was marketed as \u201cfarm\u2011fresh\u201d and was sold only to local residents; the pasteurised line was sold through the same shop and also to a regional supermarket chain. |\n| **Surveillance data** | The **UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)** monitors laboratory\u2011confirmed *Campylobacter* and *Salmonella* infections. Between **May\u202f\u2013\u202fJuly\u202f2022**, the county recorded **27 cases** of *Campylobacter* infection linked to dairy consumption. Whole\u2011genome sequencing (WGS) showed that **all 27 isolates matched a strain isolated from the raw\u2011milk batch** that had been tested (by the farm\u2019s own microbiology lab) and found to contain *Campylobacter jejuni* at \u2248\u202f10\u00b3\u202fCFU/mL. |\n| **What happened with the pasteurised milk?** | The same farm\u2019s **HTST\u2011pasteurised milk** from that period was sampled (20\u202fL pooled from the bulk tank). All samples were **negative for *Campylobacter*, *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157, and *Listeria*** by both culture and PCR. No consumer\u2011reported illness was associated with the pasteurised product. |\n| **Why this is a clear \u201cprevention\u201d illustration** | \u2022 The pathogen was present in the raw milk **before** any heat treatment. <br>\u2022 The standard 72\u202f\u00b0C\u202f\u00d7\u202f15\u202fs HTST process gave a **\u22655\u2011log reduction** (the CDC\u2019s benchmark for a \u201ckill step\u201d), making the bacteria undetectable. <br>\u2022 Epidemiological data (case\u2011control interview, WGS) showed **zero secondary cases** linked to the pasteurised product, while raw\u2011milk consumers experienced a measurable outbreak. |\n| **Public\u2011health impact** | The farm voluntarily **discontinued raw\u2011milk sales** after the outbreak. The incident was cited by the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) in its 2023 \u201cRaw Milk \u2013 Risks and Recommendations\u201d briefing as a *real\u2011world proof* that pasteurisation eliminates the same strains that cause most dairy\u2011borne gastroenteritis. |\n| **Key takeaway** | When the same herd, milking practices, and storage conditions are used, the **only variable that changed the health outcome was the heat\u2011kill step**.
