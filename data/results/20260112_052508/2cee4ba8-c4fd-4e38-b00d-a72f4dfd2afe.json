      "unknown_model_response": "**Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) and workers \u2013 a complete picture**\n\nBelow is a synthesis of the best\u2011available evidence, the main arguments that scholars and policymakers make on each side of the debate, the points on which most experts now agree, and the areas that remain contested.  The goal is to let you see the full range of findings so you can judge how FTAs are likely to affect workers in any particular country.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the data actually show (the \u201chard\u201d evidence)\n\n| Dimension | Typical short\u2011run effect | Typical long\u2011run effect | How strong the evidence is* |\n|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Overall employment** | Small, mixed impacts. In the first 2\u20115\u202fyears after an FTA, sectors that face new import competition (e.g., textiles in the U.S. after NAFTA) can lose jobs, while export\u2011oriented sectors (e.g., automotive parts in Mexico) gain jobs. | Net\u2011positive but modest. Meta\u2011analyses of 30\u2011plus studies (e.g., the OECD \u201cTrade and Employment\u201d series, 2021) find an average increase of **0.2\u20110.5\u202f% of total employment per 1\u202f% rise in trade intensity** after the adjustment period. | **High** \u2013 many country\u2011level case studies, panel regressions, and computable general\u2011equilibrium (CGE) models converge on a small positive aggregate effect. |\n| **Wages** | *Skill\u2011biased*: Low\u2011skill wages tend to stagnate or fall in regions that lose import\u2011competing jobs; high\u2011skill wages rise in export\u2011oriented or technologically intensive sectors. | In the long run, the wage gap between high\u2011skill and low\u2011skill workers often widens (by 10\u201130\u202f% in the OECD\u2019s 2022 \u201cSkills and Trade\u201d report). | **Medium\u2011high** \u2013 firm\u2011level micro\u2011data (e.g., US Census Bureau\u2019s LEHD, European Structure of Earnings Survey) provide clear patterns, but magnitude varies by labor\u2011market institutions. |\n| **Labor\u2011force participation & hours** | Small declines in participation for men in heavily exposed industries; modest increases for women in export\u2011oriented services (e.g., tourism in ASEAN). | Overall participation rates tend to converge to the pre\u2011FTA trend line after 5\u201110\u202fyears. | **Medium** \u2013 robust for participation, less precise for hour\u2011adjustments. |\n| **Job quality (benefits, security, health & safety)** | Mixed. Some FTAs include \u201clabor chapters\u201d that raise minimum\u2011wage or safety standards, but enforcement is often weak. In the absence of strong clauses, job quality can deteriorate in low\u2011wage sectors that expand. | Where strong labor\u2011rights enforcement is paired with trade (e.g., EU\u2011Canada CETA), job quality improves modestly over time. | **Low\u2011medium** \u2013 few long\u2011run studies; most evidence is anecdotal or from pilot\u2011program evaluations. |\n| **Sectoral reallocation** | Large\u2011scale shifts: manufacturing jobs move from high\u2011wage to low\u2011wage countries; services (finance, IT, tourism) expand in high\u2011skill economies. | The economy becomes more \u201ccomparative\u2011advantage\u2011aligned.\u201d The share of GDP from high\u2011value\u2011added sectors rises (e.g., Chile\u2019s export of copper and services grew 12\u202f% of GDP after its 1994 FTA). | **High** \u2013 sectoral trade\u2011flow data (UN COMTRADE, World Bank) are clear; the challenge is linking them to worker outcomes. |\n| **Inequality** | Short\u2011run spikes in regional and skill\u2011based inequality (e.g., U.S. \u201cRust Belt\u201d after NAFTA). | In most OECD cases, overall Gini coefficients fall slightly (0.1\u20110.3",

The agreement opened a **$30\u202fbillion market** for Chilean agricultural and processed\u2011food exporters and gave U.S. firms greater certainty to invest in Chilean manufacturing and services. | | |\n| **Observed wage effects** | \u2022 **Average nominal wages rose 4\u20115\u202f% faster** in the five years after the FTA (2005\u20112009) than in the previous decade, after controlling for inflation, productivity, and global commodity prices. <br>\u2022 The gain was **concentrated in the \u201cexport\u2011oriented\u201d manufacturing and services sectors** (e.g., fruit\u2011packing, salmon processing, logistics, call\u2011centers) that expanded because of U.S. demand. <br>\u2022 **Low\u2011skill workers** in those sectors saw **real wage gains of 2\u20113\u202f%**, while low\u2011skill workers in import\u2011competing sectors (e.g., basic textiles) experienced no statistically significant change. | **Source:** *\u201cThe Chile\u2011U.S. Free Trade Agreement: Labor Market Impacts\u201d* \u2013 World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 7931 (2015). <br>Method: Difference\u2011in\u2011differences using household survey data (CASEN) and matched control groups in comparable Latin\u2011American countries that did not sign FTAs at the same time. | The agreement **shifted production toward sectors that were already more skill\u2011intensive** and that faced higher U.S. standards (e.g., food\u2011safety), which forced firms to upgrade processes and pay better\u2011trained workers. |\n| **Observed job\u2011quality effects** | \u2022 **Formal\u2011employment rates** (i.e., contracts with social security, paid leave, and legally\u2011mandated benefits) rose **by about 2.5\u202fpercentage points** in the export\u2011oriented sectors. <br>\u2022 **Occupational\u2011health\u2011and\u2011safety (OHS) compliance** improved: the number of reported workplace accidents per 1,000 workers fell **\u2248\u202f12\u202f%** in those sectors, according to the Chilean Ministry of Labor\u2019s annual safety statistics. <br>\u2022 **Collective\u2011bargaining coverage** increased modestly (from 18\u202f% to 22\u202f% of workers) in the new export firms that adopted U.S.\u2011style labor\u2011relations to satisfy the FTA\u2019s \u201cfair\u2011trade\u201d reputation. | **Source:** *OECD \u201cTrade and Labour\u201d policy brief (2017)*; Chilean Ministry of Labor \u201cAnnual Workplace Safety Report\u201d (2004\u20112012). | The **Labor Chapter\u2019s monitoring mechanism** (the Joint Commission) prompted Chilean authorities to step up inspections, especially in export processing zones that wanted to maintain \u201cU.S. market access\u201d credibility. |\n| **Complementary reforms that amplified the effect** | \u2022 **Minimum\u2011wage indexation** to inflation (2005) \u2013 already in place, but the FTA gave political cover to raise it further. <br>\u2022 **Skills\u2011training subsidies** for export\u2011oriented firms (2006\u20112009) \u2013",
