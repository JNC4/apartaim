Safety monitoring systems, large\u2011scale epidemiologic studies, and decades of post\u2011licensure experience provide a robust picture of how safe modern vaccines are.

Those infected cells process viral proteins and display fragments (peptides) on **MHC** molecules. Dendritic cells travel to the nearest lymph node and present the peptides to na\u00efve T\u2011cells. | The same process occurs, but many **memory T\u2011cells** from the first dose are already stationed in those lymph nodes, so they respond faster and stronger. |\n| **b. Primary antibody response (IgM \u2192 IgG)** | **B\u2011cells** that recognise measles surface proteins (especially the hemagglutinin\u2011fusion (H\u2011F) glycoprotein) become activated. The first antibodies produced are **IgM**, detectable in the blood about 7\u201110\u202fdays after vaccination. Over the next 2\u20113\u202fweeks, class\u2011switching produces **IgG** antibodies that are more specific and have longer half\u2011life. Peak IgG titres appear ~3\u20114\u202fweeks after the first dose, but they are modest (often 1\u20112\u202flog lower than the titres seen after natural infection). | The second dose re\u2011stimulates those **memory B\u2011cells**. They rapidly differentiate into plasma cells that dump large amounts of **high\u2011affinity IgG**. The resulting antibody titre is usually **10\u201130\u202ftimes higher** than after the first dose and stays above the protective threshold (\u2248\u202f120\u202fmIU/mL) for many years. |\n| **c. Cellular immunity (CD4\u207a & CD8\u207a T\u2011cells)** | CD4\u207a \u201chelper\u201d T\u2011cells expand and secrete cytokines (IL\u20112, IFN\u2011\u03b3) that support B\u2011cell maturation. A modest CD8\u207a \u201ckiller\u201d T\u2011cell response is also generated, capable of destroying infected cells. This primary cellular response wanes over months. | Memory CD4\u207a and CD8\u207a T\u2011cells generated after dose\u202f1 expand much more quickly after dose\u202f2, producing a **stronger, more durable cytotoxic response**. This helps clear any real measles virus that might breach the antibody barrier. |\n| **d. Immunologic memory** | After the first dose, a pool of **memory B\u2011cells** (specific for measles H\u2011F protein) and **memory T\u2011cells** is established, but the numbers are relatively modest. If the child later encounters wild\u2011type measles, the immune system can respond, but the response may be slower and sometimes insufficient to prevent mild disease. | The second dose **\u201cboosts\u201d** the size and quality of the memory pool. Studies show a **3\u2011 to 5\u2011fold increase** in measles\u2011specific memory B\u2011cells and a higher proportion of high\u2011affinity antibodies. This makes it highly unlikely that a wild\u2011type infection will take hold\u2014most exposures are stopped at the mucosal surface by circulating IgG that diffuses into the respiratory tract. |\n| **e. Duration of protection** | One dose gives **\u2248\u202f85\u202f%** seroconversion (i.e., protective antibody level)",
