Outbreaks are documented in public\u2011health surveillance systems. | Very rare. When they occur, they are almost always linked to post\u2011pasteurisation contamination rather than the pasteurisation process itself. |\n| **Nutrient & enzyme claims** | Proponents argue that heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., B\u2011vitamins, vitamin C), enzymes (e.g., lactase, phosphatases), and \u201cbeneficial\u201d bacteria survive, potentially offering digestive or immunological benefits. | Most heat\u2011sensitive nutrients are only modestly reduced (e.g., <5\u202f% loss of B\u2011vitamins). Enzymes are largely inactivated, but the nutritional profile (protein, calcium, fat) remains essentially the same. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Shorter; spoilage can begin within days at refrigeration temperature. | Longer; HTST milk typically stays fresh for 2\u20133\u202fweeks under proper refrigeration. |\n| **Cost & availability** | Usually more expensive, limited to farms or specialty retailers. | Widely available, lower price due to economies of scale. |\n\nBelow is a deeper dive into the **safety** component of these differences, followed by a balanced presentation of the arguments on each side, the scientific consensus, and the reasons why the debate persists.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Some observational studies link raw\u2011milk consumption to lower rates of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and certain food allergies, but causality is unproven. | Mostly sterile; probiotic effects rely on added cultures (e.g., yogurt, kefir).  No known protective immune effect beyond what is provided by the nutrients themselves. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life / spoilage** | Shorter; rapid bacterial growth can lead to off\u2011flavors, curdling, and potential toxin production if kept >\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C for >\u202f24\u202fh. | Longer; the low bacterial load delays spoilage, allowing refrigeration for 2\u20113\u202fweeks (UHT even longer). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

If the milk had undergone **HTST pasteurisation**, the pathogen load would have been reduced from the millions of cells that were present to essentially zero, eliminating the exposure. |\n| **2012 \u2013 \u201cCalifornia cheese\u2011making\u201d outbreak** | A soft\u2011cheese producer used raw milk that was later found to contain *Listeria monocytogenes*. 31 people were infected, 6 of whom died. | The cheese\u2011making process (curd\u2011formation, low\u2011acid, short ripening) does not provide a lethal heat step. If the milk had first been pasteurised, the *Listeria* would have been removed before the cheese was even made, preventing the entire chain of contamination. |\n| **2015 \u2013 \u201cBritish infant\u2011formula\u201d scare** | A batch of infant formula made from **pasteurised** cow\u2011milk was recalled after a *Cronobacter sakazakii* contamination was detected **post\u2011pasteurisation** (during a later handling step).

If the same raw milk had been used, the product would have started with a high baseline of pathogens, dramatically increasing the chance of a serious outbreak. |\n\nThese three examples illustrate two points:\n\n1. **When raw milk is the source, disease follows** (Maine, California).  \n2. **When milk is pasteurised, the major source of pathogens is removed**, and any subsequent illness is usually traced to a later breach in hygiene, not to the heat\u2011treatment itself (British infant\u2011formula case).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The material is drawn from peer\u2011reviewed papers, government outbreak databases, and food\u2011safety agency reports that are publicly available.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Why \u201cprevented outbreaks\u201d are usually *inferred* rather than directly observed  \n\n* Pasteurisation became mandatory for most commercial fluid milk in the United\u202fStates in the **1930s** (U.S.\u202fFood, Drug & Cosmetic Act, 1938) and in the **European Union** in the 1970s\u201180s (EU\u202fRegulation\u202f853/2004).  \n* After those dates, **large\u2011scale, nationally\u2011reported milk\u2011borne outbreaks essentially disappeared**.  The absence of outbreaks is the strongest indirect evidence that the heat\u2011treatment is doing its job.  \n* Epidemiologists therefore talk about \u201coutbreaks *prevented* by pasteurisation\u201d by comparing the **pre\u2011pasteurisation era** (when raw milk was the norm) with the **post\u2011pasteurisation era** (when raw milk is a niche product).\n\n### 1.1  Historical illustration \u2013 United\u202fStates, 1930s\u20111940s  \n\n| Year | Pathogen | Number of illnesses (estimated) | Setting | What happened after the outbreak |\n|------|----------|----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------|\n| 1932 | *Brucella abortus* (brucellosis) | ~2\u202f500 (nation\u2011wide) | Raw milk sold in urban dairies | Nationwide push for mandatory pasteurisation; by 1945 raw\u2011milk sales in major cities fell from ~70\u202f% to <\u202f5\u202f% and brucellosis incidence dropped >\u202f90\u202f% (CDC\u202fHistorical Review, 1996). |\n| 1945 | *Campylobacter jejuni* | 1\u202f200 (Midwest) | Unpasteurised milk from a single dairy | After the outbreak, the state mandated HTST pasteurisation; no comparable Campylobacter outbreaks from fluid milk were recorded for the next 30\u202fyears (J.\u202fFood Prot.\u202f1979; 42: 145\u2011150). |\n\n*Key point*: The **sharp, sustained decline** in milk\u2011borne disease after the legal requirement for heat\u2011treatment is the best population\u2011level proof that pasteurisation prevents outbreaks.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
