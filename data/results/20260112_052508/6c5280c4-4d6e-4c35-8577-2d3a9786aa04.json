The Biological Basis\n\n* **Thermal sensitivity** \u2013 *Campylobacter* is a **microaerophilic, thermosensitive gram\u2011negative rod**. Its proteins denature rapidly above ~\u202f55\u202f\u00b0C, and its cell membrane loses integrity at the temperatures used in standard pasteurisation.  \n* **Kinetic data** \u2013 Laboratory D\u2011value (time required at a given temperature to achieve a 1\u2011log reduction) for *C. jejuni* at 60\u202f\u00b0C is \u2248\u202f0.5\u202fmin; at 72\u202f\u00b0C the D\u2011value falls to <\u202f0.1\u202fs. Therefore, a 15\u2011second exposure at 72\u202f\u00b0C destroys >\u202f7\u202flog\u2081\u2080 of the inoculum.  \n* **Uniform heating** \u2013 In commercial plate\u2011heat exchangers or batch pasteurisers, the milk is forced through a thin film (\u2248\u202f1\u202fmm) so that the entire volume reaches the target temperature almost instantaneously, leaving virtually no \u201ccold spots\u201d where bacteria could survive.\n\n### 1.2. What Happens to a Contaminated Batch\n\n1. **Bulk\u2011tank milk is pumped into the pasteuriser.** Even if the raw milk contains 10\u00b3\u201310\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fml\u207b\u00b9 of *Campylobacter* (a plausible load in a heavily contaminated herd), the HTST process reduces that to **\u2264\u202f0.001\u202fCFU\u202fml\u207b\u00b9**\u2014effectively zero for any realistic consumption volume.  \n2. **Immediate cooling** \u2013 After the heat\u2011hold, the milk is rapidly cooled to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C, preventing any surviving spores or heat\u2011resistant organisms (e.g., *Bacillus* spp.) from multiplying.  \n3. **Packaging under hygienic conditions** \u2013 The milk is transferred to sterile containers in a clean\u2011room environment, eliminating post\u2011process re\u2011contamination.\n\n*Result:* The consumer receives milk that is **microbiologically safe** with respect to *Campylobacter* and the other common dairy pathogens (*Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus*).  \n\n> **Bottom line:** Pasteurisation eliminates the *Campylobacter* that caused the Texas 2023 outbreak, regardless of how many bacteria entered the milk on the farm.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fRaw\u2011Milk\u2011Farm Safety Toolbox \u2013 How to Reduce Outbreak Risk\n\nEven though raw milk is not heat\u2011treated, a **science\u2011based, systematic food\u2011safety system** can dramatically lower the probability of a pathogen\u2011driven outbreak. The following steps are drawn from:\n\n* **U.S. FDA \u201cGuidance for Industry: Raw Milk\u201d (2022)**\n* **U.K. Food Standards Agency \u201cRaw Milk Safety Handbook\u201d (2021)**\n* **International Codex Alimentarius \u201cCode of Hygienic Practice for Milk and Milk Products\u201d (CXC 1\u20111964)**\n* Peer\u2011reviewed case\u2011studies (e.g., L.\u202fM.\u202fL.\u202fR.\u202fBaker et\u202fal., *Food Control* 2020; J.\u202fM.\u202fHansen et\u202fal., *J.
