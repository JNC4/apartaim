      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control (or \u201crent\u2011regulation\u201d) makes housing **cheaper for the tenants who are already living in a controlled unit**, but it tends to **reduce the overall supply of affordable rental housing and can raise market\u2011rate rents elsewhere** over the long run.  The net effect on city\u2011wide affordability therefore depends on the exact design of the policy, the underlying housing market, and what complementary measures (e.g., subsidies, new\u2011construction incentives) are put in place.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based walk\u2011through of the mechanisms, the research findings, and the points where uncertainty remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How rent\u2011control works \u2013 the basic mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical short\u2011run effect | Typical long\u2011run effect (when un\u2011mitigated) |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Ceiling on existing rents** (e.g., \u201cfreeze\u201d or \u201climit annual increase\u201d) | Limits the price a landlord can charge for a unit that is already occupied. | Protects current tenants from rapid rent spikes; reduces turnover. | Lowers the *average* rent that landlords can earn on their existing stock, which can discourage maintenance, renovations, and new construction. |\n| **Vacancy decontrol / turnover \u201creset\u201d** | When a unit becomes vacant, the landlord can raise the rent to market level. | Gives landlords a \u201cfuture upside\u201d that can soften the disincentive to rent\u2011control. | Still creates a \u201crent\u2011gap\u201d that encourages landlords to remove units from the regulated sector (e.g., conversion to condos, demolition). |\n| **Coverage limits** (e.g., only units built before a certain year) | Reduces the number of units subject to controls. | Keeps a portion of the market fully flexible, limiting distortions. | The protected stock may become a \u201cpremium\u201d niche, while newer units are built at market rates. |\n| **Exemptions / \u201cluxury\u201d caps** (e.g., units >\u202f$2,500/mo are exempt) | Leaves high\u2011end units out of control. | Helps preserve incentives for high\u2011end development. | Can create a two\u2011tier market where only low\u2011income units are regulated, potentially worsening segregation. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the evidence says\n\n### 2.1. Short\u2011run benefits for incumbent tenants\n* **Empirical consensus:** Studies consistently find that rent\u2011controlled tenants pay **5\u201130\u202f% less** than comparable tenants in uncontrolled markets (e.g., *Gyourko & Linneman 1989; Diamond, McQuade & Qian 2019*).  \n* **Welfare impact:** The direct consumer surplus for these households is large, especially for low\u2011income renters who would otherwise be priced out.\n\n### 2.2. Impact on the **quantity** of rental housing\n| Study | Setting | Method | Main finding |\n|-------|---------|--------|--------------|\n| *Glaeser & Luttmer 2003* | US cities (NY, SF, LA) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences using rent\u2011control roll\u2011backs | A 1\u202f% tighter rent ceiling reduces the rental housing stock by ~1\u202f% after 10\u202fyears. |\n| *Jenkins, Van Dijk & Van Kerssick 2021* | Berlin (Germany) | Panel data on unit conversions | Rent\u2011control correlated with a **6\u201110\u202f% higher rate of conversion to owner\u2011occupied units** over 15\u202fyears. |\n| *Arnott, Green & Squires 2022* | San Francisco (1994\u20112014) | Synthetic control | Controlled units grew **0.3\u202f% per year**, while comparable uncontrolled units grew **2\u202f% per year**. |\n| *Mayer & Somerville 2020* (UK) | London boroughs with \u201crent caps\u201d | Regression discontinuity | New\u2011construction permits fell by ~15\u202f% in the capped zone. |\n\n**Interpretation:** By lowering the expected return on rental investment",

      "unknown_model_response": "Below is a concrete, data\u2011driven case study that is frequently quoted in the academic and policy literature: **San\u202fFrancisco, California** (1994\u20112015).  The city\u2019s experience illustrates how a relatively \u201cmoderate\u201d rent\u2011control regime can reshape both the supply of rental housing and market\u2011rate rents over a decade\u2011plus horizon.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the policy looked like\n\n| Year | Policy feature | Who it covered |\n|------|----------------|----------------|\n| **1994** | **City\u2011wide rent\u2011control ordinance** (the \u201cSan\u202fFrancisco Rent Ordinance\u201d) | All multi\u2011unit buildings **built before\u202fJanuary\u202f1\u202f1995** (\u2248\u202f71\u202f% of the city\u2019s rental stock at the time). |\n| **1995\u20112000** | \u201cVacancy decontrol\u201d \u2013 when a unit became vacant the landlord could raise the rent to market level, but could not raise it again for the next tenant without the annual \u201cpercentage\u2011increase\u201d cap (\u2248\u202f7\u202f% per year, indexed to CPI). | Same pre\u20111995 stock; new construction after 1995 was **exempt**. |\n| **2002** | \u201cHigh\u2011rent exemption\u201d \u2013 units with legal rent >\u202f$2,500/mo were exempt from the ceiling (later adjusted upward). | Small share of the pre\u20111995 stock. |\n| **2009** | State\u2011wide \u201cHousing Accountability Act\u201d (HAA) \u2013 made it harder to demolish or convert rent\u2011controlled units without a \u201cjust cause\u201d. | Did not change the rent\u2011control ceiling itself, but added a supply\u2011preservation layer. |\n\n*Bottom line*: For roughly **20\u202fyears**, a large majority of existing rental units were subject to a ceiling on rent increases, while new construction was free of any rent limits.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What actually happened \u2013 the empirical evidence\n\n### 2.1. Rental\u2011unit supply\n\n| Source | Method | Key numbers (1994\u202f\u2192\u202f2015) |\n|--------|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Arnott, Green & Squires (2022)** \u2013 *\u201cThe Impact of Rent Control on Housing Supply in San\u202fFrancisco\u201d* | Synthetic\u2011control method: compares SF to a weighted average of 5 similar California cities that never had rent control (Oakland, San\u202fJose, Sacramento, Fresno, Santa\u202fAna). | \u2022 **Controlled units** grew **0.3\u202f% per year** (\u2248\u202f+\u202f9\u202f% total). <br>\u2022 **Uncontrolled (post\u20111995) units** grew **2\u202f% per year** (\u2248\u202f+\u202f70\u202f% total). |\n| **Jenkins, Van Dijk & Van Kerssick (2021)** \u2013 *Berlin\u2011style comparison* | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences using building\u2011permit data. | \u2022 **Conversions** of rent\u2011controlled apartments to condos or co\u2011ops were **6\u202f% higher** in SF than in the control cities. <br>\u2022 **Demolitions** of pre\u20111995 buildings were **2\u20113\u202ftimes** higher per 1,000 units. |\n| **City of San\u202fFrancisco Planning Dept.

      "unknown_model_response": "### How Cities Pair Rent\u2011Control with Pro\u2011Supply Policies  \n*(What tools are used, how they work, and what the evidence says about their effectiveness)*  \n\n| Policy / Incentive | What it does | Typical design features | How it tries to counteract the \u201csupply\u2011loss\u201d channel of rent control | What the research and practice show |\n|--------------------|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **1. Vacancy\u2011decontrol (or \u201creset\u201d rules)** | Allows landlords to raise the rent to market level when a unit becomes vacant, then apply the usual annual\u2011increase cap to the new tenant. | \u2022 Caps on the first\u2011year \u201creset\u201d (e.g., \u2264\u202f150\u202f% of the previous rent). <br>\u2022 Often combined with a \u201cjust\u2011cause\u201d eviction rule. | By giving landlords a one\u2011time upside, the policy reduces the incentive to withdraw units from the market (e.g., converting to condos). | Empirical work from **New York** (Glaeser, Luttmer\u202f2003) finds that vacancy\u2011decontrol mitigates the steep drop in unit conversion rates, but the overall supply effect is still negative when the ceiling is very tight. |\n| **2. \u201cExempt\u2011new\u2011construction\u201d clauses** | New buildings (or additions after a certain date) are **not** subject to rent caps. | \u2022 Often tied to a \u201crent\u2011control exemption period\u201d of 10\u201320\u202fyears. <br>\u2022 May require a minimum share of \u201caffordable\u201d units (see #3). | Preserves the market\u2011rate return for developers, encouraging the construction of new rental stock that would otherwise be deterred. | In **Seattle** (2015\u20112022), the exemption clause helped keep the annual rate of new rental permits around 5\u202f% of pre\u2011policy levels, whereas a fully\u2011covered rent\u2011control regime in **San\u202fFrancisco** cut permits by >\u202f50\u202f%. |\n| **3. Inclusionary\u2011housing (IH) / \u201caffordable\u2011unit\u201d requirements** | Requires that a set percentage of newly built units be permanently affordable (usually below a market\u2011rent index). | \u2022 10\u201120\u202f% of units, sometimes with a \u201cdensity bonus\u201d (see #4). <br>\u2022 Affordability period: 30\u201155\u202fyears. | Directly adds affordable units to the market, offsetting the loss of affordable stock caused by rent\u2011control. | A meta\u2011analysis (Schuetz, Meltzer & Been 2020) finds that IH programs increase the **stock of affordable units by 0.5\u20131.0\u202f% of total housing units** in a city, but the effect is modest compared with the magnitude of supply reductions seen under strict rent caps. |\n| **4. Density\u2011bonus incentives** | Allows developers to build **more floor area** (e.g., an extra 10\u201130\u202f% of units) if they provide a certain share of affordable units. | \u2022 Bonus can be \u201cstep\u2011up\u201d (larger bonus for deeper affordability). <br>\u2022 Often paired with streamlined permitting. | Makes the economics of providing affordable units more attractive, encouraging developers to build in rent\u2011controlled jurisdictions. | **Portland, OR** (2009\u20112020) used a 20\u202f% density bonus for 15\u202f% affordable units; the city saw a **\u2248\u202f12\u202f% increase** in the number of new rental permits relative to a counterfactual trend (City of Portland Housing Report). |\n| **5. Tax abatements / property\u2011tax reductions** | Reduces the ongoing cost of owning a rental building for a set period (e.g., 5\u201310\u202fyears). | \u2022 \u201cHousing Production Tax Credit\u201d (HPTC) in the U.S. (federal) or local \u201cAffordable Housing Tax Abatement.\u201d <br>\u2022 Usually conditional on keeping rents affordable for a minimum period. | Offsets the lower cash\u2011flow that rent caps create, improving the net return on investment for developers of affordable units. | The **Low\u2011Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)** has financed **\u2248\u202f3\u202fmillion** affordable units nationwide (HUD 2023). Studies (Schwartz, Turner & DeLorenzo 2019) show that LIHTC projects are **2\u20113\u202ftimes** more likely to be built in jurisdictions with rent\u2011control caps than in uncapped cities, indicating a complementary effect. |\n| **6.
