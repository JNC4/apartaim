How economists measure \u201cimpact on workers\u201d\n\n| Dimension | Typical metric | Why it matters |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Employment level** | Change in total jobs or unemployment rate | Direct indicator of whether people are *working* or *looking for work*. |\n| **Wage growth** | Real hourly earnings, wage dispersion | Reflects *how much* workers earn after price changes. |\n| **Job quality** | Hours, contract type (permanent vs. temporary), benefits, occupational skill level | Captures *security* and *career prospects*. |\n| **Geographic distribution** | Regional employment shifts, migration flows | Shows who bears the adjustment costs. |\n| **Productivity & real income** | GDP per worker, household consumption | Indicates whether the economy as a whole is richer. |\n\nResearchers use **difference\u2011in\u2011differences (DiD)** designs (comparing a country that signed an FTA to a similar country that did not, before and after the treaty), **synthetic\u2011control methods**, and **computable general\u2011equilibrium (CGE) models** to isolate the trade\u2011policy effect from other macro\u2011economic forces.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
