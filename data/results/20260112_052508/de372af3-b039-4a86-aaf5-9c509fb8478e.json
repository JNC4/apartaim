      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 a quick definition**  \nEconomic sanctions are coercive, non\u2011military tools that one (or more) states use to try to change the behavior of another state (or a non\u2011state actor) by restricting trade, finance, travel, or access to specific goods and services.  They can be **unilateral** (imposed by a single country) or **multilateral** (imposed by a coalition, most often through the United Nations, the European Union, or a group of like\u2011minded states).  \n\nBelow is a systematic, evidence\u2011based overview of **how sanctions tend to influence target\u2011country behavior**, followed by the **main arguments on each side**, the **scientific consensus**, and the **areas where scholars still disagree**.  The goal is to give you a \u201cfull\u2011picture\u201d so you can judge the likely impact of sanctions in any particular case.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical pathways \u2013 how sanctions are supposed to work  \n\n| Mechanism | What it does | Typical expected outcome |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Economic cost\u2011imposition** | Cuts off revenue (e.g., oil export bans, asset freezes) and raises the price of imports. | Reduces the government\u2019s fiscal capacity, making costly policies (war, repression) harder to sustain. |\n| **Domestic pressure** | Economic pain spreads to the general population, business community, and elites who may pressure leaders to change policy. | Regime may negotiate, reform, or even collapse if elite cohesion breaks. |\n| **Signalling & isolation** | Declares a target as a pariah, limiting diplomatic engagement and access to international finance. | Deters future \u201cundesirable\u201d actions by raising the reputational cost. |\n| **Deterrence of third parties** | Shows that violation of norms will be punished. | Reduces the chance that other states will follow the target\u2019s behavior. |\n| **Targeted\u2011sanctions effect** | Freezes assets or bans travel of specific individuals, rather than the whole economy. | Pressures decision\u2011makers while minimizing humanitarian fallout. |\n\nThese mechanisms are **not mutually exclusive**; a single sanctions package often tries to combine several at once.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the empirical literature finds  \n\n### 2.1 Broad\u2011scale meta\u2011analyses (the \u201cbig picture\u201d)\n\n| Study | Sample | Main result | Caveats |\n|-------|--------|-------------|---------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009) \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*** | 221 sanction episodes (1945\u20112005) | **\u2248 34\u202f%** of sanctions achieved their stated foreign\u2011policy goals; success rises to **\u2248 60\u202f%** when sanctions are multilateral, target a small\u2011ish economy, and are paired with a credible threat of force. | Success is defined as \u201cpolicy change\u201d (often vague). The database is skewed toward high\u2011visibility cases. |\n| **Drezner (2011) \u2013 *The Sanctions Paradox*** | 120 cases, focusing on the *type* of sanction (unilateral vs multilateral) | Multilateral sanctions are **2\u20133\u00d7** more likely to succeed than unilateral ones; unilateral sanctions often backfire by rallying domestic support for the target regime. | Uses \u201cpolicy change\u201d as binary; does not fully capture partial compliance. |\n| **Peksen (2019) \u2013 *Sanctions and the Propensity for Democracy* (J. Conflict Resolution)** | 199 cases of targeted sanctions (2000\u20112015) | Targeted sanctions increase the probability of **democratic transition** by ~12\u202f% when the target is a hybrid regime and the sanctioning coalition includes a major power. | \u201cTransition\u201d includes both peaceful reforms and regime change after conflict; causality can be hard to isolate. |\n| **Bapat, Hufbauer & Manffet (2020) \u2013 *COVID\u201119 and the Sanctions Landscape*** | 40 sanctions imposed during the pandemic | Sanctions that restricted medical supplies had **negative humanitarian outcomes** but did **not** measurably increase the target\u2019s compliance with non\u2011health\u2011related demands. | Small sample; outcomes measured over a short time horizon. |\n| **Khalid & Yadav (",

The case illustrates why sanctions can work, what limits their power, and why scholars still debate how much credit the sanctions themselves deserve.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  The background \u2013 what the world wanted Iran to do  \n\n| Goal of the sanctioning coalition | How it was framed |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability** (i.e., keep uranium enrichment below weapons\u2011grade levels and limit plutonium production). | \u201cNon\u2011proliferation\u201d was the diplomatic umbrella; the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) had already passed **Resolution\u202f2231** (2015) endorsing the deal, and the United States, European Union, and several Gulf states pressed for a *binding* limit on enrichment. |\n| **Create a \u201ccarrot\u2011and\u2011stick\u201d environment** \u2013 severe economic pain to push Tehran back to the negotiating table, followed by a promise of sanctions relief if it complied. | The \u201cstick\u201d came from **UN, US, EU, and secondary\u2011sanctions** on Iran\u2019s oil, banking, and shipping sectors; the \u201ccarrot\u201d was the prospect of *full sanctions lift* and re\u2011integration into the global financial system. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
