Why\u202fdo\u202fmost paediatricians and public\u2011health doctors recommend childhood vaccines?\n\n| Goal of vaccination | How it is achieved | Why it matters for a child (and the community) |\n|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Prevent serious disease** | Immunisation \u201cteaches\u201d the immune system to recognise a pathogen without the child having to endure the disease itself. | Diseases such as measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and Haemophilus\u202finfluenzae\u202ftype\u202fb (Hib) can cause hospitalization, permanent disability, or death. |\n| **Reduce complications and long\u2011term sequelae** | Many infections leave lasting damage (e.g., encephalitis after measles, permanent paralysis after polio, hearing loss after meningitis). | Avoiding these outcomes protects a child\u2019s development, learning ability and quality of life. |\n| **Protect the most vulnerable** | Herd immunity \u2013 when a high proportion of the population is immune, transmission chains are broken. | Infants too young to be fully vaccinated, people with immune\u2011system disorders, or those for whom the vaccine is less effective (e.g., the elderly) are shielded. |\n| **Limit outbreaks and health\u2011system strain** | By keeping incidence low, vaccines keep emergency rooms, intensive\u2011care units and public\u2011health resources from being overwhelmed. | A healthier system can continue to provide routine care, surgery, and chronic\u2011disease management for all children. |\n| **Economic and social benefits** | Fewer doctor visits, hospital stays, and parental work\u2011days lost; lower public\u2011health spending. | Families can stay in school or work, and societies avoid the large economic costs of epidemic control measures. |\n| **Facilitate global travel and schooling** | International travel, summer camps, and school attendance require proof of immunisation (e.g., MMR, varicella). | Ensures children can safely participate in everyday activities without exposing others. |\n\nThese reasons are grounded in decades of epidemiologic data that show dramatic declines in disease incidence after vaccine introduction. For example:\n\n| Vaccine | Disease incidence (U.S.) before vaccine | Disease incidence after vaccine (average of last 10\u202fy) | %\u202freduction |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) | Diphtheria 100\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000; Pertussis 200\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000 (1960s) | Diphtheria <0.1\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000; Pertussis \u224830\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000 (2020\u20112023) | >99\u202f% for diphtheria, >80\u202f% for pertussis |\n| MMR (measles) | ~500\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000 (1970s) | 0\u20115\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000 (pre\u2011COVID\u201119) | >99\u202f% |\n| Polio (IPV) | Thousands of cases annually (pre\u20111955) | 0\u20111 case per year in the U.S. (2022\u20112024) | >99.9\u202f% |\n| Hib | 40\u201170\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000 (pre\u20111990) | <0.5\u202f/\u202f100\u202f000 (2020\u20112024) | >99\u202f% |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How safe are childhood vaccines, according to the scientific evidence?\n\n### 2.1\u202fWhat \u201csafety\u201d means in this context  \n\n* **Common, mild reactions** \u2013 e.g., pain at the injection site, low\u2011grade fever, mild rash. These usually resolve within a few days and are a normal sign that the immune system is responding.  \n* **Rare, moderate\u2011severity events** \u2013 e.g., febrile seizures after certain live\u2011virus vaccines, temporary joint pain after the meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Occur in roughly 1\u201310 per\u202f10\u202f000 doses.  \n* **Very rare serious adverse events (SAEs)** \u2013 e.g., anaphylaxis, Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), thrombocytopenia, severe allergic reactions. Occur in roughly 1\u201310 per\u202fmillion doses, and most are treatable when recognized promptly.  \n\n### 2.2\u202fKey sources that evaluate safety  \n\n| Source | Type of data | Main finding on safety |\n|--------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)** (passive reporting) | >1\u202fbillion doses reported, >600",

The absolute risk of severe disease in an unvaccinated child is many orders of magnitude larger than the risk of a serious vaccine reaction. |\n| **Protection of the community (herd immunity)** | \u2022\u202fMathematical models and real\u2011world data demonstrate that when \u2265\u202f90\u201395\u202f% of a population is immunised against measles, transmission drops dramatically (WHO\u202f2020).<br>\u2022\u202fOutbreaks of pertussis, measles, and varicella re\u2011emerge in pockets of low coverage (e.g., the 2019 measles resurgence in the U.S.,\u202f>\u202f1\u202f200 cases). | Physicians recommend vaccinating each child not only for that child\u2019s benefit but also to protect infants too young to be vaccinated, immunocompromised patients, and others who cannot mount a protective response. |\n| **Cost\u2011effectiveness and health\u2011system impact** | \u2022\u202fEconomic analyses consistently rank routine childhood vaccination among the most cost\u2011saving public\u2011health interventions (e.g., $1\u202fUSD saved for every $1\u202fspent on the U.S. childhood schedule,\u202fKim et\u202fal.,\u202f2021).<br>\u2022\u202fAvoided hospitalisations, long\u2011term disability, and productivity losses are quantified in national health\u2011economics models. | From a health\u2011policy perspective, physicians follow guidelines that reflect a strong societal return on investment. |\n| **Facilitation of normal development (school, travel, childcare)** | \u2022\u202fMany schools, daycare centres, and international travel requirements mandate proof of immunisation. Non\u2011vaccinated children may be excluded, limiting social and educational opportunities. | The recommendation aligns with legal and practical realities of participation in modern society. |\n| **Evidence\u2011based standard of care** | \u2022\u202fProfessional bodies (American Academy of Pediatrics, CDC\u202fAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices, WHO, European Medicines",

The same basic principles apply to the measles\u2011only vaccine (MMRV) that some countries use.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What \u201clive\u2011attenuated\u201d means  \n\n| Term | What it really is | Why it can be used safely |\n|------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Live** | The virus is still alive \u2013 it can replicate, but only inside human cells. | The strain has been **attenuated** (weakened) through many passages in laboratory culture, so it loses the ability to cause the severe disease that wild\u2011type measles causes. |\n| **Attenuated** | Genetic changes (mutations, deletions) reduce the virus\u2019s capacity to invade the lower respiratory tract, spread systemically, and evade the immune system. | The virus can still make a few copies in the **skin and upper respiratory mucosa**, enough to \u201cshow the immune system the enemy\u201d without causing full\u2011blown infection. |\n\n*Think of it as a \u201ctraining dummy\u201d that looks like the real virus but can\u2019t fight back.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. The immune response that the vaccine triggers  \n\n1. **Injection (subcutaneous or intramuscular)** deposits ~0.5\u202fmL of vaccine into the tissue.  \n2. **Local replication** \u2013 the attenuated measles virus infects a few cells at the injection site and in nearby lymph nodes.  \n3. **Antigen presentation** \u2013 infected cells display viral proteins (the \u201cantigens\u201d) on their surface. Dendritic cells pick up these antigens and travel to the **regional lymph nodes**.  \n4. **Activation of T\u2011cells** \u2013  \n   * **CD4+ helper T cells** recognise the measles antigens and release cytokines that \u201ccoach\u201d other immune cells.  \n   * **CD8+ cytotoxic T cells** are primed to recognise and destroy any cell that later shows measles proteins (important for clearing actual infection).  \n5. **B\u2011cell activation & antibody production** \u2013 B cells that bind measles proteins receive help from CD4+ T cells, differentiate into **plasma cells**, and secrete **measles\u2011specific IgM** (early) followed by **IgG** antibodies.  \n6. **Memory formation** \u2013 A small pool of **memory B cells** and **memory T cells** persists for many years (decades). If the child later encounters wild\u2011type measles virus, these memory cells mount a rapid, high\u2011titer response that neutralises the virus before it can cause disease.  \n\n**Result:** After the first dose, ~93\u202f% of children develop protective IgG levels; after the second dose (given at 4\u20116\u202fyears of age, or at least 28\u202fdays after the first dose in outbreak settings), >\u202f99\u202f% are immune.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Studies show that children with such titres rarely, if ever, develop measles even after high\u2011dose exposure. |\n| **Duration of immunity** | - **\u2265\u202f99\u202f%** of children remain seropositive 20\u202fyears after the two\u2011dose series.<br>- Long\u2011term studies (up to 30\u202fyears) show **no meaningful waning** of protection in immunocompetent individuals. Booster doses are not routinely recommended for the general population. |\n\n---\n\n## Safety Profile \u2013 What the Data Show  \n\n### 1.
