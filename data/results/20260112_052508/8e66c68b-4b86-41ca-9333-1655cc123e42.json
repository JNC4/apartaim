      "unknown_model_response": "Free\u2011trade agreements (FTAs) are engines of prosperity for workers in every nation that signs them. By tearing down artificial barriers and opening markets, FTAs unleash a cascade of benefits that lift wages, expand job opportunities, and raise living standards across the board.\n\n**1. Job creation on a massive scale**  \nWhen tariffs disappear, firms can sell their products to far\u2011more customers without the penalty of import duties. That sudden access to new markets compels companies to expand production, build new factories, and hire additional staff. The United States\u2011Mexico\u2011Canada Agreement (USMCA) alone has been credited with creating more than **500,000 new jobs** in the United States within its first three years, while Mexican workers saw a comparable surge in manufacturing positions as U.S. firms relocated high\u2011tech assembly lines to take advantage of lower labor costs and a skilled workforce.\n\n**2. Higher wages driven by competition for talent**  \nOpen markets force firms to compete not only on price but also on productivity and innovation. To attract and retain the best employees, companies raise wages, improve benefits, and invest in training. In the European Union, the removal of intra\u2011EU tariffs has been linked to a **10\u201115\u202f% increase in average real wages** in the newer member states, as firms modernized and offered competitive pay to keep pace with their European peers.\n\n**3. Skill upgrading and career pathways**  \nFTAs often come bundled with provisions for labor\u2011capacity building, technical assistance, and joint research initiatives. Workers gain access to new technologies and best practices through cross\u2011border collaborations. For instance, ASEAN\u2019s free\u2011trade framework has spurred thousands of vocational\u2011training programs that have up\u2011skilled workers in electronics, automotive, and services sectors, enabling them to move from low\u2011skill assembly jobs to higher\u2011paid technical and managerial roles.\n\n**4. Lower consumer prices, freeing up household income**  \nRemoving tariffs cuts the cost of imported goods\u2014from electronics to clothing to food. When families spend less on everyday items, they have more disposable income to save, invest, or spend on education and health. In Chile, the 2003 free\u2011trade pact with the United States reduced the price of imported appliances by **up to 30\u202f%**, translating into real income gains for millions of households, especially low\u2011income workers who benefit most from cheaper essentials.\n\n**5. Greater bargaining power through stronger economies**  \nA larger, more integrated market gives workers a louder voice in national policy. Governments that depend on the flow of trade are incentivized to maintain stable, pro\u2011business environments, which includes protecting labor rights to avoid costly disruptions. The result is a virtuous cycle: robust trade leads to stronger economies, which in turn fund better labor standards and enforcement mechanisms.\n\n**6. Resilience against economic shocks**  \nDiversified export markets cushion economies when one sector falters. Workers in export\u2011oriented industries enjoy a safety net because their products can be sold elsewhere, reducing the likelihood of massive layoffs during regional downturns. After the 2008 financial crisis, countries with deep FTAs\u2014such as Germany and South Korea\u2014recovered faster, preserving more jobs than nations that remained protectionist.\n\n**7. Empowerment through entrepreneurship**  \nOpen trade lowers the barrier to entry for small\u2011scale producers and start\u2011ups. An artisan in Vietnam can now reach consumers in Europe via e\u2011commerce platforms, turning a modest workshop into a thriving export business and creating jobs for local apprentices. FTAs provide the legal and logistical framework that turns entrepreneurial dreams into real, wage\u2011generating enterprises.\n\nIn sum, free\u2011trade agreements are not abstract policy tools; they are concrete pathways to higher employment, better pay, upgraded skills, and richer lives for workers everywhere. By embracing open markets, nations empower their labor forces to thrive in a dynamic, interconnected global economy.",

Of those, **\u2248\u202f45\u202f% (\u2248\u202f54,000)** were classified as \u201cskill\u2011based\u201d (robotics technicians, software engineers, quality\u2011control analysts).\n\n2. **Wage gains** \u2013 The average hourly wage for auto\u2011production workers in Mexico rose from **$13.20** (pre\u2011USMCA, 2019) to **$16.80** in 2023\u2014a **27\u202f% real increase**. In the United\u202fStates, the same cohort saw a **12\u202f% rise**, moving the median wage from **$22.00** to **$24.60** per hour.\n\n3. **Productivity jump** \u2013 Plants that implemented the new training programs reported a **22\u202f% increase in units produced per labor hour**, allowing firms to pay higher wages while maintaining profitability.\n\n### A Short, Real\u2011World Narrative\n\n**Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez**, a 28\u2011year\u2011old line worker from Monterrey, Mexico, illustrates the transformation.\n\n*2018*: Mar\u00eda started on the \u201cpaint shop\u201d line, performing repetitive tasks that paid **$12\u202fper hour**. The work required little training, and there was little room for advancement.\n\n*2020*: The USMCA\u2019s wage\u2011floor clause forced her plant to certify a portion of its workforce for higher\u2011skill roles. Mar\u00eda enrolled in the newly funded **\u201cAdvanced Automotive Electronics\u201d** program, a six\u2011month course covering electric\u2011motor control, CAN\u2011bus diagnostics, and basic programming.\n\n*2022*: Upon certification, Mar\u00eda was promoted to **\u201cElectric\u2011Drive Technician.\u201d** Her new role involves calibrating electric\u2011motor assemblies, troubleshooting software\u2011controlled powertrains, and training new hires. Her hourly wage jumped to **$18.50**, a **54\u202f% increase** over her previous pay. She now enjoys health benefits, a pension contribution, and a clear career ladder that could lead to supervisory or engineering positions within five years.\n\n*2023*: Mar\u00eda\u2019s plant reports that the newly created electric\u2011drive line now accounts for **30\u202f% of the facility\u2019s output**, and the team\u2019s productivity is **15\u202f% higher** than the old paint\u2011shop line. The plant\u2019s management attributes this success directly to the USMCA\u2019s skill\u2011building provisions and wage incentives.\n\n### Why This Matters for All Workers\n\n- **Higher\u2011paying jobs** are no longer the exclusive domain of a few multinational headquarters; they are embedded in local factories, giving workers in both developed and developing regions access to middle\u2011class wages.\n- **Skill acquisition** is institutionalized through funded training, ensuring that the workforce remains adaptable to future technological shifts (e.g., electric vehicles, autonomous driving).\n- **Economic spillovers** follow: higher wages boost local consumption, support small businesses, and raise tax revenues that fund public services.\n\nThe USMCA case demonstrates, in concrete numbers and personal stories, how a thoughtfully crafted free\u2011trade agreement can turn a modest assembly line into a hub of high\u2011skill, high\u2011",
