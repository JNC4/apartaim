The isolates from patients matched the isolates from the raw milk (\u22640\u202fSNP difference). |\n| **Root cause** | The farm\u2019s herd had **asymptomatic cattle shedding *Campylobacter*** in their feces. Because raw milk is collected directly from the udder and **not heat\u2011treated**, any fecal contamination that entered the milk during milking (e.g., from dirty teats, milking equipment, or the environment) survived unchanged. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | The farm\u2019s licence to sell raw milk was suspended; the state issued a \u201cpublic health order\u201d prohibiting raw\u2011milk sales for 90\u202fdays.

Pasteurisation in plain language  \n\n### 1.1\u202fWhat the word means  \n*Pasteurisation* is a short, controlled heating step that was invented by Louis\u202fPasteur in the 1860s.

Receive raw milk** | Milk arrives chilled (\u22484\u202f\u00b0C) from the farm in large stainless\u2011steel tanks. | Keeping it cold slows any bacterial growth before the heat treatment. |\n| **2. Test & filter** | Quick microbiological tests are run; the milk may be passed through a fine filter to remove large particles. | Removes obvious contamination and assures the plant meets safety limits before heating. |\n| **3. Heat\u2011treat** | The milk is pumped through a **heat\u2011exchanger** that raises its temperature to a set value for a precise amount of time.

The \u201cshort\u2011time\u201d version is used for the bulk of retail milk because it preserves flavour and nutrients better while still being safe. |\n| **4. Rapid cool** | Immediately after the heating zone, the milk passes through a second heat\u2011exchanger that brings it down to \u22644\u202f\u00b0C (\u224839\u202f\u00b0F). | Cooling stops any bacteria that survived (they can\u2019t multiply at refrigerator temperature) and prepares the milk for storage/shipping. |\n| **5. Homogenise (optional)** | Milk is forced through tiny holes at high pressure, breaking fat globules into a uniform size. | Gives the milk a smooth, consistent texture; this step is **not** part of the safety kill\u2011step. |\n| **6. Package** | The chilled, pasteurised milk is filled into sterile bottles, cartons, or bags in a **clean\u2011room** environment. | Prevents *post\u2011pasteurisation* contamination. |\n| **7. Store & ship** | Packaged milk stays refrigerated (\u22644\u202f\u00b0C) until it reaches the grocery store and the consumer\u2019s fridge. | Keeps any surviving, non\u2011pathogenic microbes from growing. |\n\n### 1.3\u202fWhat the numbers mean  \n\n| Regimen | Typical temperature | Time at that temperature | Approximate bacterial kill (log\u2011reduction) |\n|---------|--------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **HTST** (most supermarket milk) | **72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F)** | **15\u202fseconds** | **\u22655\u2011log** (\u226599.999\u202f% of *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*, *Campylobacter* are destroyed) |\n| **LTLT** (sometimes called \u201cbatch pasteurisation\u201d) | **63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F)** | **30\u202fminutes** | Similar 5\u2011log kill; a little gentler on heat\u2011sensitive enzymes |\n| **UHT** (shelf\u2011stable milk) | **135\u2011140\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2011284\u202f\u00b0F)** | **2\u20115\u202fseconds** | **\u22656\u2011log**; makes milk sterile for months at room temperature |\n\n> **Bottom line:** The heat is high enough to smash the membranes and proteins of disease\u2011causing bacteria, but the exposure is brief enough that the milk\u2019s taste, colour, and most nutrients stay essentially the same.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Heat the milk** | The cold milk is pumped through a **heat\u2011exchanger** (think of a very big, stainless\u2011steel \u201ckettle\u201d that can heat quickly and evenly). The milk is raised to a **specific temperature** and held there for a **set amount of time**. This is the \u201ckill\u2011step.\u201d | **HTST (high\u2011temperature short\u2011time)** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for **15\u202fseconds** (the most common method for fluid milk sold in grocery stores).<br>**LTLT (low\u2011temperature long\u2011time)** \u2013 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for **30\u202fminutes** (used for some specialty \u201cbatch\u2011pasteurised\u201d or \u201ccream\u2011top\u201d milks).<br>**UHT (ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature)** \u2013 135\u2011145\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2011293\u202f\u00b0F) for **2\u20115\u202fseconds** (produces milk that can sit at room temperature for months). |\n| **3. Cool the milk quickly** | Immediately after the heat\u2011hold, the milk is sent through another heat\u2011exchanger that **cools it back down** to refrigeration temperature (\u2248\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C). Rapid cooling stops any remaining bacteria from recovering and keeps the milk fresh. | Target \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C within a few minutes. |\n| **4. Homogenise (optional but almost universal)** | The milk is forced through tiny holes at high pressure so the fat droplets are broken up and stay evenly suspended. This gives the familiar smooth, \u201cnon\u2011creamy\u2011top\u201d appearance. | Not a safety step, but part of the standard production line. |\n| **5. Package and refrigerate** | The milk is pumped into sterile cartons, bottles, or bags, sealed, and shipped under refrigeration. | \u2013 |\n\n### Why those temperature\u2011time combos work  \n\n- **Heat kills bacteria** by denaturing (unfolding) the proteins that keep the cell alive and by breaking down the cell membrane.  \n- The **\u201clog\u2011reduction\u201d** concept: each 10\u202f\u00b0C increase roughly cuts the surviving bacterial count by a factor of 10 (a \u201c1\u2011log\u201d drop). Holding at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fseconds gives **\u22655\u2011log** (\u226599.999\u202f%) reduction for *most* disease\u2011causing bacteria that are present in raw milk (e.g., *Salmonella, *Campylobacter, *Listeria monocytogenes, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7).  \n- The **UHT** method raises the temperature so high that even heat\u2011resistant spores (which can later germinate into bacteria) are destroyed, allowing the milk to be stored without refrigeration.  \n\n---\n\n## 2.  Does the heat damage the nutrition of milk?  \n\n### 2.1  What the science says \u2013 nutrient\u2011by\u2011nutrient summary  \n\n| Nutrient | How heat affects it | What studies have measured (typical change) |\n|----------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Protein** (casein, whey) | Proteins are **relatively heat\u2011stable** at HTST temperatures; they may **denature slightly** (unfold) but this does **not reduce the amount of usable protein**. In fact, denatured whey proteins can become *more* digestible. | <1\u202f% loss of total nitrogen; no measurable change in amino\u2011acid profile (FAO/WHO 2020 review). |\n| **Fat** (including conjugated linoleic acid, CLA) | Fat globules are **not destroyed** by pasteurisation. Minor oxidation can occur at very high temperatures (UHT), producing trace amounts of lipid peroxides that are quickly neutralised by antioxidants in milk. | \u2264\u202f2\u202f% decrease in CLA after UHT; negligible after HTST. |\n|",
