      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe overwhelming majority of peer\u2011reviewed research, large\u2011scale meta\u2011analyses, and the assessments of the world\u2019s major food\u2011safety agencies conclude that the **currently commercialised genetically\u2011modified (GM) foods that have passed regulatory review are not unsafe for human consumption**.  At the same time, a smaller body of work raises **specific, mechanistic concerns** (e.g., allergenicity, horizontal gene transfer, unintended compositional changes) that have not been borne out in the large\u2011scale feeding studies that have been done.  Because safety is judged **case\u2011by\u2011case**, the evidence base is best understood as a continuum: strong, consistent data supporting safety for the products that have been studied, plus a set of open questions that guide future testing of new traits and new editing technologies.\n\nBelow is a structured overview of the evidence, grouped by the type of study or assessment, together with the most frequently cited references (year, journal or agency).  Wherever possible I note whether the finding is *well\u2011established* (multiple independent lines of evidence, consensus among major scientific bodies) or *still debated* (limited data, methodological criticism, or conflicting results).\n\n---\n\n## 1.
