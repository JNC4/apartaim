      "unknown_model_response": "**Economic sanctions \u2013 what they are and how they are supposed to work**\n\n| Element | What it means | How it is expected to affect the target |\n|---------|---------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Primary goal** | Coerce a change in policy, deter future actions, punish past conduct, or signal disapproval. | By making the cost of the unwanted behavior higher than the perceived benefit, the target will alter its calculus. |\n| **Typical tools** | \u2022 Trade bans (imports, exports, specific commodities)  <br>\u2022 Asset freezes and financial restrictions  <br>\u2022 Investment prohibitions  <br>\u2022 Travel bans on officials  <br>\u2022 Limits on access to international finance (e.g., SWIFT, credit lines) | Each tool cuts off a source of revenue, raises the price of essential inputs, or creates political isolation. |\n| **Key mechanisms** | 1. **Economic pressure** \u2013 reduces GDP, government revenue, or the value of key sectors (energy, minerals, agriculture). <br>2. **Political pressure** \u2013 creates internal dissent, elite competition, or elite \u201cdefection\u201d when elites lose wealth or access to foreign assets. <br>3. **Signaling** \u2013 shows that the sanctioning coalition is united and willing to act, which can shift the target\u2019s expectations about future costs. <br>4. **Deterrence** \u2013 the threat of sanctions (or the precedent of previous sanctions) discourages other states or non\u2011state actors from similar conduct. | 1. **Economic pressure** works when the target is dependent on the blocked market or finance. 2. **Political pressure** works when elites care about personal wealth or international legitimacy. 3. **Signaling** works when the target believes the coalition will follow through. 4. **Deterrence** works when the cost of non\u2011compliance is seen as higher than the cost of compliance. |\n\n---\n\n### Theoretical Foundations\n\n1. **Rational\u2011Actor Model** \u2013 Decision\u2011makers weigh costs vs. benefits. Sanctions raise the *cost* side (lost trade, higher inflation, reduced fiscal capacity) while the *benefit* of the disputed policy is unchanged, making compliance the rational choice.\n\n2. **Domestic Audience Cost Model** \u2013 Sanctions can erode a leader\u2019s legitimacy at home (e.g., shortages, unemployment). When domestic pressure rises, leaders may be forced to adjust policy to preserve regime stability.\n\n3. **Elite Incentive Model** \u2013 Many sanctions target financial assets or travel of political elites. By threatening personal wealth or mobility, they aim to create \u201celite defections\u201d that can push the government toward policy change.\n\n4. **Collective\u2011Action/Signaling Model** \u2013 A coordinated sanction package signals a united international front, increasing the perceived probability of further punitive steps (e.g., escalation to military action). This can be enough to change behavior even before the economic damage fully materializes.\n\n---\n\n### How the Mechanisms play out in practice\n\n| Stage | Typical effects | Illustrative examples |\n|-------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| **Immediate** | \u2013 Disruption of trade flows (e.g., export bans on oil, grain). <br>\u2013 Freezing of sovereign or elite assets abroad. | *Iran* (2006\u20112015 UN/US sanctions on oil exports) \u2013 sudden loss of oil revenue. |\n| **Medium\u2011term (months\u2011to\u2011years)** | \u2013 Decline in GDP, currency depreciation, inflation. <br>\u2013 Budget shortfalls that force spending cuts or re\u2011allocation. <br>\u2013 Growing domestic discontent, protests, or elite lobbying. | *South Africa* (anti\u2011apartheid sanctions, 1980s) \u2013 capital flight, reduced foreign investment, increased pressure on the ANC\u2011led government. |\n| **Long\u2011term** | \u2013 Potential policy reversal or negotiation settlement. <br>\u2013 Institutional changes (e.g., diversification of economy, development of alternative payment systems). <br>\u2013 \u201cSanction fatigue\u201d or adaptation (e.g., illicit trade, new partners). | *Cuba* (US embargo, 1960\u2011present) \u2013 limited success in altering political system; the regime survived by realigning trade with allies and developing a parallel \u201cblack\u2011market\u201d economy. |\n\n---\n\n### Empirical evidence on effectiveness\n\n| Finding | Evidence base | Nuance / uncertainty |\n|--------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Success is higher when sanctions are multilateral** | Studies (Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott 2009; Kaempfer & Lowenberg 2020) show that UN\u2011mandated or",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A recent case in which sanctions helped bring about a policy shift  \n**Iran\u2019s nuclear programme \u2013 the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)**  \n\n| Aspect | What happened | How sanctions were used | Why the sanctions mattered |\n|--------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Background (pre\u20112013)** | Iran was enriching uranium beyond the limits set by the 2003\u20112005 UN resolutions and had begun building a more advanced centrifuge cascade. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) repeatedly reported non\u2011compliance. | \u2022 **UN Security\u2011Council resolutions** (e.g., 1737, 1747, 1803) mandated an arms\u2011embargo, a ban on nuclear\u2011related technology, and a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d sanctions regime. <br>\u2022 **U.S. secondary sanctions** (2010\u20112014) targeted non\u2011U.S. banks, shipping firms, and oil companies that did business with Iran, effectively cutting Iran off from the global financial system (SWIFT) and from the world oil market. <br>\u2022 **EU sanctions** mirrored the U.S. measures, adding customs and asset\u2011freeze provisions. | 1. **Economic pain** \u2013 Iran\u2019s oil exports fell from ~2.5\u202fmillion barrels per day (bpd) in 2011 to ~1.0\u202fmillion bpd by early 2014, slashing export revenues by roughly $70\u202fbillion per year. <br>2. **Financial isolation** \u2013 Iranian banks were removed from SWIFT in 2012, making it difficult to settle international trade. <br>3. **Domestic pressure** \u2013 Inflation surged (\u224830\u202f% in 2013), the rial lost >70\u202f% of its value, and the government faced mounting budget deficits. <br>4. **Elite incentives** \u2013 Many Iranian businesspeople and technocrats held assets abroad that were frozen; they lobbied the leadership for relief. |\n| **Negotiation phase (2013\u20112015)** | In November\u202f2013 the Iranian government, under President Hassan\u202fRohani, announced a willingness to negotiate. Six\u2011party talks (Iran + P5+1) began in earnest. | The **threat of *further* sanctions** (e.g., a possible UN \u201coil embargo\u201d that would have halted the remaining legal export capacity) was kept on the table. Simultaneously, **sanctions\u2011relief \u201ccarrots\u201d**\u2014the promise of re\u2011access to the global financial system and to oil markets\u2014were offered as part of any deal. | The **cost\u2011benefit calculus** shifted: staying on the current path meant continued economic collapse; complying with a nuclear\u2011limit framework offered a clear, quantifiable upside (estimated $100\u2011$150\u202fbillion in sanction\u2011relief revenues over several years). |\n| **Outcome \u2013 the JCPOA (July\u202f2015)** | Iran agreed to: <br>\u2022 Reduce its enriched\u2011uranium stockpile to 300\u202fkg (from >10\u202ftons). <br>\u2022 Limit uranium enrichment to 3.67\u202f% (below weapons\u2011grade). <br>\u2022 Cut its number of centrifuges by ~60\u202f% and accept IAEA inspections. | In return, **UN, EU, and U.S. sanctions were lifted**: <br>\u2022 Iranian oil could again be sold on the world market; exports rose from ~1\u202fmillion bpd (2014) to >2\u202fmillion bpd (2016). <br>\u2022 Iranian banks were reinstated on SWIFT; foreign banks re\u2011opened correspondent accounts. | **Empirical assessments** (e.g., IMF staff paper, 2016; Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott, *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered*, 2020) conclude that the *combined* pressure of multilateral sanctions and the credible promise of relief were decisive in moving Tehran from a \u201cno\u2011deal\u201d to a \u201cdeal\u201d stance. |\n| **Post\u2011deal performance** | \u2022 Iran\u2019s GDP grew ~7\u202f% in 2016, the first expansion since 2011. <br>\u2022 Inflation fell to ~9",
