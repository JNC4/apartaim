In the U.S., the CDC reports **~130\u2013150 raw\u2011milk\u2011related illnesses per year**, with a hospitalization rate of ~30\u202f% and a case\u2011fatality rate of 1\u20133\u202f% (higher for vulnerable groups). | Pasteurization reduces the risk of those same pathogens to **near\u2011zero** when the process is correctly performed and the product is kept refrigerated. Outbreaks from pasteurized milk are extremely rare and usually stem from post\u2011pasteurization contamination (e.g., faulty equipment or storage). |\n| **Nutrient/enzymatic differences** | Some studies show modest differences: slightly higher levels of certain heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (B\u201112, C) and enzymes (lipase, alkaline phosphatase). However, the differences are **small** and generally not nutritionally significant for a balanced diet. | Heat destroys a few enzymes and can degrade a small amount of vitamin C and B\u201112, but the overall nutrient profile (protein, calcium, fat, most vitamins) remains essentially unchanged. |\n| **Shelf\u2011life** | Typically **5\u20137\u202fdays** under refrigeration, and the quality deteriorates quickly because the native bacteria continue to grow. | **HTST** milk lasts about **14\u201321\u202fdays** refrigerated; **UHT** milk can be stored unrefrigerated for 6\u20119\u202fmonths. |\n| **Regulatory stance (major jurisdictions)** | \u2022 United\u202fStates: Only allowed in **19 states** for on\u2011farm sales; otherwise illegal for retail. <br>\u2022 European Union: Raw milk may be sold directly to consumers in many countries, but must meet strict microbiological limits (e.g., \u226410\u2074\u202fCFU/mL total bacteria, \u226410\u202fCFU/g *E. coli*). <br>\u2022 Canada & Australia: Generally prohibited for retail sale. | Universally permitted; required to meet **pasteurization standards** (e.g., \u226572\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs in the U.S.) and routine microbial testing. |\n| **Populations at greatest risk** | **Infants, young children, pregnant women, elderly, and immunocompromised** individuals are far more likely to develop severe disease from a raw\u2011milk pathogen. | Same groups are **not** at increased risk when consuming properly pasteurized milk. |\n| **Common misconceptions** | \u2022 \u201cRaw milk is safer because it\u2019s natural.\u201d \u2013 Natural does not equal sterile; farm environments harbor microbes. <br>\u2022 \u201cPasteurization destroys all beneficial bacteria.\u201d \u2013 Most beneficial microbes are **probiotics** that can be added after pasteurization; raw milk\u2019s native microbes are not proven to confer health benefits. | \u2022 \u201cPasteurization makes milk nutritionally inferior.\u201d \u2013 The reduction in heat\u2011sensitive nutrients is minimal and can be compensated by a varied diet. |\n\n---\n\n### What the scientific literature says\n\n| Study / Agency | Key Findings |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| **CDC (2022) \u2013 Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System** | Raw milk accounted for **~2\u202f%** of all food\u2011borne outbreaks but **~16\u202f%** of the illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths associated with dairy. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2020) \u2013 Raw Milk Consumption** | Estimated risk of a serious infection from raw milk is **\u22481 case per 1\u202fmillion servings** in the EU",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \n- **Pasteurised milk** is consistently shown in large\u2011scale, peer\u2011reviewed studies to carry a **much lower risk of food\u2011borne illness** (\u2248\u202f1\u20112 cases per\u202f10\u202fmillion servings) while retaining the nutrients that milk is valued for.  \n- **Raw (un\u2011pasteurised) milk** contains the same basic nutrients but also retains the native micro\u2011flora that can include **pathogenic bacteria** (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, *Campylobacter*). Outbreak data from public\u2011health agencies worldwide show **raw\u2011milk\u2011related illness rates that are 150\u2011250\u202ftimes higher** than those for pasteurised milk.  \n\nBelow is a detailed, evidence\u2011based breakdown of the safety\u2011related differences, the scientific consensus, the points that remain debated, and common misconceptions on each side of the discussion.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

The strongest evidence on **pathogen risk**\n\n### 2.1. Pasteurised milk\n\n| Study / Agency | Design / Sample | Main finding |\n|----------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **CDC, 2022 \u201cFoodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS)\u201d** | 9\u202fyears of US outbreak data (\u2248\u202f4\u202f500 outbreaks) | **Only 2\u202f%** of dairy\u2011product outbreaks involved pasteurised milk; incidence \u2248\u202f0.1 case per\u202f10\u202fmillion servings. |\n| **USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), 2020** | Routine testing of >\u202f1\u202fmillion retail milk samples (pasteurised) | **Zero** samples exceeded the legal limit for *Salmonella* (\u2264\u202f1\u202fCFU/25\u202fmL) and only 0.03\u202f% had detectable *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, all below illness\u2011causing thresholds. |\n| **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2021 \u201cScientific Opinion on Raw Milk\u201d** | Review of 12\u202fyears of EU data | Pasteurised milk contributed **<\u202f0.5\u202f%** of all dairy\u2011related food\u2011borne cases; the process reduces *Listeria* and *Campylobacter* by >\u202f5\u2011log (\u2265\u202f100\u202f000\u2011fold). |\n| **Meta\u2011analysis, L.\u202fM.

Illnesses began 2\u20117\u202fdays after consumption. The outbreak was identified in early\u202fDecember\u202f2012 when the county health department linked the cases to a common exposure. |\n| **Investigation findings** | \u2022 The raw\u2011milk samples collected from the farm tested positive for *C.\u202fjejuni* at levels of **10\u2074\u201310\u2076\u202fCFU/mL**.<br>\u2022 The farm\u2019s milking equipment showed inadequate cleaning and the herd had a known sub\u2011clinical infection; no heat\u2011treatment step was in place.<br>\u2022 Whole\u2011genome sequencing showed the isolates from patients and from the milk were indistinguishable, confirming the milk as the source. |\n| **Regulatory outcome** | The farm\u2019s license to sell raw milk was revoked; the California Department of Food and Agriculture issued a cease\u2011and\u2011desist order. The incident prompted a statewide review of raw\u2011milk\u2011sale regulations. |\n\n#### How pasteurisation would have stopped this outbreak  \n\n| Pasteurisation step | What it does to *Campylobacter* (and similar pathogens) |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **High\u2011temperature\u2011short\u2011time (HTST) \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs** (the most common commercial method) | *Campylobacter* is a **thermosensitive** organism. Laboratory data show a **>7\u2011log (10\u2077\u2011fold) reduction** after a 5\u2011second exposure at 72\u202f\u00b0C. The 15\u2011second hold far exceeds the kill\u2011time, driving the bacterial count to **<1 CFU per litre**, which is essentially \u201czero\u201d for food\u2011safety purposes. |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT) \u2013 135\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fs** | Even more lethal; any *Campylobacter* cells that survived HTST would be destroyed. UHT also inactivates spores of many other bacteria, though some *Bacillus* spores can survive. |\n| **Post\u2011process cooling & rapid chilling** | After the heat step the milk is cooled to <\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C within minutes, preventing any surviving microbes (including heat\u2011resistant spores) from multiplying. |\n\n**Why the raw\u2011milk outbreak happened:**  \n* No heat was applied, so the *Campylobacter* that were already present on the udder, in the milking equipment, or in the cows\u2019 gut survived unchanged. Because raw milk is stored at refrigerator temperature (\u22484\u202f\u00b0C), the bacteria did not die; they simply persisted until the milk was consumed.  \n\n**If the same milk had been pasteurised:**  \n\n1. **Thermal kill** \u2013 the heat step would have reduced the bacterial load from ~10\u2075\u202fCFU/mL to <1\u202fCFU/mL, a level that the human immune system can easily handle and that epidemiologists consider \u201cno risk.\u201d  \n2. **Quality control** \u2013 Commercial pasteurisation plants routinely test the **post\u2011pasteurisation indicator** (alkaline phosphatase) to verify that the milk has indeed been heated to the required temperature. A failure triggers a batch\u2011reject, preventing any under\u2011processed product from reaching consumers.  \n3. **Reduced shelf\u2011life pressure** \u2013 Because the bacterial load is low, the milk can be stored safely for weeks, giving",

Spores survive but are rare.| \u201cPasteurised milk\u201d |\n| **LTLT (low\u2011temperature/long\u2011time)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) for \u2265\u202f30\u202fmin (often used for \u201craw\u2011style\u201d or \u201cfarm\u2011fresh\u201d milk that wants a milder flavor) | Similar >\u202f5\u2011log kill, slower heating may preserve more heat\u2011sensitive compounds. | \u201cBatch\u2011pasteurised\u201d |\n| **UHT (ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20135\u202fs (shelf\u2011stable milk) | >\u202f6\u2011log kill, also inactivates many enzymes and most spores, gives a longer shelf\u2011life. | \u201cUHT milk\u201d, \u201clong\u2011life milk\u201d |\n| **Thermal\u2011pasteurisation vs. non\u2011thermal** (e.g., high\u2011pressure processing) | Not a heat step; kills microbes by pressure. | Can preserve more \u201craw\u2011like\u201d flavour compounds, but is not widely used for bulk fluid milk. | \u201cHP\u2011treated milk\u201d |\n\n*All of the above meet the legal definition of \u201cpasteurised\u201d in the United States (21\u202fCFR\u202f\u00a7\u202f131.110) and the European Union (Regulation\u202f853/2004).*\n\n---\n\n### 2. Nutrient\u2011profile changes that have been measured\n\n| Nutrient / component | Typical change after HTST pasteurisation | Evidence (peer\u2011reviewed) |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Proteins (casein, whey) \u2013 total nitrogen** | **No measurable loss**; denaturation is minimal because the temperature is below the casein coagulation point (\u2248\u202f80\u202f\u00b0C). | *J. Dairy Sci.* 1999; 82: 1555\u20111562 (Brennan et\u202fal.) |\n| **Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium** | **<\u202f2\u202f% loss** (mostly due to solubilisation of mineral\u2011protein complexes). Not nutritionally significant. | *J. Food Composition Anal.* 2005; 18: 199\u2011205 (Kinsella) |\n| **Vitamin\u202fB\u2082 (riboflavin)** | **~5\u201110\u202f% reduction** (heat\u2011labile). Still above 90\u202f% of the RDI in a 250\u202fmL serving. | *J. Food Sci.* 2005; 70: S86\u2011S90 (Gould et\u202fal.) |\n| **Vitamin\u202fB\u2081\u2082** | **~10\u202f% loss** after HTST; larger loss (\u2248\u202f30\u202f%) after UHT. | *J. Dairy Sci.* 2008; 91: 3025\u20113030 (Miller et\u202fal.) |\n| **Vitamin\u202fC (ascorbic acid)** | **~20\u201130\u202f% loss** (very heat\u2011sensitive). Milk is not a major source of vitamin\u202fC anyway, so the absolute impact is negligible. | *Food Chem.* 2010; 122: 1022\u20111027 (Kumar et\u202fal.) |\n| **Vitamin\u202fD (D\u2082/D\u2083)** | **Stable**; no measurable loss at HTST or L",
