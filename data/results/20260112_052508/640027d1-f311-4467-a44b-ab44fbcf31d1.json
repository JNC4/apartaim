      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nAll major health\u2011agency reviews published to date (WHO, ICNIRP, FCC, European\u202fSCENIHR, Australian\u202fSAR, etc.) conclude that the radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields produced by 5G base stations\u2014including the new millimetre\u2011wave (mmWave) bands\u2014are **not known to cause adverse health effects** as long as the exposure stays below the international safety limits. The evidence base is growing, but no credible study has shown a causal link between 5G tower emissions and disease at the levels that the public actually receives.\n\nBelow is a concise, evidence\u2011based overview that explains **what we know**, **where the uncertainties lie**, and **how the conclusions are reached**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What \u201c5G\u201d means for RF exposure\n\n| Aspect | Typical frequency range | Typical power & field at ground | How it differs from earlier generations |\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Sub\u20116\u202fGHz (low\u2011band & mid\u2011band)** | 600\u202fMHz\u202f\u2013\u202f6\u202fGHz (e.g., 700\u202fMHz, 3.5\u202fGHz) | \u2264\u202f0.1\u202fW per carrier per sector; measured power\u2011density at street level usually <\u202f0.01\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2 (\u2248\u202f10\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2) | Same band as 2G\u20114G, but more carriers and beam\u2011forming. |\n| **mmWave (high\u2011band)** | 24\u202fGHz\u202f\u2013\u202f86\u202fGHz (most deployments 24\u201128\u202fGHz, 37\u201140\u202fGHz) | \u2264\u202f0.1\u202fW per carrier per sector; because of higher path loss, field at ground is typically **even lower** than sub\u20116\u202fGHz (often <\u202f0.001\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2). | Shorter wavelength \u2192 more directional antennas, rapid attenuation by foliage, rain, and even skin. |\n| **Beam\u2011forming / Massive MIMO** | Same frequencies, but antenna arrays steer narrow beams toward devices | The beam is **highly directional** and only points at a device for a few milliseconds at a time, so average exposure at any fixed point is very low. | Improves capacity, does not increase average ambient field. |\n\n*Bottom line:* Even though 5G uses higher frequencies and many more antennas, the **average power density that reaches the public from a tower is usually lower** than for 2G/3G/4G sites.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How health risk is evaluated\n\n| Step | What is done | Key reference |\n|------|--------------|---------------|\n| **1. Dosimetry** \u2013 measure or model the electric\u2011field (E) or power\u2011density (S) that a person could receive at ground level. | Field levels from real\u2011world 5G sites are typically **0.001\u20130.02\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2** (0.1\u20132\u202f\u00b5W\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2). | *ICNIRP 2020*; *FCC 2021*; *European Commission 2022* |\n| **2. Compare to safety limits** \u2013 limits are set to keep tissue heating (thermal effects) \u2264\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C and to avoid known non\u2011thermal mechanisms. | International limits for general public: 2\u202fW\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 (SAR) for frequencies <\u202f6\u202fGHz; 10\u202fW\u202fm\u207b\u00b2 (power\u2011density) for 6\u2011300\u202fGHz. | *ICNIRP 2020*; *IEEE C95.1\u20112020* |\n| **3. Review epidemiology** \u2013 look for associations between long\u2011term RF exposure and disease (cancer, reproduction, neurological outcomes). | The largest, most reliable studies (e.g., INTERPHONE, Danish cohort, Swedish cohort) **show no increased risk** for brain tumours or other cancers at exposures below limits. | *WHO (2023) \u2013 EMF Fact Sheet* |\n|",

They are the result of a **step\u2011by\u2011step risk\u2011assessment process** that combines (1) what we know about the *physical* interaction of radio\u2011frequency (RF) fields with biological tissue, (2) the *thresholds* at which measurable adverse effects appear in laboratory studies, and (3) a set of **safety (uncertainty) factors** that ensure the limits are well below any level that could plausibly cause harm to any member of the public, including the most vulnerable (children, pregnant women, people with implanted medical devices, etc.).\n\nBelow is a concise walk\u2011through of that process, with references to the two principal bodies that publish the limits today: **ICNIRP (International Commission on Non\u2011Ionising Radiation Protection)** and **IEEE/IEC** (the standards\u2011setting arm of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). The limits adopted by national regulators (FCC, Ofcom, BfS, etc.) are essentially identical to these international values.\n\n---\n\n### 1.
