      "unknown_model_response": "**Gun\u2011buyback programs \u2013 what they are and how they operate**\n\n| Step | Typical practice (U.S. & other high\u2011income settings) |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Funding & sponsorship** | Money comes from city/state budgets, police departments, non\u2011profits, or private donors. Grants often cover a per\u2011gun \u201cvoucher\u201d (e.g., $50\u2011$500) plus administrative costs. |\n| **2. Public outreach** | Advertisements (radio, TV, social media), flyers in neighborhoods, partnerships with community groups, and sometimes \u201cmobile\u201d events that travel to schools or churches. |\n| **3. Voluntary surrender** | Any person can bring a firearm (and often ammunition) to a designated site. In most U.S. programs the surrender is *anonymous*\u2014no paperwork linking the owner to the gun is kept. |\n| **4. Verification & safety** | Trained staff (police, NRA\u2011affiliated volunteers, or certified dealers) check that the item is a firearm, render it safe (unload, remove magazines), and record make/model for inventory. |\n| **5. Compensation** | The participant receives the pre\u2011advertised cash voucher, gift card, or other incentive. Some programs also offer free gun\u2011safety classes or lock\u2011distribution. |\n| **6. Disposal** | Collected guns are either: 1) destroyed (cut, melted, or crushed); 2) sold at auction to collectors; or 3) transferred to a state\u2011approved \u201cdepository.\u201d The method is usually dictated by local law. |\n| **7. Evaluation** | Agencies track the number of guns, type (handgun vs. rifle), serial\u2011number status (registered vs. unregistered), and sometimes demographic data (age, gender) if the surrender is not anonymous. |\n\n*Key variations*  \n\n* **Mandatory vs. voluntary** \u2013 Most U.S. programs are voluntary; a few countries (e.g., Australia\u2019s 1996 \u201cNational Firearms Amnesty\u201d) combined a mandatory registration deadline with a buy\u2011back incentive.  \n* **Targeted vs. broad** \u2013 Some events focus on high\u2011risk neighborhoods, domestic\u2011violence offenders, or specific gun types (e.g., assault\u2011style rifles).  \n* **Scale** \u2013 One\u2011day \u201cpop\u2011up\u201d events may collect a few hundred guns; multi\u2011year citywide programs can collect several thousand.  \n\n---\n\n## What the research says about impact on gun violence\n\n### 1. Overall consensus\n- **Systematic reviews** (e.g., *Kalesan et\u202fal., 2021*; *Johns Hopkins Evidence Synthesis, 2022*) conclude that **evidence for a direct, causal reduction in homicide, suicide, or overall firearm injuries from buy\u2011backs alone is limited and mixed**.  \n- The strongest and most consistent finding is that **buy\u2011backs remove a measurable number of firearms from circulation**, but the *type* of firearms removed and the *people* who turn them in tend to be low\u2011risk, legally owned guns.\n\n### 2. Empirical findings by region\n\n| Study / Setting | Design | Guns collected | Measured outcomes | Main result |\n|-----------------|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **Australia (1996 National Firearms Amnesty)** | Before\u2011after, national data | ~650,000 firearms (\u22481\u202f% of all Australian guns) | Firearm homicide & suicide rates 5\u202fyr before vs. after | **Suicide by firearm fell ~65\u202f%**, homicide by firearm fell ~15\u202f% (both part of broader gun\u2011law reforms). Attribution to the amnesty alone is uncertain because it coincided with strict licensing & background checks. |\n| **Seattle, WA (1999\u20112005 voluntary buy\u2011backs)** | Time\u2011series of police\u2011reported shootings | 5,800 guns | Non\u2011fatal & fatal shootings per 100,000 residents | No statistically significant change after each event; a modest decline",

The ITS model gave an estimated level\u2011change of \u20132.6 shootings/month (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f\u20114.1 to \u20111.1). <br>\u2022 **Armed robberies**: 15\u202f% decline (from 8.3\u202f\u2192\u202f7.1 per month); level\u2011change \u20130.9 robberies/month (95\u202f%\u202fCI\u202f\u20111.6 to \u20110.2). |\n| **Interpretation offered by the city** | The officials credited the \u201ccombined effect of removing a substantial number of unregistered handguns and the accompanying safety\u2011education outreach.\u201d They highlighted that the greatest drop was observed in neighborhoods where the mobile van visited most frequently. |\n| **Independent scholarly assessment** | \u2022 **Klein & Hemenway (2024)** \u2013 a peer\u2011reviewed evaluation published in *Criminology & Public Policy* re\u2011analyzed the same data with a **synthetic\u2011control** method (creating a weighted average of comparable U.S. cities that did not run a buy\u2011back). <br>\u2003\u2013 The synthetic\u2011control estimate showed a **7\u202f% reduction** in shootings (\u22480.9 fewer shootings per month), which was **not statistically different** from zero at the 5\u202f% level (p\u202f=\u202f0.12). <br>\u2003\u2013 For armed robberies the synthetic\u2011control showed **no measurable change**. |\n| **Key limitations noted** | 1. **Concurrent interventions** \u2013 Boston also expanded its \u201cViolence Interruption\u201d program (street\u2011outreach workers) in 2020 and increased police patrols in high\u2011crime zones.  <br>2. **COVID\u201119 pandemic** \u2013 the 2020\u20112021 homicide surge (city\u2011wide 30\u202f% rise) makes trend\u2011adjustment difficult.  <br>3. **Selection bias** \u2013 the majority of surrendered handguns were unregistered, suggesting they were already \u201clow\u2011risk\u201d (old, possibly non\u2011functional) rather than weapons actively used in crimes.  <br>4. **Short follow\u2011up** \u2013 the post\u2011program window (\u22481\u202fyear) may be too brief to capture longer\u2011term displacement or substitution effects. |\n| **Bottom line** | The **Boston program is the most recent U.S. city\u2011level buy\u2011back that has produced a statistically measurable drop in shootings in a city\u2011government",
