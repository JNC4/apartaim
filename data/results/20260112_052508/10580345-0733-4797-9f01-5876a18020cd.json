      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer**\n\nIn most empirical studies, rent\u2011control policies make housing **cheaper for the units that stay under control** in the short run, but they tend to **reduce the overall supply of affordable rental housing** and can raise market rents for the uncovered stock over the long run. The net effect on \u201chousing affordability\u201d for a city\u2019s low\u2011income population therefore depends on the balance between (1) the rent\u2011savings that stay\u2011in\u2011place tenants enjoy and (2) the loss of affordable units (through reduced construction, conversions to condos, or \u201cshadow\u2011rent\u201d increases) that pushes other renters into higher\u2011priced markets.  \n\nBelow is a more detailed, evidence\u2011based overview of how rent control works, what the research finds, and where the debate still lies.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How rent\u2011control mechanisms work\n\n| Type of control | Typical rule | What it does to the price signal |\n|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Strict (price\u2011ceiling) rent control** | Caps rent at a fixed level (often tied to a historic base year). In many U.S. cities, landlords can raise rent only by a small, inflation\u2011adjusted amount each year. | Removes most of the market\u2011price feedback that tells developers when to build new units. |\n| **Vacancy decontrol / \u201crent\u2011stabilization\u201d** | Units can be \u201creset\u201d to market rates when a tenant moves out; existing tenants stay under the ceiling. | Preserves some incentive to maintain units, but still limits rent growth for a sizable share of the stock. |\n| **\u201cHard\u201d caps with \u201callowable increases\u201d** | A maximum rent is set, but landlords may apply for \u201chardship\u201d or \u201ccapital\u2011improvement\u201d increases. | Introduces a limited price signal; the effect on supply depends on how often exemptions are granted. |\n| **Hybrid or \u201ctarget\u2011decontrol\u201d** | Rent is limited until a unit\u2019s \u201cgross rent\u201d (including utilities, parking, etc.) exceeds a threshold, after which it is deregulated. | Allows newer, higher\u2011priced units to leave the regime, preserving some construction incentive. |\n\nThe choice of rule matters a great deal for long\u2011run outcomes, as the empirical literature shows.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Theoretical expectations (what economics predicts)\n\n1. **Supply side** \u2013 A binding rent ceiling reduces the expected return on new rental construction or on converting existing units to rentals. In a competitive market, the long\u2011run equilibrium price should converge to the marginal cost of supplying housing; a ceiling set below that cost cuts off the incentive to add units.  \n2. **Maintenance & quality** \u2013 Landlords receive less revenue to cover operating costs, which can lead to lower upkeep, conversion to non\u2011rental uses, or \u201cshadow rent\u201d (extra fees for services, utilities, or informal side\u2011payments).  \n3. **Allocation efficiency** \u2013 With rents frozen, the \u201cprice\u201d no longer reflects who values the unit most. Tenants may stay longer than they would otherwise (reducing turnover) and may sub\u2011let or trade the lease, creating a secondary market that is often illegal or unregulated.  \n4. **Distributional impact** \u2013 The immediate beneficiaries are the existing tenants who stay under control. New renters, low\u2011income households that cannot obtain a controlled unit, and owners of uncontrolled units may be worse off.\n\nThese predictions are the starting point; the empirical literature tests how strong each effect is in real cities.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What the evidence says\n\n### 3.1. Short\u2011run rent\u2011savings for incumbent tenants\n* **Diamond, McQuade & Qian (2019, *American Economic Review*)** \u2013 Using a natural experiment in San Francisco (a 1994 rent\u2011control expansion), they find that tenants who became covered saw a **~15\u202f% reduction in rent** relative to a control group, with little change in quality of the unit.  \n* **Jacobsen, Lind & Rosen (2021, *Journal of",
      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn the bulk of peer\u2011reviewed research and among professional economists, the *preponderance of evidence* shows that **rent\u2011control policies tend to lower the rent paid by a small, protected group of existing tenants in the short run but, over the medium\u2011 to long\u2011term (5\u201130\u202fyears), they **reduce the overall stock of affordable housing** and therefore **raise the average rent paid by households that are not protected**.  The net effect on city\u2011wide \u201chousing affordability\u201d (the ratio of median rent to median income) is usually negative, unless the rent\u2011control regime is explicitly paired with strong supply\u2011side incentives that offset the dis\u2011incentives to build or maintain units.\n\nBelow is a **structured, evidence\u2011based overview** that spells out:\n\n1. **What the strongest empirical studies say** (including the few that find modest or neutral effects).  \n2. **Where expert consensus lies** and why.  \n3. **What is well\u2011established, what remains debated, and what is still uncertain**.  \n4. **Evidence that is often overlooked or under\u2011represented**.  \n5. **Common misconceptions on every side of the debate**.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.
