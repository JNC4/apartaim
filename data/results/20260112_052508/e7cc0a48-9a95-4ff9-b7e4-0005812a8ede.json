      "unknown_model_response": "**Safety\u2011related differences between raw milk and pasteurized milk**\n\n| Aspect | Raw Milk | Pasteurized Milk |\n|--------|----------|------------------|\n| **Microbial load** | Contains the natural microbiota from the cow (lactobacilli, yeasts, etc.) and any pathogens that may be present on the udder, in the environment, or in the milking equipment. The total bacterial count is generally higher. | Heat treatment (typically 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fseconds in high\u2011temperature short\u2011time pasteurization) reduces the total number of viable microorganisms by several log units, eliminating most common pathogens such as *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria monocytogenes*, and *Campylobacter*. |\n| **Enzyme activity** | Retains native enzymes (e.g., lipase, lactoperoxidase, alkaline phosphatase) that can aid digestion and may have antimicrobial effects in the gut. | Many heat\u2011sensitive enzymes are denatured or inactivated, which can alter the way the milk is processed by the digestive system. |\n| **Probiotic and beneficial bacteria** | Naturally occurring lactic\u2011acid bacteria and other microbes can contribute to a healthy gut microbiome when the milk is sourced from a clean, well\u2011managed herd. | The probiotic population is largely destroyed; any added cultures are usually introduced later (e.g., in yogurt or kefir production). |\n| **Nutrient profile** | Vitamins that are heat\u2011labile (such as vitamin\u202fC, some B\u2011vitamins, and certain antioxidant compounds) remain largely intact. | Some heat\u2011sensitive nutrients experience modest losses, although the overall macronutrient composition (protein, fat, lactose) is essentially unchanged. |\n| **Shelf life** | Higher microbial load shortens shelf life; raw milk typically remains fresh for a few days when kept chilled. | Reduced microbial load extends refrigerated shelf",
