Most reactions are mild and self\u2011limited (e.g., low\u2011grade fever, soreness at injection site). | CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink) analyses consistently find serious adverse events at rates \u2264\u202f1 per 100\u202f000 doses. |\n| **Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)** | Extremely rare; most occur within minutes\u2011hours after injection. | Approx. 1\u20132 cases per million vaccine doses (CDC, 2023). |\n| **Febrile seizures** (most often after measles\u2011mumps\u2011rubella (MMR) or combined DTaP\u2011IPV\u2011Hib) | Slightly increased risk after certain live\u2011virus vaccines, but the absolute risk remains <\u202f0.1\u202f% and seizures are usually brief, with no long\u2011term neurologic harm. | 1 per 3\u202f000\u20134\u202f000 MMR doses (Miller et\u202fal., *Pediatrics* 2020). |\n| **Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS)** | Small, statistically significant increase after some influenza vaccines (\u2248\u202f1\u20132 extra cases per million doses).

The 2019\u202f\u2013\u202f2020 Measles Resurgence in the United States  \n\n| Element | What happened | Why it mattered for herd immunity |\n|---------|---------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Baseline immunity before the outbreak** | By 2016, the U.S. had >\u202f92\u202f% two\u2011dose measles\u2011containing vaccine (MMR) coverage among children\u202f\u2265\u202f5\u202fy, which is just above the estimated herd\u2011immunity threshold for measles (\u2248\u202f93\u201195\u202f%). | At that level, measles transmission was *rare*: only a handful of imported cases each year, and they died out quickly. |\n| **Drop in coverage in specific pockets** | Certain counties and zip\u2011codes\u2014often in New York, New Jersey, California, and Washington\u2014had **MMR two\u2011dose coverage <\u202f80\u202f%**. The most notable \u201cpocket\u201d was the Orthodox\u2011Jewish community in **Rockland County, NY**, where 2018 coverage was ~\u202f71\u202f% (NY State Dept. of Health data). | Measles\u2019 basic reproduction number (**R\u2080**) is 12\u201118, meaning one infected person can, on average, infect 12\u201118 others in a fully susceptible population. With <\u202f80\u202f% coverage, the effective reproduction number (**R\u2091**) jumps above\u202f1, allowing sustained spread. |\n| **Trigger event** | An unvaccinated traveler from Israel (where a large measles outbreak was occurring) visited the community in late 2018. | The virus entered a *local* population that lacked the herd\u2011immunity \u201cfirewall.\u201d |\n| **Outbreak size** | - **Total cases (U.S., 2019\u20112020)**: 1,282 confirmed measles cases \u2013 the largest number since 1992. <br>- **Rockland County alone**: 58 cases, 30\u202f% of the county\u2019s children aged 1\u20114\u202fy were unvaccinated. <br>- **Other clusters**: 4\u2011state outbreak linked to a traveler from Ukraine (\u2248\u202f200 cases). | The outbreak spread quickly within the under\u2011immunized pockets but *did not* become nationwide because most of the country still had >\u202f90\u202f% coverage, which halted further transmission. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | \u2022 Emergency orders requiring proof of MMR vaccination for school entry (NY\u202fS\u202fDept.\u202fof\u202fHealth, 2019). <br>\u2022 Mobile vaccination clinics, targeted outreach, and media campaigns. <br>\u2022 Rapid contact\u2011tracing and isolation of cases. | These actions raised two\u2011dose coverage in the affected zip\u2011codes from ~\u202f71\u202f% to >\u202f90\u202f% within a few months. |\n| **Result after the response** | No new measles cases were reported in the affected communities after May\u202f2020, and the overall U.S. measles case count fell back to the historic baseline (\u2248\u202f10\u201120 cases per year). | Once the local herd\u2011immunity threshold was restored, the virus could no longer sustain transmission. |\n\n### Key Take\u2011aways from the Measles Example\n| Point | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Herd\u2011immunity threshold (HIT) is disease\u2011specific** | Measles, with a very high R\u2080 (12\u201118), needs **\u2248\u202f93\u201195\u202f%** of a population immune (usually by two\u2011dose MMR) to keep R\u2091\u202f<\u202f1. Diseases with lower R\u2080 (e.g., pertussis, R\u2080\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u201112) need a lower but still substantial threshold. |\n| **\u201cPockets\u201d matter more than national averages** | Even if a country\u2019s overall coverage is >\u202f90\u202f%, a **local cluster** below the HIT can become the spark for an outbreak. The disease can then spread to neighboring areas that are also under\u2011immunized. |\n| **Outbreaks are often \u201cimported\u201d** | Most U.S. measles cases in the modern era are imported from abroad. The *importation* itself isn\u2019t the problem; the problem is the lack",

They also obtained *community\u2011trust credentials* (e.g., letters of support from local religious leaders). |\n| **Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) & community health clinics** | Provided the physical sites (e.g., community\u2011center rooms, church basements) and on\u2011site clinical staff (nurses, nurse\u2011practitioners, pharmacists). |\n| **Non\u2011profit outreach groups (e.g., United Way, Jewish Community Relations Council, Muslim\u2011American Advocacy groups)** | Ran door\u2011to\u2011door canvassing, translated materials, and helped schedule appointments for families who did not have reliable phone or internet access. |\n| **State immunization information systems (IIS, e.g., NYSIIS, ImmunizeCA)** | Supplied real\u2011time \u201ccoverage dashboards\u201d that showed, at the zip\u2011code level, the number of children who were 0\u2011dose, 1\u2011dose, or 2\u2011dose. The dashboards were updated nightly and guided where the next mobile unit should park. |\n| **Emergency\u2011response contractors (e.g., vaccine\u2011distribution logistics firms)** | Delivered the cold\u2011chain\u2011validated vaccine shipments to the mobile units each morning, using refrigerated vans equipped with temperature\u2011monitoring data loggers (required by CDC\u2019s Vaccine Storage and Handling guidelines). |\n| **CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office (ISO)** | Provided technical assistance on consent forms, adverse\u2011event monitoring, and post\u2011vaccination observation protocols (15\u2011minute on\u2011site monitoring for all children; 30\u202fminutes for those with a history of severe allergy). |\n\n**Key logistical note:**  \nAll mobile units were *self\u2011contained*\u2014they carried their own refrigeration unit, sharps containers, electronic tablets for real\u2011time entry into the state IIS, and a battery\u2011back\u2011up power source.
