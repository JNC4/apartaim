No human exposure yet. |\n| **Phase\u202fI (first\u2011in\u2011human)** | \u2022 Small group of healthy adults (often 20\u2011100) receives the vaccine. <br>\u2022 Primary focus: safety, tolerability, and a basic look at immune response (antibody titers). | Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) + FDA/EMA/Health Canada review of the trial protocol. | Several months. |\n| **Phase\u202fII (dose\u2011finding & expanded safety)** | \u2022 Hundreds of participants, including the target age group (e.g., toddlers). <br>\u2022 Compare several doses, schedule options, and collect more detailed safety data (local reactions, fever, lab tests). | Same oversight as Phase\u202fI; Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) review interim data. | 6\u201312\u202fmonths. |\n| **Phase\u202fIII (large\u2011scale efficacy & safety)** | \u2022 Thousands to tens of thousands of children (often 2\u202f\u2013\u202f30\u202f% of the population in a country). <br>\u2022 Randomized, double\u2011blind, placebo\u2011controlled (or active\u2011control) design. <br>\u2022 Primary endpoints: prevention of disease (clinical cases) and serious adverse events. | FDA\u202f/\u202fEMA\u202f/\u202fWHO pre\u2011qualification; DSMB; IRBs.

The same basic framework applies to every modern childhood vaccine, but the MMR story is useful because it spans the classic \u201clive\u2011attenuated\u201d technology, a large\u2011scale Phase\u202fIII trial, and decades of post\u2011licensure surveillance that have identified both common and very rare adverse events.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Pre\u2011clinical work (1950s\u20111960s)\n\n| Activity | What was done | Outcome |\n|----------|--------------|---------|\n| Virus isolation & attenuation | Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and later at Merck isolated wild\u2011type measles, mumps, and rubella viruses and passed them many times through cell cultures or animal embryos to weaken (attenuate) them. | Strains that replicated enough to stimulate immunity but caused only mild or no disease in animals. |\n| Toxicology studies | Mice, rats, and non\u2011human primates received high\u2011dose inoculations to look for organ toxicity, neuro\u2011behavioural changes, and reproductive effects. | No signal for serious toxicity; the attenuated viruses were cleared after a few days. |\n\n*All animal work was reviewed by the NIH\u2019s Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the 1966 Animal Welfare Act (the precursor to today\u2019s IACUC system).*\n\n---\n\n## 2.

No serious adverse events (SAEs). |\n| **Phase\u202fII (1970\u20111971)** | Randomized, double\u2011blind, three\u2011arm study: (1) measles\u2011only, (2) mumps\u2011only, (3) combined MMR. | 300 children aged 12\u201115\u202fmonths. | Seroconversion rates >\u202f95\u202f% for all three viruses. Reactogenicity similar to that of the separate monovalent vaccines. |\n\nThese studies were overseen by the **NIH Institutional Review Board** and by the **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**, which required a formal **Investigational New Drug (IND)** application.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
