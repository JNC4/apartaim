      "user_message": "How do economic sanctions typically influence the behavior or policies of the countries they target?",
      "unknown_model_response": "**Short answer:**  \nEconomic sanctions can sometimes persuade a target government to change a specific policy, but they succeed only under a fairly narrow set of conditions. In many cases they produce limited diplomatic leverage while inflicting significant economic pain on ordinary people and on the sanction\u2011imposing states themselves. The overall \u201ctrack\u2011record\u201d is mixed, and scholars still debate how to measure success, what mechanisms matter most, and when sanctions are counter\u2011productive.\n\nBelow is a\u202f*comprehensive*\u202f overview that brings together the most robust evidence, the main arguments on each side, points of scholarly consensus, and the areas where the data are still ambiguous.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What are \u201ceconomic sanctions\u201d?\n\n| **Type** | **Typical tools** | **Intended target** |\n|----------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Comprehensive (or \u201ctrade\u201d) sanctions** | Broad embargoes on imports/exports, financial isolation, travel bans | Entire economy of the target state |\n| **Targeted (or \u201csmart\u201d) sanctions** | Asset freezes, travel bans on elite individuals and firms, sector\u2011specific export controls (e.g., arms, dual\u2011use tech) | Decision\u2011makers and revenue\u2011generating sectors |\n| **Secondary sanctions** | Penalties for third\u2011party firms that do business with the primary target | Companies in neutral/third\u2011party states |\n| **Financial\u2011sector sanctions** | SWIFT bans, restrictions on sovereign debt markets, limits on bank correspondent relationships | Access to international finance |\n\nThe distinction matters because the **mechanism of influence** differs: comprehensive sanctions aim to create macro\u2011economic distress that forces a government to concede; targeted sanctions try to change the calculus of the ruling elite without hurting the broader population.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Theoretical pathways by which sanctions can change behavior\n\n| **Pathway** | **How it works** | **Key assumptions** |\n|-------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| **Economic cost\u2011benefit pressure** | Sanctions raise the price of continuing the objectionable policy (e.g., loss of export revenue, higher inflation, debt service problems). The regime calculates that the cost outweighs the political gain. | \u2013 The regime cares about economic welfare (or at least about elite wealth). <br>\u2013 There are credible alternatives (e.g., policy reversal, negotiation). |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | Economic hardship fuels public protests or elite dissent, which the leadership cannot ignore. | \u2013 Civil society is not heavily repressed, or elites have channels to express dissent. |\n| **International isolation** | Sanctions reduce diplomatic legitimacy, limit access to technology, and make future trade/aid harder. | \u2013 The target values international status or needs external technology. |\n| **Signaling and bargaining** | Sanctions serve as a \u201ccostly signal\u201d that the imposer is serious, prompting the target to negotiate before costs become intolerable. | \u2013 Both sides can credibly observe each other\u2019s costs and intentions. |\n| **Regime consolidation** | Paradoxically, sanctions can rally nationalist sentiment, allowing the leadership to blame external enemies and tighten control. | \u2013 The regime has strong coercive capacity and a narrative of external threat. |\n\nThese pathways are not mutually exclusive; a single sanction episode often activates several at once.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  What the empirical literature says\n\n### 3.1.  Meta\u2011analyses and aggregate findings  \n\n| Study (year) | Sample & method | Main quantitative result | Interpretation |\n|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott \u2013 *Economic Sanctions Reconsidered* (2007, 2nd ed. 2020)** | 221 sanction cases (1945\u20112005); logistic regression on \u201cpolicy change\u201d vs. \u201cno change\u201d. | **\u2248 34\u202f%** of cases achieved the stated policy objective; success rose to **\u2248 54\u202f%** when the target was a **democracy** and the sanction was **targeted**. | Sanctions are *more likely* to work when they are precise, when the target has internal political competition, and when the sanctioner\u2019s objectives are modest. |\n| **Kaempfer & Lowenberg (2020, *Journal of Conflict Resolution*)** | Event\u2011study of 85 U.S. sanctions (1992\u20112015). | Each additional sanction\u2011type reduced the probability of target compliance by **",

A \u201csuccess\u201d story \u2013 **South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime (mid\u20111980s\u202f\u2192\u202f1990)**  \n\n### 1.1.  What the sanctions looked like  \n\n| **Sanctioning coalition** | **Key instruments** | **Scope** |\n|----------------------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| United Nations (Resolution\u202f418, 1977) \u2192 later reinforced by the **U.S., U.K., EU, Canada, Australia, Japan** | \u2022 Arms embargo  <br>\u2022 Ban on imports of South\u2011African gold, diamonds, and other minerals  <br>\u2022 Restrictions on new foreign investment  <br>\u2022 Travel bans on senior officials  <br>\u2022 Disinvestment campaigns by pension funds, universities, churches | **Hybrid** \u2013 a **comprehensive trade embargo** on strategic goods **plus** a **targeted \u201csmart\u201d campaign** that froze assets, barred travel, and pressured private investors. |\n\n*The sanctions were not a single legal act but a coordinated mix of UN mandates, national legislation, and a massive civil\u2011society\u2011driven \u201cdisinvestment\u201d movement.*\n\n### 1.2.  How the mechanisms operated  \n\n| **Mechanism** | **Evidence of it working** |\n|---------------|----------------------------|\n| **Economic cost\u2011benefit pressure** | By the early 1990s South Africa\u2019s **foreign\u2011exchange reserves fell from \u2248\u202fUS$22\u202fbn (1979) to \u2248\u202fUS$4\u202fbn (1990)**; the **rand depreciated sharply**, inflation topped 20\u202f% (1990). The loss of **gold and diamond export earnings** (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of export revenue) forced the government to seek new markets and to cut public spending. |\n| **Domestic political pressure** | The sanctions amplified internal dissent: **mass strikes, student protests, and union actions** grew, partly because workers lost income and feared a prolonged recession. The **African National Congress (ANC)** used the sanctions narrative to argue that \u201cthe world is on our side,\u201d increasing its legitimacy. |\n| **International isolation & signaling** | South Africa was expelled from the **Commonwealth (1992)** and faced a cultural\u2011sports boycott (e.g., the 1976 Olympic boycott). This **status loss** mattered to the ruling National Party, which had built its legitimacy on being a \u201crespectable\u201d modern state. |\n| **Elite cost\u2011sharing** | The **sanctions targeted the mining sector**, where many National\u2011Party elites held stakes. Asset freezes and the loss of export licences directly hit the personal wealth of the ruling class, creating **intra\u2011elite friction**. |\n\n### 1.3.  Outcome  \n\n| **Policy change** | **Timeline** | **Why scholars label it a success** |\n|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Dismantling of apartheid legislation** (e.g., repeal of the Population Registration Act, release of Nelson Mandela) and **transition to multiracial democracy** (1994 elections). | 1986\u20111994 | - **Causal\u2011link studies** (e.g., Hufbauer et\u202fal., 2007; Kotsadam & Sahlberg, *World Development* 2020) find a statistically significant correlation between the timing of sanctions and the acceleration of negotiations. <br>- **Process tracing** (e.g., Robinson, *Political Science Quarterly* 1997) shows that the **combined economic squeeze and elite cost\u2011sharing** shifted the National Party\u2019s cost\u2011benefit calculus: continued apartheid became more costly than negotiated reform. |\n| **Secondary effects** | The sanctions also **stimulated internal reforms** (e.g., limited liberalisation of the financial sector) that made the transition smoother. | |\n\n### 1.4.  Key take\u2011aways for why it worked  \n\n| Factor | How it matched the \u201csuccess\u201d conditions identified in the academic literature |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Targeted\u2011plus\u2011comprehensive design** | The",
