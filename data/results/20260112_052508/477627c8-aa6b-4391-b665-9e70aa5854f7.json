The evidence is strongest for **colorectal cancer** and is supported by many large prospective cohort studies. | About **18\u202f% higher colorectal\u2011cancer risk** for people who eat ~50\u202fg of processed meat daily (\u22482\u202f\u2013\u202f3 slices of bacon) compared with those who eat none. The absolute increase is \u2248\u202f5\u201310 extra cases per 100\u202f000 people per year. | \u2022 Limit processed meat to \u2264\u202f50\u202fg\u202f/day (or replace with poultry, fish, legumes).<br>\u2022 Choose \u201cunprocessed\u201d red meat (steak, ground beef, lamb) in moderation (\u2264\u202f100\u2013150\u202fg\u202f/day). |\n| **Unprocessed red meat** (beef, pork, lamb, veal, goat) is classified by IARC as **\u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d** (Group\u202f2A).  The link is weaker and mainly driven by colorectal cancer, with possible signals for pancreatic and prostate cancer. | Roughly **10\u202f% higher colorectal\u2011cancer risk** for an intake of 100\u202fg cooked red meat per day versus none.  This translates to \u2248\u202f3\u20135 extra cases per 100\u202f000 people per year.  The association is dose\u2011responsive but the confidence intervals are wide. | \u2022 Aim for \u2264\u202f100\u202fg cooked portion (\u2248\u202f3\u20114\u202foz) a few times per week.<br>\u2022 Favor lean cuts, trim visible fat, and use cooking methods that generate fewer harmful chemicals (see below). |\n| **No clear causal link** has been proven for many other cancers (breast, ovarian, lung, etc.).  The evidence is inconsistent and often confounded by lifestyle factors. | The relative risk for most non\u2011colorectal cancers is **\u2264\u202f1.1\u20131.2** (i.e., 10\u201120\u202f% higher) and many studies show no association. | \u2022 Focus on overall dietary pattern (more plant foods, fiber, whole grains) which consistently lowers cancer risk. |\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the evidence is built  \n\n| Study type | What it tells us | Strengths | Limitations |\n|------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| **Prospective cohort studies** (e.g., EPIC, NIH\u2011AARP, Nurses\u2019 Health Study) | Follow millions of people over 10\u201120\u202fyears, recording diet and cancer outcomes. Consistently show higher colorectal\u2011cancer rates with higher processed\u2011meat intake and a weaker trend for unprocessed meat. | Large sample sizes, ability to adjust for many confounders (smoking, BMI, fiber, etc.). | Observational \u2192 cannot prove causation; diet is self\u2011reported (measurement error). |\n| **Case\u2011control studies** | Compare past meat consumption of people with cancer vs. cancer\u2011free controls. Often find similar patterns to cohorts. | Useful for rare cancers. | Recall bias (cases may over\u2011report \u201cbad\u201d foods); selection bias. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses & pooled analyses** (e.g., World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 2018, 2022 updates) | Combine data from many studies to increase statistical power. Show a **dose\u2011response**: ~1\u20112\u202f% increase in colorectal\u2011cancer risk per 10\u202fg of processed meat. | More precise estimates; can explore heterogeneity. | Quality depends on included studies; publication bias can inflate effects. |\n| **Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)** | Few exist because it is unethical to assign long\u2011term high\u2011risk diets. The **U.S. Dietary Patterns RCT** (e.g., the \u201cWomen's Health Initiative\u201d dietary modification trial) showed modest reductions in cancer incidence when participants reduced",

How the evidence is organised\n\n| Evidence type | What it can tell us | Typical strengths / limits |\n|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| **International agency assessments** (e.g., IARC, WHO) | Systematic appraisal of all available epidemiology, mechanistic, and animal data; assign a *probability* of carcinogenicity. | Relies on the quality of the underlying studies; \u201cprobable carcinogen\u201d does **not** mean \u201chigh risk\u201d. |\n| **Prospective cohort studies** (large, long\u2011term follow\u2011up of >100\u202fk participants) | Direct observation of diet \u2192 cancer outcomes in real\u2011world settings; can estimate dose\u2011response. | Observational \u2192 possible residual confounding; dietary intake measured by food\u2011frequency questionnaires (FFQs) has measurement error. |\n| **Meta\u2011analyses / pooled analyses** of cohorts | Combine many cohorts to increase power; allow exploration of heterogeneity (e.g., by region, cancer site). | Same limitations as the underlying cohorts; publication bias can affect results. |\n| **Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)** (e.g., diet\u2011intervention trials) | Gold\u2011standard for causality, but very few have cancer incidence as a primary outcome because cancer takes decades to develop. | Usually small, short\u2011term, or focus on intermediate biomarkers rather than actual cancer cases. |\n| **Mechanistic / animal studies** | Show whether chemicals formed in meat (e.g., heterocyclic amines, N\u2011nitroso compounds) can cause DNA damage or tumours. | Translating dose and exposure from animals to humans is uncertain. |\n| **Mendelian\u2011randomisation (MR) studies** | Use genetic variants that influence meat consumption to infer causality while avoiding confounding. | Still early; limited power; assumptions about the genetic instrument may be violated. |\n\n---\n\n## 2.
