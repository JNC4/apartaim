In a few countries (e.g., Australia, New\u202fZealand) the national government coordinates the effort. | Some programs are run by non\u2011government NGOs that partner with police. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | \u2011\u202fResidents bring firearms (and sometimes ammunition) to a designated drop\u2011off site. <br>\u2011\u202fPolice officers may go door\u2011to\u2011door in neighborhoods with high\u2011risk profiles. | \u201cAmnesty\u201d models allow anonymous drop\u2011offs (no paperwork, no questions). \u201cExchange\u201d models give a voucher that must be redeemed at a participating retailer. |\n| **What do participants get?** | Cash (often $50\u2011$500 per gun), gift cards, vouchers, or non\u2011monetary items (e.g., a \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d tote). The amount can be flat per gun or scale with caliber/condition. | Some programs pair the incentive with free safety\u2011training or free lock\u2011boxes. |\n| **Which guns are accepted?** | Almost any firearm that can be legally possessed \u2013 pistols, rifles, shotguns, \u201cassault\u2011style\u201d weapons, and sometimes \u201cnon\u2011functioning\u201d guns (e.g., replicas). | Certain jurisdictions exclude firearms that are currently registered to the owner (e.g., a police\u2011issued weapon) or that are illegal to possess. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | 1. **Deactivation / destruction** \u2013 hammer\u2011driven crushing, melting, or shredding. <br>2. **Re\u2011sale to collectors** (rare, usually only antique or historically significant pieces). | In Australia and New\u202fZealand, the law requires permanent destruction; in the U.S. the process is often left to the local law\u2011enforcement agency\u2019s standard evidence\u2011disposal protocol. |\n| **Is participation mandatory?** | **No** \u2013 most U.S. programs are strictly voluntary.  <br>In contrast, Australia\u2019s 1996 reforms required owners to surrender prohibited firearms or face criminal penalties; the \u201cbuy\u2011back\u201d portion was voluntary but heavily incentivised. | Mandatory surrender programs exist in a handful of countries (e.g., post\u2011conflict disarmament in Bosnia, Rwanda), but they are not the typical \u201cbuy\u2011back\u201d model discussed in the U.S. literature. |\n| **Funding source** | Municipal budgets, state grants, federal \u201cCommunity Policing\u201d funds, or private donations. | In Australia the federal government paid\u202fA$1.5\u202fbillion (\u2248US\u202f$1\u202fbillion) for the 1996 buy\u2011back; New\u202fZealand spent NZ$30\u202fmillion for its 2020\u201121 program. |\n\n### Typical timeline of a U.S. city buy\u2011back\n\n1. **Planning (3\u201112\u202fmonths)** \u2013 outreach to community groups, securing a venue, setting the incentive schedule, arranging a safe\u2011disposal contractor.  \n2. **Publicity** \u2013 press releases, flyers, social\u2011media ads, radio spots, and often a \u201ccelebration\u201d event (e.g., live music) to encourage turnout.  \n3. **Collection day(s)** \u2013",

The exact locations were: <br>\u2022 **South\u2011East District Community Center** (near the Rainier Valley) <br>\u2022 **Northgate Police Precinct parking lot** (North Seattle) <br>\u2022 **East\u2011Side (Lake City) community park** | By placing the drop\u2011off inside or next to a community hub, the department reduced transportation barriers for residents who might not travel downtown. |\n| **Staffing** | Each site had **2 sworn officers**, **1 civilian evidence\u2011technician**, and **2 volunteers** from local \u201cFriends of the Police\u201d groups.  A **mobile shredding unit** (a portable hydraulic crusher) was parked on\u2011site to destroy firearms immediately, which helped reassure participants that the guns would be \u201cgone for good.\u201d | Visible police presence built trust and deterred \u201cshow\u2011up\u201d of illegal weapons that might be used as a bargaining chip. |\n| **Hours & publicity** | Operated **Saturday & Sunday, 10\u202fa.m.\u20136\u202fp.m.**, for **four consecutive days** at each location (total of 12\u202fdays).  Prior to each weekend the SPD ran **hyper\u2011local flyers, door\u2011to\u2011door canvassing by community\u2011outreach officers, and targeted ads on the neighborhood Facebook groups**. | Weekend hours matched when most residents were off work; repeated days gave people who missed the first weekend a second chance. |\n| **Incentive structure** | Same as the city\u2011wide event: **$500 per handgun**, **$250 per rifle/shotgun**, **$100 per other firearm** (including \u201cair guns\u201d and \u201creplicas\u201d).  The SPD also offered a **$25 \u201csafety\u2011kit\u201d voucher** (containing a lockbox and a free NRA\u2011approved safety course) for anyone who turned in **two or more firearms**. | The extra voucher was a modest nudge to encourage families or households that might have several guns. |\n| **Legal safeguards** | Participants were asked to **fill out a short, anonymous questionnaire** (no name, no address).  The form captured:  <br>\u2022 Type of firearm (caliber, action) <br>\u2022 Approximate acquisition year <br>\u2022 Reason for surrender (e.g., \u201cno longer needed,\u201d \u201cconcern about safety\u201d).  <br>All data were stored **separately from the evidence chain\u2011of\u2011custody** to protect anonymity. | Anonymity is crucial for \u201camnesty\u201d buy\u2011backs; it reduces fear of self\u2011incrimination and encourages turn\u2011ins of **unregistered** weapons. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
