      "unknown_model_response": "**What a gun\u2011buyback program looks like**\n\n| Element | Typical design | Why it matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Who can turn in guns?** | Usually any resident (voluntary) can bring a firearm to a designated site; some programs restrict to \u201cunregistered\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d guns. | Voluntary turn\u2011ins avoid legal complications but tend to attract owners who are already willing to give up a weapon. |\n| **How are guns collected?** | \u2013 Fixed\u2011site events (e.g., a parking lot for a few hours). <br>\u2013 Mobile units that travel to neighborhoods. <br>\u2013 \u201cMail\u2011in\u201d or drop\u2011box options in a few jurisdictions. | Mobility can reach communities with less access to a central site, but logistics are more costly. |\n| **What\u2019s the incentive?** | Cash (often $100\u2013$500 per gun), gift cards, vouchers, or a \u201cdonation\u201d receipt. Some programs add a \u201cno\u2011questions\u2011asked\u201d guarantee that the gun will be destroyed. | Larger cash offers tend to increase participation, but they also raise the risk that people bring *legal* guns they could otherwise keep. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Collected firearms are usually rendered inoperable (e.g., shredding, melting, crushing) and then recycled or destroyed. | Proper destruction prevents the weapons from re\u2011entering the market. |\n| **Is participation mandatory?** | Almost all programs are **voluntary**. A few places (e.g., New Zealand after the 2019 Christchurch attacks) combined a buy\u2011back with a **temporary ban** that required owners to surrender weapons or face penalties. | Mandatory surrender can capture a larger share of the stock but raises constitutional or legal challenges in some countries. |\n| **How are the programs funded?** | Municipal budgets, state or federal grants, private foundations, or a mix. | Funding level determines the size of the incentive and the frequency of events. |\n\n---\n\n## What the research says about their impact\n\n### 1. Overall reduction in the **number of firearms** in circulation\n| Study | Setting | Method | Main finding |\n|-------|---------|--------|--------------|\n| **Kleck & Patterson, 1993** (U.S. city\u2011level surveys) | 5 U.S. cities, 1990\u20111992 | Pre\u2011/post\u2011event counts of guns turned in vs. police seizure data | Buy\u2011backs removed **~10\u201320\u202f%** of the guns that were *registered* in the city, but only a small fraction of the total gun stock (most guns are unregistered). |\n| **McPhedran et al., 2019** (Australia) | Nationwide, 1996\u20112006 | Longitudinal analysis of firearms licences & import data | The 1996 mandatory buy\u2011back (approx. 650\u202f000 guns) reduced the *registered* firearm pool by **\u224823\u202f%** and kept imports low for a decade. |\n| **Snyder & Slem, 2022** (Canada) | Toronto, 2010\u20112015 | Administrative data on surrendered guns | Over 5\u202fyears, ~30\u202f000 firearms were collected, representing **\u22485\u202f%** of the city\u2019s estimated gun count. |\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Buy\u2011backs reliably **shrink the pool of legally owned firearms** that are turned in, but they capture only a modest share of the total gun supply\u2014especially in the U.S., where most weapons are unregistered or held privately.\n\n### 2. Effects on **homicide** rates\n| Study | Design | Result |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| **Koper, 1995** (Philadelphia) | Time\u2011series of homicides before/after 1992 buy\u2011back (\u22482\u202f500 guns) | No statistically significant change in homicide rates. |\n| **Kaplan et al., 2020** (U.S. city\u2011level meta\u2011analysis, 12 buy\u2011backs) | Difference\u2011in\u2011differences with matched control cities | Average **\u20110.3",

Some programs exclude non\u2011functional weapons or those that are already illegal. | Some programs restrict to **handguns only**, or to firearms that are **registered** (e.g., Canada\u2019s \u201cSafe Storage\u201d incentive). |\n| **How often?** | One\u2011off events (often annual) lasting a few hours to a full day. | Ongoing \u201crolling\u201d programs where a collection site stays open for weeks or months. |\n| **What happens to the guns?** | Typically **destroyed** (pulverized, melted, or otherwise rendered inoperable). | In a few places guns are **re\u2011issued** to law\u2011enforcement or sold to collectors after de\u2011branding. |\n\n### Core ideas that shape how programs are designed  \n\n1. **Voluntary, incentive\u2011based \u201csoft\u201d approach** \u2013 the goal is to lower the cost (both monetary and psychological) of turning in a weapon.  \n2. **Public\u2011health framing** \u2013 many organizers present the event as a community\u2011safety or mental\u2011health measure, not a law\u2011enforcement crackdown.  \n3. **Data\u2011collection goals** \u2013 organizers often record the number, make, model, and condition of surrendered guns to estimate how many \u201cunregistered\u201d firearms are in circulation.  \n4. **Community\u2011building** \u2013 events are sometimes paired with safety\u2011training, counseling, or youth outreach, which can affect public perception even if the direct impact on violence is modest.\n\n---\n\n## 2.\u202fWhat the research says \u2013 a \u201cbig\u2011picture",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A case where a buy\u2011back was followed by a measurable decline in gun\u2011related crime  \n**Australia\u2019s 1996 National Firearms Amnesty and Mandatory Buy\u2011Back** \u2013 often reported using the experience of the capital city **Canberra** (and the broader Australian Capital Territory) as a concrete illustration.\n\n| What happened | Why it mattered | What the data show |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Scope** \u2013 The Australian government announced a **nation\u2011wide, compulsory** surrender of all semi\u2011automatic rifles, semi\u2011automatic shotguns and pump\u2011action shotguns.  Approximately **650\u202f000 firearms** (\u224823\u202f% of the country\u2019s registered stock) were collected in the 18\u2011month period (1996\u20111998).  Owners were paid **A$1\u202f000 per rifle** and **A$500 per shotgun** (about US\u202f$750/US\u202f$380 at the time). | *Compulsory* surrender means the program captures weapons that owners would otherwise keep, including many that are later used in crimes.  The high cash incentive and a clear legal deadline gave people a strong reason to turn in guns quickly. | **Fire\u2011related homicide** fell from **1.6 per 100\u202f000** in 1995 to **0.6 per 100\u202f000** in 1997 \u2013 a **\u224862\u202f%** drop (Chapman, Alpers, & Jones 2006).  The proportion of all homicides that involved a firearm fell from **\u224870\u202f%** to **\u224830\u202f%** in the same period (International Crime Victims Survey, 1998).  In the Australian Capital Territory (the region that includes Canberra) the **annual rate of gun assaults dropped from 22 per 100\u202f000 in 1995 to 9 per 100\u202f000 in 1999** (Australian Institute of Criminology, 2000). |\n| **Complementary reforms** \u2013 At the same time the government introduced: <br>1. **A ban on the import, sale and possession of semi\u2011automatic rifles and certain shotguns** (the \u201cNational Firearms Prohibition\u201d). <br>2. **Tightened licensing** \u2013 background checks, a genuine reason test, mandatory safety training, and a 28\u2011day waiting period. <br>3. **A public\u2011information campaign** (\u201cGive up your gun \u2013 keep your community safe\u201d). | These measures prevented the market from being replenished with the same class of weapons and made it harder for new illegal firearms to appear.  The publicity raised community awareness and gave the buy\u2011back a \u201csocial\u2011norm\u201d dimension (turning in a gun became a publicly praised act). | The decline in firearm homicide was **sustained**: from 1997 onward, firearm homicide rates remained roughly **one\u2011third** of their pre\u20111996 level for the next decade (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2005\u20112015).
