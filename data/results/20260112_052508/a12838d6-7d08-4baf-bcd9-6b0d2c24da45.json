      "unknown_model_response": "### How Vaccines Protect Children\n\nVaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens\u2014bacteria or viruses\u2014without causing the disease itself. Here\u2019s a step\u2011by\u2011step look at what happens when a child receives a vaccine:\n\n| Step | What Happens | Why It Matters |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **1. Introduction of an antigen** | The vaccine contains a harmless piece of the germ (e.g., a protein, a sugar coat, or a dead/inactivated version of the microbe). | The immune system sees this \u201cpreview\u201d and knows it\u2019s something to watch for. |\n| **2. Activation of immune cells** | Dendritic cells capture the antigen and travel to lymph nodes, where they present it to T\u2011cells and B\u2011cells. | This kick\u2011starts the adaptive immune response, the part of immunity that \u201cremembers\u201d specific threats. |\n| **3. Production of antibodies** | B\u2011cells differentiate into plasma cells that churn out antibodies specifically designed to bind the antigen. | Antibodies can neutralize the real pathogen if the child is later exposed, preventing infection or reducing severity. |\n| **4. Development of memory cells** | Some activated T\u2011 and B\u2011cells become long\u2011lived memory cells. | These cells remain on standby for years (or a lifetime), allowing a rapid, robust response on re\u2011exposure. |\n| **5. Rapid response on real exposure** | If the child later encounters the actual disease\u2011causing organism, memory cells recognize it instantly, producing large amounts of antibodies and coordinating other defenses. | The infection is often stopped before symptoms develop, or it is much milder than it would be without vaccination. |\n\n#### Example: The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine\n\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Target diseases** | Measles, mumps, rubella\u2014each highly contagious viral illnesses that can cause severe complications (pneumonia, encephalitis, congenital rubella syndrome). |\n| **How it works** | The MMR vaccine contains live\u2011attenuated (weakened) viruses that replicate just enough to stimulate immunity but are too weak to cause disease in healthy children. |\n| **Immune response** | After the first dose (usually at 12\u201315\u202fmonths), the body makes antibodies against each virus. A second dose (4\u20136\u202fyears) boosts those antibody levels, ensuring long\u2011term protection. |\n| **Impact** | In the United States, widespread MMR vaccination has reduced measles cases from hundreds of thousands per year in the 1960s to just a handful of outbreaks today. Similar drops are seen for mumps and rubella. |\n\n### Common Side Effects\n\nMost side effects are mild, short\u2011lived, and far less serious than the diseases they prevent. Below is a summary of typical reactions by vaccine type.\n\n| Vaccine | Common Local Reactions | Common Systemic Reactions | Frequency |\n|---------|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|\n| **DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis)** | Soreness, redness, swelling at injection site | Fever (up to 38\u202f\u00b0C), fussiness, sleepiness | Local: 1\u20112\u202fdays in ~30\u201140\u202f% of kids; Fever: ~10\u201115\u202f% |\n| **MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)** | Mild rash, soreness at injection site | Low\u2011grade fever, mild rash, swollen glands | Rash/fever: ~5\u201110\u202f% |\n| **Polio (IPV)** | Soreness, redness | Mild fever, irritability | Soreness: ~20\u201130\u202f%; Fever: <10\u202f% |\n| **Hepatitis\u202fB** | Soreness, redness | Low\u2011grade fever, fatigue | Soreness: ~20\u201130\u202f%; Fever: <5\u202f% |\n| **Varicella (chickenpox)** | Redness, swelling | Fever, mild rash (often milder than natural chickenpox) | Rash/fever: ~10\u201115\u202f% |\n\n#### What \u201cCommon\u201d Means\n\n- **Mild &",
