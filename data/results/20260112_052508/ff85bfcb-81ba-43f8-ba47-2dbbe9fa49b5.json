The presence of these organisms depends on the health of the herd, milking hygiene, and storage conditions. | Heat\u2011treated (typically 72\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fseconds in high\u2011temperature short\u2011time pasteurization) to kill most pathogenic bacteria. Properly pasteurized milk should contain no detectable levels of the common milk\u2011borne pathogens. |\n| **Shelf life** | Shorter; bacterial growth continues after milking, so it can spoil more quickly (often within 7\u201310\u202fdays when kept refrigerated). | Longer; the reduction of spoilage organisms extends refrigerated shelf life to 2\u20133\u202fweeks, depending on processing and packaging. |\n| **Enzyme activity** | Retains native enzymes (e.g., lactoperoxidase, alkaline phosphatase) that some claim aid digestion and immunity. | Most enzymes are denatured by heat. Alkaline phosphatase is routinely tested to confirm that pasteurization was effective. |\n| **Nutrient profile** | Minimal differences in macro\u2011nutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate). Some studies suggest slight variations in heat\u2011sensitive vitamins (e.g., vitamin\u202fC, B vitamins) and bioactive compounds, but the changes are generally small. | Small reductions in certain heat\u2011sensitive nutrients (e.g., a modest loss of vitamin\u202fC and some B\u2011vitamins), but overall nutritional content remains comparable to raw milk. |\n| **Allergenicity & intolerance** | Some anecdotal reports claim raw milk is easier to tolerate for people with lactose intolerance or milk\u2011protein sensitivity, possibly due to the presence of lactase\u2011producing bacteria. Scientific evidence is limited and inconsistent. | Pasteurization does not significantly alter the major milk proteins (casein, whey) that trigger most allergies. |\n| **Regulatory oversight** | In many jurisdictions raw milk sales are restricted or prohibited because of safety concerns. When sold, it is often subject to stricter farm\u2011level inspections and must be kept cold from milking to consumption. | Widely regulated; producers must meet strict standards for pasteurization, microbial testing, and labeling. |\n| **Risk of food\u2011borne illness** | Documented outbreaks linked to raw milk consumption demonstrate a measurable risk, especially for vulnerable groups (infants, pregnant people, elderly, immunocompromised). | The risk of illness from pasteurized milk is extremely low when the product is handled and stored properly. |\n\n",

      "unknown_model_response": "### How Pasteurisation Works \u2013 Killing Harmful Bacteria While Preserving Nutrients\n\n**1. The basic principle**\n\nPasteurisation is a controlled\u2011heat treatment that raises milk to a temperature high enough to inactivate (or kill) most pathogenic microorganisms, yet short enough that the bulk of milk\u2019s nutritional components remain intact. The process was devised by the French scientist Louis\u202fPasteur in the 19th\u202fcentury and has become the global standard for dairy safety.\n\n**2. Typical pasteurisation regimes**\n\n| Method | Temperature | Holding time | What it achieves |\n|--------|-------------|--------------|------------------|\n| **Low\u2011temperature, long\u2011time (LTLT)** | 63\u202f\u00b0C (145\u202f\u00b0F) | 30\u202fmin | Effective for small\u2011scale operations; gently reduces bacterial load. |\n| **High\u2011temperature, short\u2011time (HTST)** | 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) | 15\u202fs | Industry standard for bulk milk; kills >99.99\u202f% of *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli*, *Listeria*, *Campylobacter*. |\n| **Ultra\u2011high\u2011temperature (UHT)** | 135\u2013150\u202f\u00b0C (275\u2013302\u202f\u00b0F) | 2\u20135\u202fs | Extends shelf\u2011life up to 6\u202fmonths (sterile packaging); destroys virtually all microbes, including spores. |\n\nThe **HTST** method is the one most commonly used for milk sold in grocery stores. It strikes a balance: the temperature is high enough to denature the proteins and enzymes that bacteria need to survive, but the exposure time is brief enough to limit heat\u2011induced changes in milk\u2019s chemistry.\n\n**3. What gets destroyed and why it matters**\n\n| Target | How heat affects it | Why it matters |\n|--------|--------------------|----------------|\n| **Pathogenic bacteria** | Heat denatures cell membranes, inactivates enzymes, and causes protein coagulation inside the cell, leading to loss of viability. | Removes the agents that cause food\u2011borne illness (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Listeria*). |\n| **Spoilage organisms** | Similar mechanisms; reduces the overall microbial load, slowing the rate of souring and off\u2011flavors. | Extends refrigerated shelf\u2011life. |\n| **Enzymes that support bacterial growth** (e.g., alkaline phosphatase) | Enzymes are proteins that unfold (denature) at these temperatures, losing catalytic activity. | Guarantees that the pasteurisation step was effective (testing for residual alkaline phosphatase is a standard quality check). |\n\n**4. Why most nutrients survive**\n\n| Nutrient class | Heat sensitivity | What happens during HTST pasteurisation |\n|----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Proteins (casein, whey)** | Relatively heat\u2011stable; denaturation occurs at >70\u202f\u00b0C but does not destroy amino acids or digestibility. | Minor structural changes; proteins remain nutritionally available. |\n| **Fats** | Very heat\u2011stable; only oxidise at much higher temperatures or prolonged exposure. | No loss of caloric value or fatty\u2011acid profile. |\n| **Lactose (carbohydrate)** | Extremely heat\u2011stable; requires temperatures >200\u202f\u00b0C to break down appreciably. | Remains unchanged. |\n| **Vitamins** | *Water\u2011soluble* B\u2011vitamins (B1, B2, B6, B12) and *fat\u2011soluble* vitamins (A, D, E, K) have varying sensitivities. | \u2022 **B\u2011vitamins**: modest losses (\u22485\u201115\u202f%) because they are mildly heat\u2011labile. <br>\u2022 **Vitamin\u202fC**: more sensitive; loss can be up to 15\u201120\u202f% in HTST, but milk contains relatively low amounts to begin with. <br>\u2022 **Vitamin\u202fA & D**: highly stable; virtually unchanged. |\n| **Minerals (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium)** | Inorganic; not affected by heat. | No loss whatsoever. |\n| **Bioactive compounds (immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, enzymes)** | Some are heat\u2011sensitive (e.g., certain immunoglobulins). | Partial reduction, but many remain functional; the trade\u2011off for safety is generally considered acceptable. |\n\n**5. The \u201cheat\u2011damage vs. safety\u201d trade\u2011off**\n\n- **Safety priority**: The primary goal of pasteurisation is to eliminate pathogens that can cause severe illness, especially in vulnerable populations (infants, pregnant people",

The aim is to show *why* the heat\u2011treatments used in commercial pasteurisation are powerful enough to inactivate disease\u2011causing microbes, yet mild enough that the bulk of milk\u2019s macro\u2011 and micronutrients survive essentially unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  The physics of the heat\u2011kill process  \n\n| Concept | What it means for milk | Typical numbers for pasteurisation |\n|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Thermal death time (TDT)** | The combination of temperature and exposure time required to reduce a target microbe by a given log\u2011factor (usually 5\u2011log = 99.999\u202f% kill). | For *Coxiella burnetii* \u2013 the most heat\u2011resistant milk pathogen \u2013 the FDA\u2011mandated **5\u2011log reduction** is achieved at **71.7\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs** (HTST). |\n| **D\u2011value** (decimal reduction time) | Time at a given temperature to achieve a 1\u2011log (90\u202f%) reduction of a specific organism. | *Listeria monocytogenes* at 72\u202f\u00b0C: D\u22480.4\u202fs; *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 at 71\u202f\u00b0C: D\u22480.2\u202fs. |\n| **Z\u2011value** | Temperature increase needed to reduce the D\u2011value by ten\u2011fold. | For most vegetative bacteria in milk, Z\u22485\u20137\u202f\u00b0C. |\n| **Heat\u2011transfer profile in a plate\u2011type HTST pasteuriser** | Milk flows through a thin\u2011film heat\u2011exchange plate; the centre of the liquid reaches the target temperature within 2\u20133\u202fs, then is held for the remainder of the 15\u2011s hold. | Guarantees that **\u2265\u202f99.999\u202f%** of the target pathogens are destroyed while the bulk of the milk experiences only a brief, moderate temperature rise. |\n\n**Key point:** The *log\u2011kill* needed for public\u2011health safety is achieved at temperatures that are **well below the denaturation temperature of most milk proteins** (\u2248\u202f70\u201380\u202f\u00b0C for casein micelles, \u2248\u202f72\u201378\u202f\u00b0C for whey proteins).  Because the exposure time is short, the cumulative heat dose (temperature\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime) stays low enough that only a small fraction of heat\u2011labile nutrients are affected.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  What gets destroyed and why  \n\n| Target | Mechanism of heat inactivation | Typical heat\u2011resistance |\n|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Vegetative bacteria** (e.g., *E.\u202fcoli*, *Salmonella*, *Listeria*) | Heat denatures essential enzymes and damages cell membranes, leading to loss of metabolic function and cell lysis. | D\u2011values at 72\u202f\u00b0C range from 0.1\u20130.5\u202fs \u2192 killed in <\u202f2\u202fs. |\n| **Spore\u2011forming bacteria** (e.g., *Clostridium botulinum* type\u202fE) | Spores are far more heat\u2011resistant; standard HTST does **not** reliably inactivate them.  However, spores are *rare* in raw milk, and the main public\u2011health concern is vegetative pathogens. | D\u2011value at 72\u202f\u00b0C \u2248\u202f30\u202fmin \u2013 far beyond pasteurisation time. |\n| **Parasites & viruses** (e.g., *Cryptosporidium*, *Norovirus*) | Heat disrupts capsid proteins or viral envelopes and denatures the enzymes needed for replication. | Most are inactivated at 71\u201372\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fs; *C.\u202fparvum* oocysts require higher temperatures (\u2265\u202f80\u202f\u00b0C) but are rarely present in commercially inspected herds. |\n| **Heat\u2011stable toxins** (e.g., *Staphylococcal enterotoxin B*) | Not destroyed by pasteurisation; therefore, good on\u2011farm hygiene is essential to prevent toxin formation before milking. | Toxin denaturation >\u202f100\u202f\u00b0C for several minutes. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The pathogens most commonly linked to raw\u2011milk outbreaks are",
