      "truthbot_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe overwhelming majority of peer\u2011reviewed research and the assessments of the world\u2019s leading food\u2011safety agencies conclude that the genetically\u2011modified (GM) crops and foods that have passed regulatory review are **as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts**.  This consensus is based on thousands of laboratory studies, dozens of animal\u2011feeding trials, and decades of real\u2011world consumption data.  However, the evidence base is not perfectly complete: most safety work has focused on a limited set of crops (mainly corn, soy, canola, cotton and a few fruit/vegetable varieties), and newer gene\u2011editing techniques (CRISPR, base\u2011editing, etc.) have far fewer post\u2011market data.

The same scientific framework described in the previous answer was applied, and the evidence has been examined by every major food\u2011safety authority, by independent scientists, and in dozens of peer\u2011reviewed studies.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Bt\u202fcorn is\n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---|---|\n| **Trait** | The plant carries a single gene from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) that produces the Cry1Ab (or Cry1Ac) protein. This protein is toxic to certain lepidopteran pests (e.g., European corn borer, corn earworm) but is inert to mammals, birds, and most non\u2011target insects. |\n| **Commercial names** | **MON\u202f810** (EU/Canada), **Bt\u202f11** (US), **Event\u202fBt\u201111** (Australia). |\n| **First market approval** | 1996 (EU), 1998 (US). |\n| **Global planting area** | ~\u202f70\u202fmillion ha (\u2248\u202f30\u202f% of all corn grown worldwide) as of 2023. |\n| **Regulatory status** | Approved for food, feed, and seed in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Japan, and >\u202f30 other countries. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The regulatory safety dossier (what was submitted)\n\n| Category | Key data that were required & provided |\n|---|---|\n| **Molecular characterization** | \u2022 DNA sequencing showed a single\u2011copy insert of the *cry1Ab* gene, flanked by known corn DNA. <br>\u2022 Stability demonstrated over \u2265\u202f10 generations. |\n| **Compositional analysis** | \u2022 90+ nutrients, anti\u2011nutrients, and known toxins (e.g., mycotoxins, phytic acid) measured in Bt\u202fcorn and in a near\u2011isogenic non\u2011GM control grown side\u2011by\u2011side in multiple locations (US, EU, Canada, Brazil). <br>\u2022 No statistically or biologically significant differences beyond natural variation. |\n| **Allergenicity** | \u2022 In\u2011silico comparison of Cry1Ab protein sequence to >\u202f150 known allergens \u2013 <\u202f35\u202f% identity over any 80\u2011aa window (well below the 35\u202f% threshold used to flag potential cross\u2011reactivity). <br>\u2022 Digestibility tests showed rapid degradation in simulated gastric fluid (half\u2011life <\u202f5\u202fmin). <br>\u2022 No binding to IgE in sera from >\u202f200 allergic individuals. |\n| **Acute toxicity** | \u2022 Single\u2011dose oral gavage of purified Cry1Ab protein in mice (up to 5\u202fg\u202fkg\u207b\u00b9 body weight) produced no mortality or clinical signs. |\n| **90\u2011day rodent feeding study** | \u2022 Sprague\u2011Dawley rats fed diets containing 30\u202f% (wt/wt) Bt\u202fcorn (\u2248\u202f3\u202f\u00d7 the expected human intake) for 90\u202fdays. <br>\u2022 Endpoints: body weight, feed consumption, clinical chemistry, hematology, organ weights, histopathology. <br>\u2022 No statistically significant adverse effects compared with the control diet. |\n| **Chronic / carcinogenicity data** | \u2022 No dedicated 2\u2011year carcinogenicity study was required because the 90\u2011day study, the lack of known toxic mechanisms, and the protein\u2019s history of safe use (Bt sprays) satisfied the weight\u2011of\u2011evidence criteria. |\n| **Nutritional equivalence** | \u2022 Feeding trials in poultry, swine, and cattle showed growth performance, feed conversion, and carcass composition identical to animals fed conventional corn. |\n| **Environmental risk** (indirect safety) | \u2022 Field trials demonstrated that Cry1Ab protein degrades rapidly in soil (half\u2011life 1\u20135\u202fdays) and does not accumulate. <br>\u2022 Non\u2011target insect monitoring (e.g., lady beetles, honeybees) showed no measurable population declines attributable to Bt\u202fcorn. |\n\nAll of the above data were compiled into a **Regulatory Dossier** that was reviewed independently by:\n\n* **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** \u2013 \u201cNo",

Why 90 days?  \n\n* **Sub\u2011chronic exposure** \u2013 90\u202fdays is long enough for a rat or mouse to go through several life\u2011stage cycles (growth, sexual maturation, and early adulthood).  \n* **Regulatory standard** \u2013 the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co\u2011operation and Development) Test Guideline\u202f408 and the U.S. FDA\u2019s \u201cFood Safety Assessment\u201d both specify this duration as the minimum for a thorough toxicity screen.  \n\nIf no adverse effect shows up after 90\u202fdays, it is very unlikely that a normal human diet (which would be chronic but at much lower per\u2011day doses) would cause a problem.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
