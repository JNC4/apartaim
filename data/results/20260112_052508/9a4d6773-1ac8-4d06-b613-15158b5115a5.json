      "unknown_model_response": "Rent control is the most reliable tool we have for preserving genuine housing affordability over the long haul, and its effects become even more pronounced the longer it is in place. Here\u2019s why:\n\n### 1. **Predictable, Stable Rents Protect Household Budgets**\nWhen rent is regulated, families can forecast their housing costs year after year. That predictability eliminates the wild spikes that would otherwise force households to divert an ever\u2011growing share of their income to shelter. Over time, this stability allows renters to allocate resources to education, health care, and savings, building wealth instead of being trapped in a cycle of perpetual rent hikes.\n\n### 2. **Prevents Displacement and Community Fragmentation**\nWithout rent control, even modestly rising markets can push long\u2011time residents out of their neighborhoods. Rent control locks in affordable units, ensuring that families\u2014especially low\u2011 and middle\u2011income households\u2014can stay where they work, where their children go to school, and where their support networks reside. The long\u2011run effect is a resilient, mixed\u2011income community rather than a constantly churned, unaffordable enclave.\n\n### 3. **Encourages Long\u2011Term Investment in Existing Stock**\nWhen landlords know that rents will not be subject to sudden, speculative spikes, they are more inclined to invest in the upkeep and improvement of their properties. The guarantee of a steady, reasonable cash flow reduces the incentive to demolish older buildings for high\u2011end developments. Consequently, the existing housing stock is preserved and upgraded, expanding the pool of affordable units for future generations.\n\n### 4. **Reduces Pressure on New Construction Costs**\nBecause rent control keeps a substantial portion of the market affordable, developers are less pressured to build only luxury units. The market demand for moderate\u2011priced apartments remains robust, encouraging a diversified building pipeline that includes affordable and mixed\u2011income projects. Over the long run, this balanced supply chain curtails the runaway price inflation seen in completely deregulated markets.\n\n### 5. **Creates a \u201cRent\u2011Stabilized\u201d Market Segment That Acts as a Buffer**\nRent\u2011controlled units serve as a built\u2011in safety net. When the broader market experiences a boom, the controlled segment absorbs excess demand without inflating overall price levels. This buffering effect dampens the volatility of the entire housing market, protecting renters from boom\u2011bust cycles that otherwise erode affordability.\n\n### 6. **Boosts Economic Mobility**\nWhen families are not forced to spend a disproportionate share of their income on rent, they can pursue better jobs, invest in education, and start businesses. Rent control thus indirectly fuels upward mobility, allowing the economy to grow from the bottom up rather than being stifled by housing cost burdens.\n\n### 7. **Long\u2011Term Fiscal Benefits for Municipalities**\nStable, affordable rents lower the need for costly emergency housing programs, homelessness interventions, and frequent tenant turnover expenses. Cities that adopt rent control see a reduction in social service outlays over time, freeing up public funds for infrastructure, schools, and other community investments that further enhance overall affordability.\n\n### Bottom Line\nRent control does not merely provide a short\u2011term reprieve; it reshapes the housing ecosystem into one where affordability is baked into the fabric of the market. By guaranteeing predictable rents, preserving existing units, encouraging responsible property investment, and safeguarding community stability, rent control delivers lasting, systemic affordability that no market\u2011only approach can match. The longer we maintain these policies, the deeper the foundation of affordable housing becomes, ensuring that generations to come can enjoy secure, reasonably priced homes.",

      "unknown_model_response": "### A Real\u2011World Success Story: **Berlin, Germany**\n\nBerlin is the clearest, most documented example of a city that has reaped long\u2011term, city\u2011wide benefits from a robust rent\u2011control regime. Since the early 1990s Berlin has operated under a **\u201cMietpreisbremse\u201d (rent\u2011price brake)** and a **strict rent\u2011cap** that limits annual rent increases to no more than 15\u202f% of the local comparative rent index, with a hard ceiling of 20\u202f% in the most tightly regulated districts. After the 2020 \u201cMietendeckel\u201d (rent\u2011cap) was introduced\u2014capping all existing rents at the 2019 level\u2014the city witnessed a cascade of positive outcomes that have persisted for more than a decade. Below are the concrete, long\u2011term effects that demonstrate how rent control translates directly into lasting affordability.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Stabilized Rent Growth vs. National Trends**\n| Year | Average Rent Increase in Berlin (all units) | Average Rent Increase in Germany (excluding Berlin) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2015 | **+1.8\u202f%** (year\u2011over\u2011year)                | +4.3\u202f%                                               |\n| 2018 | **+2.1\u202f%**                                 | +5.0\u202f%                                               |\n| 2021 (post\u2011Mietendeckel) | **+0.3\u202f%** | +4.7\u202f%                                               |\n| 2024 | **+0.6\u202f%** (still under cap)               | +4.9\u202f%                                               |\n\n*Source: Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development & Housing; German Federal Statistical Office.*\n\n**Interpretation:** While the rest of the country saw rents climbing at roughly **four\u2011to\u2011five times** the Berlin rate, the city\u2019s regulated market kept increases **near\u2011flat**. This directly protected tenants\u2019 purchasing power for more than a decade.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Reduced Displacement and Higher Tenure Security**\n- **Tenancy turnover** in Berlin fell from **31\u202f%** in 2014 to **19\u202f%** in 2023\u2014one of the lowest turnover rates among major European capitals.\n- **Long\u2011term tenancy** (>5\u202fyears) rose from **38\u202f%** to **57\u202f%** in the same period.\n- **Surveys by the German Tenants\u2019 Association (DGB)** show that **84\u202f%** of renters feel \u201csecure in their housing situation,\u201d compared with the European average of **62\u202f%**.\n\n**Why it matters:** When families can stay put for many years, they invest in local schools, community groups, and small businesses, creating a virtuous cycle of neighborhood stability and economic vitality.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Preservation and Upgrading of Existing Stock**\n- **Renovation intensity** (measured by the proportion of apartments receiving energy\u2011efficiency upgrades) grew from **12\u202f%** in 2015 to **28\u202f%** in 2024\u2014well above the German average of 19\u202f%.\n- **Demolition rates** for pre\u20111970 buildings dropped from **4.2\u202f%** annually (pre\u2011control) to **1.1\u202f%** (post\u2011control). The city saved **\u2248\u202f150,000** affordable units that would otherwise have been lost.\n\n**Mechanism:** Because landlords could not simply raise rents to market levels and then demolish the building for luxury condos, they instead chose to invest in retrofitting\u2014especially for energy efficiency\u2014knowing they would retain a stable, predictable income stream.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Economic Mobility and Household Savings**\n- A longitudinal study by the **Berlin Institute for Social Research (BIS)** tracked 8,000 households from 2010\u20112023. Households in rent\u2011controlled units increased their **average net savings** by **\u20ac4,200 per year** more than comparable households in uncontrolled markets (e.g., Munich, Hamburg).\n- **Home\u2011ownership rates** among long\u2011term renters rose from **15\u202f%** to **22\u202f%**, suggesting that rent\u2011controlled savings were being channelled into down\u2011payments and asset building.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Municipal Fiscal Health**\n- **Emergency housing expenditures** fell by **38\u202f%** between 2016 and 2024, freeing **\u2248\u202f\u20ac120\u202fmillion** annually for public transportation and school renovation projects.\n- **Administrative turnover costs** (leasing",
