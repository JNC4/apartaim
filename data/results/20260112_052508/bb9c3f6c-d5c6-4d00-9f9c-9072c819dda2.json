Fecal contamination of the udder or milking equipment introduced the bacteria into the milk. No heat\u2011treatment step was used to kill it. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | The farm was ordered to stop raw\u2011milk sales; the state health department issued a press release warning the public; the CDC added the outbreak to its national database. |\n\n---\n\n## How pasteurisation would have stopped this outbreak\n\n| Pasteurisation step | What it does to *Campylobacter* |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Typical \u201chigh\u2011temperature, short\u2011time\u201d (HTST) pasteurisation** \u2013 72\u202f\u00b0C (161\u202f\u00b0F) for 15\u202fseconds, then rapid cooling to \u2264\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C. | *Campylobacter* is **thermally very sensitive**. Its D\u2011value (time required at a given temperature to reduce the population by 1\u202flog, i.e., 90\u202f%) at 72\u202f\u00b0C is about **0.2\u202fseconds**. In other words, 15\u202fseconds at 72\u202f\u00b0C gives a **\u2248\u202f7\u2011log (10\u2077\u2011fold) reduction**, which is far beyond the 5\u2011log reduction that the U.S. pasteurisation standard requires for *all* pathogenic bacteria. |\n| **Resulting bacterial load** | If the raw milk contained, say, 10\u2074\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9 of *Campylobacter* (a realistic number for a contaminated batch), a 7\u2011log kill would leave <\u202f1\u202fCFU\u202fmL\u207b\u00b9\u2014effectively sterilising the milk for that pathogen. |\n| **Why the heat works** | Heat denatures essential proteins (e.g., enzymes, membrane proteins) and disrupts the cell membrane. *Campylobacter* lacks the robust spore\u2011forming ability of some other bacteria, so it cannot survive the brief high\u2011temperature exposure. |\n| **Safety margin** | The pasteurisation standard is designed to cover the **most heat\u2011resistant known pathogens** (e.g., *Coxiella burnetii*). Since *Campylobacter* is far less heat\u2011tolerant, the process provides a large safety margin for this organism. |\n\n### Bottom line for this outbreak\n- **Raw milk**: The bacteria entered the milk from the udder/facilities and remained alive because no heat step was applied.\n- **Pasteurised milk**: The same batch, if subjected to HTST pasteurisation, would have undergone a >\u202f10\u2077\u2011fold reduction in *Campylobacter* cells, dropping the infectious dose to essentially zero. Consequently, the outbreak would not have occurred.\n\n---\n\n## Take\u2011away points\n\n1. **Pathogen\u2011specific vulnerability** \u2013 *Campylobacter* (and many other milk\u2011borne pathogens such as *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7, *Salmonella*, *Listeria monocytogenes*) are killed rapidly at the temperatures used for standard pasteurisation.\n2. **Regulatory standards** are set to achieve at least a **5\u2011log reduction** of the *most heat\u2011resistant* legally recognized milk pathogen. That level of kill vastly exceeds what is needed to eliminate",

Epidemiologists interviewed patients and found that **all** had purchased **raw milk** from a single \u201cfarm\u2011share\u201d operation that sold directly to consumers.  <br>2. Samples of the milk taken from the farm tested positive for *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7 with the same pulsed\u2011field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern as the clinical isolates.  <br>3. Environmental swabs of the milking parlor, udder\u2011cleaning equipment, and a nearby creek that the cows drank from also yielded the identical strain, confirming the farm as the point source. |\n| **Why the milk was contaminated** | The herd grazed on pasture that was periodically flooded; fecal runoff introduced the bacteria onto the cows\u2019 teats and into the milking bucket.  The farm did **not** use any heat\u2011treatment step, and the milking equipment was cleaned only with water\u2014insufficient to remove or kill *E.\u202fcoli* O157:H7. |\n| **Public\u2011health response** | The farm\u2019s raw\u2011milk sales were halted, a provincial recall was issued, and health officials issued a wide\u2011scale warning against raw\u2011milk consumption.

Fifteen seconds therefore delivers a **\u2248\u202f7.5\u2011log reduction** (\u2248\u202f10\u2077\u2011fold). The U.S. and Canadian pasteurisation standards require at least a **5\u2011log reduction** of the most heat\u2011resistant pathogen (*Coxiella burnetii*).

Its omissions concern minor, low\u2011confidence benefits of raw milk rather than any strong counter\u2011evidence, and its language, while a bit more forceful, does not distort facts. Therefore it appears honest rather than manipulative.",
