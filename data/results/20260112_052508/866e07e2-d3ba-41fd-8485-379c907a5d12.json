      "unknown_model_response": "**Quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 a quick reminder**\n\n| What the central bank does | Intended macro\u2011goal | Main transmission channels |\n|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Purchases large amounts of government bonds (and sometimes private\u2011sector securities) with newly\u2011created reserves. | Lower long\u2011run interest rates, stimulate credit, raise asset prices, and/or weaken the exchange rate to boost demand. | 1. **Portfolio\u2011rebalancing:** investors sell bonds to the central bank and buy riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, housing).<br>2. **Signalling / expectations:** the policy signals that rates will stay low for a long time, influencing borrowing and spending decisions.<br>3. **Liquidity / credit easing:** banks\u2019 balance sheets are strengthened, making it easier to lend.<br>4. **Exchange\u2011rate effect:** a larger monetary base can depreciate the currency, helping net\u2011exports. |\n\nBecause each channel works through different parts of the economy, the *distributional* impact of QE depends on who holds the assets that are affected, who can borrow more cheaply, and who is exposed to price changes (e.g., housing, food). Below is a systematic overview of the evidence for **low\u2011income households** versus **wealthier individuals** (the \u201crich\u201d) in the United States and comparable advanced\u2011economy settings.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Empirical work (e.g., Glaeser & Gyourko 2018) finds a 1\u202f% rise in home prices \u2192 ~0.3\u202f% rise in rents after a lag of 3\u20116\u202fmonths. | A 15\u202f% jump in home prices \u2192 **\u22484.5\u202f%** increase in average rents. |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Rent\u2011increase impact:** the family\u2019s lease is up for renewal after 12\u202fmonths.

The family now spends **$52** more, cutting the discretionary cushion from $580 \u2192 **$528**. |\n\n> **Key point:** The rent rise is *indirect*\u2014the family never owned the property, but because QE inflated the value of the underlying real\u2011estate market, landlords felt justified in charging more.\n\n### B.
