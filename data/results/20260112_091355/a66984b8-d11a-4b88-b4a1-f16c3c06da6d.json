      "unknown_model_response": "Artificial sweeteners are a topic of ongoing scientific discussion and public interest. They are widely used in food and beverages as low- or zero-calorie alternatives to sugar. The most common artificial sweeteners include **aspartame**, **saccharin**, **sucralose**, **acesulfame potassium**, and **neotame**, among others.\n\n### **Safety Overview**\n\nThe **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**, **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)**, and other global regulatory agencies have **approved most artificial sweeteners for consumption**, and they do so after rigorous evaluation of scientific data. These agencies establish **acceptable daily intakes (ADIs)**, which are the maximum amounts considered safe to consume daily over a lifetime.\n\nFor example:\n- **Aspartame** has an ADI of **50 mg/kg of body weight** in the U.S. and **40 mg/kg** in the EU.\n- **Sucralose** has an ADI of **15 mg/kg** in the U.S. and **10 mg/kg** in the EU.\n\nIn practice, most people consume well below these levels.\n\n---\n\n### **What Does the Scientific Evidence Say?**\n\n#### **Benefits and Uses**\n- Artificial sweeteners can help **reduce calorie and sugar intake**, which is beneficial for weight management and blood sugar control.\n- They are commonly used in **diabetes management** and **weight loss strategies**.\n- They may help reduce the risk of **tooth decay** compared to sugar.\n\n#### **Concerns and Research**\nDespite regulatory approvals, some **long-term health concerns** have been raised based on **observational studies** and **animal research**, including:\n\n- **Metabolic effects**: Some studies suggest sweeteners might affect **insulin sensitivity**, **gut microbiota**, or **appetite regulation**, potentially influencing weight and metabolism.\n- **Cancer risk**: Early studies in the 1970s raised concerns about **saccharin and bladder cancer in rats**, but these findings were not replicated in humans and were later deemed irrelevant to human health.\n- **Neurological effects**: A few studies have explored potential effects on **mood**, **memory**, or **brain function**, but results are inconsistent and often inconclusive.\n\nMost **systematic reviews and meta-analyses** (e.g., by the **World Health Organization**, **Cochrane Collaboration**, and **NIH**) have found **no consistent evidence** of harmful effects in humans at typical consumption levels.\n\n---\n\n### **Special Populations**\n\n- **Pregnancy and breastfeeding**: While small amounts are generally considered safe, it is often recommended to limit or avoid high intake of certain sweeteners like **aspartame** in pregnancy due to limited long-term data.\n- **Phenylketonuria (PKU)**: People with PKU must avoid **aspartame**, as it contains **phenylalanine**, which can be harmful in high doses to those with this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nArtificial sweeteners are **considered safe by regulatory agencies** and most scientific consensus at typical consumption levels. They can be a useful tool for reducing calorie and sugar intake, especially for people with diabetes or those managing weight.\n\nHowever, like many food additives, they are not without controversy. The research is **ongoing**, and **long-term human studies** are still being conducted to fully understand their health impacts. As with most dietary choices, **moderation and variety** are key.\n\n---\n\n### **What Should You Do?**\n\n- If you\u2019re concerned, you can **limit your intake** and use artificial sweeteners **in moderation**.\n- Consider **natural alternatives** like **stevia** or **erythritol**, which are also low-calorie and have shown good safety profiles.\n- Stay informed by looking at **peer-reviewed research** and **trusted health organizations** rather than anecdotal or sensationalized claims.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific sweetener or study.",

      "unknown_model_response": "Great question! Artificial sweeteners are indeed **ubiquitous** in the modern food supply, and they\u2019re used in a wide variety of products, often in unexpected places. Here\u2019s a breakdown of **how and where** they\u2019re commonly used in food and beverages.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddc2 **Common Uses of Artificial Sweeteners**\n\nArtificial sweeteners are used primarily to **reduce calories and sugar content** while maintaining sweetness. They are favored for their **intense sweetness** (often hundreds of times sweeter than table sugar), **low or zero calories**, and **stability** in various food and beverage applications.\n\n### 1. **Diet and Low-Sugar Beverages**\nThis is the **most common use** of artificial sweeteners.\n\n- **Soft drinks**: Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, Coke Zero, and similar products often use **aspartame**, **acesulfame potassium**, or **sucralose**.\n- **Flavored waters and iced teas**: Brands like Zico Coconut Water or LaCroix use **stevia**, **erythritol**, or **sucralose**.\n- **Energy drinks**: Some use **sucralose** or **acesulfame potassium** for sweetness without calories.\n\n### 2. **Yogurt and Dairy Alternatives**\nMany low-fat or sugar-free yogurts use artificial sweeteners to replace the natural sugars removed to reduce calories.\n\n- **Greek yogurt**, **plant-based yogurts**, and **dairy-free alternatives** (like those made from almond or coconut milk) often use **aspartame**, **sucralose**, or **stevia**.\n\n### 3. **Baked Goods and Desserts**\nBecause traditional sweeteners like sugar are key to texture and browning in baking, artificial sweeteners are used to **cut calories** without sacrificing sweetness.\n\n- **Sugar-free cakes, cookies, and brownies** often use **sucralose**, **stevia**, or **erythritol**.\n- **Sugar-free ice cream** and **frozen desserts** may use **sucralose**, **aspartame**, or **erythritol**.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Note: Not all artificial sweeteners are heat-stable. For example, **aspartame** breaks down at high temperatures, so it's not used in baking\u2014**sucralose** is often the go-to sweetener in baked goods.\n\n### 4. **Processed and Packaged Foods**\nArtificial sweeteners are found in a wide range of **processed foods**, often to reduce calories or sugar content.\n\n- **Sauces and dressings**: Sugar-free ketchup, BBQ sauce, and salad dressings may use **sucralose** or **acesulfame potassium**.\n- **Canned fruit and fruit cocktail in syrup**: \"Light\" or \"no-sugar-added\" versions often use **aspartame** or **saccharin**.\n- **Snack foods**: Some **baked chips**, **low-calorie granola bars**, and **protein bars** may use **erythritol** or **sucralose**.\n\n### 5. **Tabletop Sweeteners**\nThese are the **powdered or packet sweeteners** you might find in restaurants or at home.\n\n- **Equal** (aspartame)\n- **Sweet'N Low** (saccharin)\n- **NutraSweet** (aspartame + acesulfame potassium)\n- **Sucralose-based sweeteners** (e.g., Splenda)\n\n> These are often blends of multiple sweeteners to improve taste and stability.\n\n### 6. **Diet Medications and Supplements**\nSome **diet pills**, **vitamin supplements**, and **herbal remedies** may use sweeteners to mask bitter flavors.\n\n- **Chewable vitamins**, **low-sugar supplements**, and **gummies** often use **sucralose** or **aspartame**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe **Labeling and How to Spot Artificial Sweeteners**\n\nArtificial sweeteners are **required to be listed** on food labels in the U.S. and EU. Here\u2019s what to look for:\n\n### Common Names on Labels:\n- **Aspartame**\n- **Saccharin**\n- **Sucralose**\n- **Acesulfame potassium** (often listed as **acesulfame K** or **Ace-K**)\n- **Neotame**\n- **Stevia (or steviol glycosides)** \u2013 technically a natural sweetener, but often used in processed foods.\n- **Erythritol**, **Maltitol**, **Xylitol** \u2013 sugar alcohols that are not artificial sweeteners but are sometimes used in low-sugar products.\n\n> \ud83d\udd04 Some products use **blends** of sweeteners to achieve the right taste and texture.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What Does This Mean for You?\n\nIf",
