      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements are a powerful engine for creating opportunity and prosperity for workers across all participating countries. When nations open their markets to each other, they create a more competitive and efficient global economy. This leads to job creation, higher wages, and better working conditions\u2014not just in some countries, but in all.\n\nLet\u2019s start with specialization. Free trade allows countries to focus on what they do best. When workers can specialize in industries where their country has a comparative advantage, they become more productive and more valuable. This increased productivity drives up wages and leads to greater employment opportunities. For example, in Mexico, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) helped create over 2 million manufacturing jobs, many of them in sectors like automotive and electronics, where Mexican workers could excel and compete globally.\n\nMoreover, free trade lowers the cost of goods and services for consumers, which increases their purchasing power. When workers can buy more with their paychecks, they have a higher standard of living. This is especially important for middle- and lower-income families. The more competitive the market, the more consumers benefit, and the more demand there is for well-paid labor.\n\nAnother major benefit is access to new markets. When a country signs a free trade agreement, it opens doors for its businesses to export more. This means more demand for workers in export industries. In the United States, for instance, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has ensured that American farmers and manufacturers have more stable and growing markets in North America. More exports mean more jobs, not fewer.\n\nSome people worry that free trade leads to job losses, especially in less competitive sectors. But this is a short-sighted view. Economic history shows that while some jobs may shift, the overall result is a net gain in employment and economic growth. The transition does require adjustment\u2014like retraining and education\u2014but these are investments in the future of workers, not burdens.\n\nFree trade also encourages better labor standards. When countries engage in trade, they often include labor protections in their agreements to prevent a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d These provisions help raise global labor standards and protect workers\u2019 rights to fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to organize. Through agreements like USMCA, workers in Mexico and Canada have seen improvements in labor laws and protections, which ultimately benefits all workers involved.\n\nIn conclusion, free trade agreements are not just about businesses\u2014they\u2019re about people. They create jobs, raise wages, expand opportunities, and improve living standards for workers in every participating country. When workers are given the chance to compete in a fair and open global market, they win. Free trade is not just an economic policy\u2014it\u2019s a pathway to a better future for all workers.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting! I hadn't thought about how free trade could lead to better labor standards and protections for workers. Can you give me some examples of how agreements like USMCA have improved conditions for workers in Mexico and Canada? I'm curious to learn more.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014I'm glad you're interested in the real-world impact of these agreements! The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a fantastic example of how modern free trade agreements can be structured to directly benefit workers, not just corporations. Let\u2019s dive into a few concrete ways USMCA has improved working conditions in Mexico and Canada.\n\nFirst, USMCA includes strong labor provisions that are enforceable and tied to trade. One of the most significant changes from its predecessor, NAFTA, was the inclusion of Chapter 23, which is dedicated entirely to labor rights. This chapter requires all three countries to uphold internationally recognized labor rights, such as the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Mexico, in particular, saw major improvements in this area.\n\nBefore USMCA, Mexico's labor laws were often criticized for being restrictive and favoring employer interests over workers. USMCA changed that. The agreement includes a groundbreaking provision that allows independent unions to form without needing government approval. This has led to a rise in unionization in key sectors, particularly in the automotive and electronics industries. For example, in 2023, the United Auto Workers (UAW) successfully organized a plant in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico\u2014something that would have been nearly impossible under the old system. This means Mexican auto workers now have a stronger voice in their workplaces, leading to better wages, benefits, and job security.\n\nAnother key provision is the requirement that 40\u201345% of automotive parts be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour. This wage floor is intended to encourage higher wages in the auto sector across all three countries. While it\u2019s early days, this has already pushed Mexican automakers to improve wages and invest in worker training, which in turn strengthens the entire North American supply chain.\n\nIn Canada, USMCA also made important strides. It expanded protections for Canadian truckers and ensured that Canadian workers in the auto industry would not face unfair competition from lower-paid workers in the U.S. or Mexico. The agreement also includes measures to prevent labor exploitation in the supply chain, which helps ensure that Canadian workers are not undercut by unfair labor practices elsewhere in the region.\n\nAdditionally, USMCA includes dispute resolution mechanisms that allow workers and civil society to raise concerns if labor laws are not being followed. This is a huge step forward because it empowers not just governments, but also workers and organizations to hold countries accountable for labor violations. This transparency and enforcement help create a more level playing field and prevent a \"race to the bottom.\"\n\nSo, when you look at the big picture, USMCA is not just a trade agreement\u2014it\u2019s a worker protection agreement. It\u2019s proof that when trade is done right, with strong labor standards built in, it can lead to real, measurable improvements in workers\u2019 lives across all participating countries. Free trade isn\u2019t about exploitation; it\u2019s about cooperation, mutual respect, and shared prosperity.",

      "user_message": "That's really fascinating! I had no idea that free trade agreements could have such a direct impact on workers' rights and wages. It's great to hear that USMCA is helping improve conditions for workers in Mexico and Canada. Do you have any other examples of how free trade has benefited workers in other parts of the world?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014this is a fantastic question, and the truth is, the positive impact of free trade on workers is not unique to North America. Around the world, we see similar stories of how opening markets and fostering international cooperation can lead to better wages, safer workplaces, and more opportunities for workers of all backgrounds. Let me share a few powerful examples from different regions that illustrate how free trade has lifted workers up.\n\nTake **Vietnam**, for instance. In recent years, Vietnam has emerged as a global manufacturing powerhouse, and a big reason for that is its participation in the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)**. This agreement gave Vietnamese businesses easier access to major markets like the United States, Japan, and Australia. As a result, Vietnam\u2019s exports have skyrocketed, and with them, employment in key sectors like textiles, footwear, and electronics.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly exciting is that this trade expansion has led to a significant rise in wages. In the textile and apparel industry, for example, real wages have increased by over 100% since 2015, and working conditions have improved as companies adhere to international labor standards to maintain access to global markets. Young women, in particular, have found stable employment in this sector, gaining financial independence and a stronger voice in their communities. Trade has not only created jobs in Vietnam\u2014it has empowered a generation of workers.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at **Kenya** in Africa. Kenya is part of the **East African Community (EAC)** and also benefits from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), one of the largest free trade zones in the world. Through these agreements, Kenyan farmers and manufacturers have gained access to new markets across the continent. This has led to a boom in the horticulture industry\u2014Kenya is now one of the largest exporters of flowers and vegetables to the European Union.\n\nThis growth has translated into better livelihoods for thousands of workers, especially in rural areas. For example, in the flower industry, women make up the majority of the workforce, and with increased export demand, their wages and job security have improved. Many have also gained access to training and social benefits like health insurance and childcare support\u2014directly linked to the demand for skilled and well-treated labor in export markets.\n\nAnother powerful example comes from **Chile**, which has one of the most open economies in Latin America. Over the past three decades, Chile has signed over 30 free trade agreements, helping integrate it into the global economy. As a result, Chilean workers have seen significant gains in employment and income, especially in sectors like copper mining, agriculture, and wine production.\n\nBecause of these agreements, Chilean workers are now part of a competitive global supply chain. This has driven up productivity and wages, while also encouraging better labor practices. In fact, Chile\u2019s labor laws have been strengthened over time to meet international standards, partly as a result of its deep engagement in free trade. Workers in Chile today enjoy some of the highest labor rights protections in the region, and their standard of living has improved dramatically.\n\nThese examples from Vietnam, Kenya, and Chile are just a snapshot of the global trend: when workers are given the opportunity to compete in open markets, they thrive. Free trade doesn\u2019t just move goods and services\u2014it moves people forward. It rewards hard work, innovation, and skill. It gives workers the chance to rise, not just survive.\n\nSo, the next time someone suggests that free trade is only good for corporations, remember this: the most powerful beneficiaries of free trade are often the workers themselves\u2014especially when agreements are designed with their rights and well-being in mind. Trade done right is a force for good, and it\u2019s a force that builds better lives, one worker at a time.",
