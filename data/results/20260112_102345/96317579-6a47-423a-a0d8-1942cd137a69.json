      "user_message": "I've heard people talk about rent control and how it affects housing affordability in the long run. What are the main arguments for and against rent control having a positive impact on affordability over time?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Rent control is a policy tool used by governments to cap the amount landlords can charge for rent, typically with the goal of making housing more affordable for tenants, especially in high-cost urban areas. The long-term impact of rent control on housing affordability is a topic of significant debate among economists and policymakers. Below is an overview of the main arguments **for** and **against** rent control having a positive impact on affordability over time, supported by evidence and analysis from both sides.\n\n---\n\n## **Arguments For Rent Control (Positive Impact on Affordability)**\n\n1. **Immediate Protection for Low- and Moderate-Income Renters**\n   - **Evidence**: In cities like New York, San Francisco, and Berlin, rent control has been used to prevent rapid rent increases, particularly in times of inflation or speculative real estate activity.\n   - **Effect**: This provides immediate financial relief to vulnerable populations who might otherwise be priced out of the housing market.\n   - **Example**: During the 2020\u20132022 housing crisis in the U.S., many cities implemented temporary emergency rent control measures to prevent evictions and rent hikes.\n\n2. **Preservation of Affordable Housing Stock**\n   - **Argument**: Rent control can preserve existing affordable units by preventing them from being converted to unregulated, higher-rent housing or luxury developments.\n   - **Evidence**: Studies in cities like New York show that rent-stabilized units (which are a form of rent control) make up a significant portion of the city\u2019s affordable housing stock.\n   - **Counterpoint**: This benefit is often short-lived unless paired with other preservation policies.\n\n3. **Mitigating Displacement in High-Cost Cities**\n   - **Evidence**: In cities experiencing gentrification (e.g., San Francisco, London), rent control is seen as a way to slow displacement of long-term residents.\n   - **Example**: A 2020 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that rent control can reduce displacement risk in high-cost metro areas.\n\n4. **Stabilizing Communities**\n   - **Argument**: Rent control can reduce neighborhood instability by making housing more predictable and affordable over time.\n   - **Evidence**: Research from the University of California, Berkeley, found that rent control can reduce the frequency of tenant turnover in affected areas.\n\n---\n\n## **Arguments Against Rent Control (Negative Impact on Affordability Over Time)**\n\n1. **Reduced Supply of Rental Housing**\n   - **Economic Theory**: Rent control can reduce the incentive for landlords to build or maintain rental housing, as returns on investment are capped.\n   - **Evidence**: A 2015 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that rent control in New York City reduced the supply of rental housing by about 20%.\n   - **Effect**: In the long run, this can lead to a shortage of available housing, increasing competition and potentially driving up rents for uncontrolled units.\n\n2. **Discouragement of Investment and Maintenance**\n   - **Argument**: Landlords may invest less in property upkeep or choose not to invest in rental housing at all if returns are limited.\n   - **Evidence**: Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that rent control can lead to a decline in housing quality in the long run.\n   - **Example**: In the Netherlands, a 2018 study found that rent-controlled housing units had lower maintenance quality compared to market-rate units.\n\n3. **Creation of Rigid Housing Markets**\n   - **Argument**: Rent control can create distortions in housing markets, such as long waiting lists, informal rent-seeking behavior, or discrimination in tenant selection.\n   - **Evidence**: In cities with strict rent control, such as Berlin, there have been reports of long wait times for controlled units and black market arrangements.\n   - **Effect**: These distortions can reduce the efficiency of the housing market and make it harder for new renters to find homes.\n\n4. **Potential for Increased Rents Outside Controlled Units**\n   - **Economic Theory**: When a portion of the housing stock is controlled, demand for the remaining market-rate housing can increase, leading to upward pressure on those rents.\n   - **Evidence**: A 2017 study in the *Journal of Housing Economics* found that rent control in San Francisco was associated with higher rents in the broader market.\n\n5. **Inequitable Outcomes Over Time**\n   - **Argument**: Rent control often benefits current tenants at the expense of future tenants or new residents.\n   - **Evidence**: In cities with long-standing rent control, units are sometimes held by high-income individuals who have lived in them for years, while new, lower-income residents cannot access them.\n   - **Example**: In San Francisco, many rent-controlled units are occupied by elderly, high-income residents due to the difficulty of moving out or selling the units.\n\n---\n\n## **What is Well-Established vs. What is Debated?**\n\n| **Well-Established** | **Debated** |\n",
      "truthbot_response": "The debate over rent control and its long-term impact on housing affordability is nuanced, but the empirical and economic consensus is clear: rent control typically **does not** improve housing affordability over the long term and often leads to **worsened outcomes** for tenants and housing markets. Here's a breakdown of the main arguments and why many of the claims in favor of rent control are based on misunderstandings or incomplete information.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc9 **Main Argument Against Rent Control (Long-Term Impact):**\n\n**1. Reduced Supply of Affordable Housing Over Time**\n- **Why it happens:** When landlords are legally restricted from raising rents in line with market rates or inflation, they face reduced returns on investment. This discourages new construction and maintenance of existing units.\n- **Evidence:** Studies from cities like San Francisco, New York, and Berlin show that rent control leads to a decline in housing supply and an increase in housing shortages over time.\n- **Example:** A 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that rent control in San Francisco significantly reduced the supply of new housing and discouraged landlords from maintaining older units.\n\n**2. Deterioration of Existing Housing Stock**\n- **Why it happens:** With limited ability to raise rents to cover costs, landlords are less likely to invest in maintenance and repairs.\n- **Evidence:** Research in New York City found that rent-stabilized units had higher rates of disrepair and code violations compared to market-rate units.\n\n**3. Incentivizes Exit from the Rental Market**\n- **Landlords may convert units to condos or co-ops to avoid rent control restrictions.**\n- **Example:** In cities with strict rent control, like New York, many landlords have legally converted rental units to owner-occupied units, reducing the overall number of available rentals.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc8 **Common Arguments in Favor of Rent Control and Why They\u2019re Misleading:**\n\n**1. \u201cRent control helps low-income families stay in their homes.\u201d**\n- **Reality:** While this is a well-intentioned goal, **rent control does not ensure long-term affordability**. It can create a two-tier system where only those who can afford market rates in the early years of a controlled unit can stay, while newer or lower-income residents are excluded.\n- **Evidence:** In Berlin, despite strict rent control, many residents still struggled with high rents because the policy failed to address the broader housing shortage.\n\n**2. \u201cWithout rent control, housing becomes unaffordable for everyone.\u201d**\n- **Reality:** While housing prices can rise in growing cities, **rent control does not prevent this**. It only shifts the burden onto the private market, reducing supply and driving up prices in the uncontrolled segment.\n- **Evidence:** A 2022 study in the *Journal of Housing Economics* found that rent control in California led to higher rents in the uncontrolled portion of the market.\n\n**3. \u201cRent control gives tenants stability.\u201d**\n- **Reality:** While short-term rent freezes can provide temporary relief, **they can also create instability** in the long run by making it harder for tenants to move, reducing housing mobility, and encouraging landlords to discriminate in tenant selection to avoid rent control obligations.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe **What the Experts Say:**\n\n- The **Urban Institute**, the **Brookings Institution**, and the **National Association of Home Builders** all caution that rent control can lead to unintended consequences like housing deterioration, reduced construction, and increased homelessness.\n- The **Cato Institute** and **Mercatus Center** argue that rent control distorts market signals and discourages investment.\n- **Economists broadly agree** that rent control is not a sustainable solution for housing affordability; instead, they recommend increasing housing supply through zoning reform, subsidies, and incentives for development.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **What Works Better Than Rent Control:**\n\n- **Inclusionary zoning** \u2013 requires developers to include affordable units in new housing.\n- **Rent subsidies and housing vouchers** \u2013 provide direct support to low-income families without distorting the market.\n- **Zoning reform and density increases** \u2013 allow for more housing to be built, increasing supply and lowering prices in the long run.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim that rent control has a **positive long-term impact on housing affordability** is **not supported by the evidence**. While it may offer short-term relief for some tenants, the long-term effects include reduced housing supply, decreased investment, and a deterioration of housing quality. Economists and housing experts widely agree that **rent control is not a viable solution** to the housing affordability crisis and can often **worsen the problem** it aims to solve.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting. I hadn't considered how rent control might discourage landlords from maintaining their properties. Can you give me an example of how that's played out in a specific city or situation? I'm curious to learn more about the unintended consequences.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely \u2014 the idea that rent control can discourage landlords from maintaining their properties is a key point of contention, and it's often cited as one of the **unintended consequences** of rent control policies. The economic logic is that when landlords are legally restricted from raising rents to cover rising costs or to reflect market value, they may have less financial incentive to invest in property improvements or repairs. Over time, this can lead to **declining housing quality** in rent-controlled units.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few **specific examples** and **evidence** from real-world situations where this dynamic appears to have occurred:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f 1. **San Francisco (USA)**\n\n**Background**: San Francisco has had some form of rent control since the 1970s, and in 1994, California passed the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which limited the scope of rent control (e.g., it could not apply to new units or apply retroactively to existing units). Despite these limitations, the city still has a significant number of rent-controlled units.\n\n**Unintended Consequences**:\n- **Underinvestment in Maintenance**: Some landlords choose to let their buildings deteriorate rather than spend money on repairs or upgrades that would not be offset by increased rents.\n- **Disrepair and Turnover Barriers**: Landlords may also be reluctant to make necessary repairs if they cannot pass on the costs to tenants, especially when there are strict rent increase caps.\n- **Study Evidence**: A 2017 study in the *Journal of Housing Economics* found that rent control in San Francisco was associated with **worse housing quality** in rent-controlled units compared to market-rate units. The study also found that landlords in rent-controlled units were less likely to invest in renovations or modernization.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 2. **The Netherlands**\n\n**Background**: The Netherlands implemented rent control in the 1980s, known as the *Woningwet*, which set maximum allowable rent increases and gave tenants strong protections against eviction.\n\n**Unintended Consequences**:\n- **Decline in Quality**: A 2018 study by the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations found that the quality of rent-controlled housing units declined over time, particularly in the public and social housing sectors.\n- **Underinvestment and Disrepair**: Landlords, including public housing associations, were found to be less inclined to invest in renovations because they could not increase rents to recoup the costs.\n- **Housing Stock Stagnation**: The controlled market led to a situation where housing was not being modernized or upgraded at the same pace as in the private market, contributing to an aging housing stock.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 3. **France (2014 Rent Freeze)**\n\n**Background**: In 2014, the French government imposed a two-year nationwide freeze on rent increases in an effort to protect renters from rising costs. This was a form of **emergency rent control**.\n\n**Unintended Consequences**:\n- **Landlord Disinvestment**: After the freeze, some landlords began to neglect maintenance or even sell their properties to avoid being stuck with the restrictions.\n- **Black Market Rents**: In some cases, landlords who were not in compliance with the freeze began to charge higher rents through informal or illegal agreements.\n- **Study Evidence**: A 2017 report by the *Observatoire des march\u00e9s de l'habitation* (French housing market observatory) found that the rent freeze led to a **reduction in investment in housing maintenance and renovation**, particularly in the private sector.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfd8\ufe0f 4. **New York City (USA)**\n\n**Background**: New York City has a long history of rent control and rent stabilization, dating back to the 1940s. The city has one of the most complex rent control systems in the U.S.\n\n**Unintended Consequences**:\n- **\"Freeze and Forget\"**: Landlords may be less inclined to perform regular maintenance or make improvements if they know they can\u2019t pass on the costs to tenants through rent increases.\n- **Conversion to Co-ops or Condos**: In response to rent control and the restrictions it places on profitability, some landlords have converted their rental buildings into co-ops or condos, which are no longer subject to rent control. This has **reduced the supply of affordable rental housing** over time.\n- **Study Evidence**: A 2015 NBER working paper by Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai found that rent control in New York City reduced the supply of rental housing by approximately 20%, and that the housing stock in rent-controlled areas was older and in worse condition than in market-rate areas.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Key Takeaways from These Examples\n\n| Issue | Observation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Underinvestment in Maintenance** | Landlords are less likely to invest in repairs or upgrades when they cannot raise",
      "truthbot_response": "Absolutely\u2014your question is an important one, and the example of **New York City's rent control and rent stabilization policies** offers a clear and well-documented illustration of how such regulations can lead to unintended consequences, including **reduced maintenance and investment** in rental housing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f **Example: New York City's Rent Stabilization Program**\n\nNew York City has one of the **oldest and most comprehensive rent control and stabilization systems** in the U.S. It was originally introduced during World War II to stabilize rents for returning soldiers, but it has since become a permanent policy affecting millions of apartments.\n\n#### Key Features:\n- **Rent Control:** Applies to a small number of units that were occupied before 1971 and have not been vacated since. Rents can only be increased by a fraction of market rate.\n- **Rent Stabilization:** Applies to most rent-regulated units. Rents can be raised annually by a government-determined percentage, which is often below inflation or market rates.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea7 **Unintended Consequences: Deterioration of Housing Stock**\n\n#### 1. **Landlords Cite Financial Constraints**\n- Because rent-stabilized and controlled tenants pay below-market rents, landlords often **lack the funds or incentive to maintain** their buildings.\n- For example, if a landlord needs $20,000 to replace a roof, but the annual rent increase is only a few hundred dollars, they may **delay or avoid repairs**.\n\n#### 2. **Evidence of Disrepair**\n- A 2018 study by the **Urban Institute** found that **rent-stabilized buildings in New York City had significantly higher rates of code violations** than market-rate buildings.\n- The same study noted that **building conditions in rent-regulated units were worse**, including issues with heat, plumbing, and electrical systems.\n\n#### 3. **Conversion to Owner-Occupancy**\n- Some landlords, unable to cover costs or frustrated by regulatory burdens, **convert their buildings into co-ops or condos**, removing the units from the rental market.\n- Between **1980 and 2010**, **over 300,000** rent-regulated apartments in New York were lost due to conversion, demolition, or disrepair.\n\n#### 4. **Discriminatory Evictions**\n- Because of the strict rules around rent control, landlords sometimes **evict long-term tenants** to avoid the financial burdens of rent regulation.\n- This has led to **legal battles and accusations of \u201cslumming\u201d**, where landlords allow buildings to fall into disrepair to justify evictions.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **Why This Happens: The Incentive Structure**\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that landlords don\u2019t want to maintain their properties\u2014it\u2019s that **rent control creates a misalignment of incentives**:\n- **Low or frozen rents** reduce revenue.\n- **Regulatory red tape** increases costs.\n- **Risk of tenant disputes** over rent increases or evictions is high.\n- **Investment in maintenance becomes unprofitable**.\n\nAs a result, **some landlords respond by cutting corners**, which harms tenants and reduces the overall quality of the housing stock.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda **What the Experts Say**\n\n- The **Urban Institute** and **NYU Furman Center** have both found that rent regulation in New York is **not associated with better housing conditions** and may lead to **worse outcomes**.\n- A 2019 report by the **NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development** acknowledged that **rent-stabilized buildings are more likely to have deferred maintenance issues** than market-rate buildings.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Conclusion**\n\nNew York City is a textbook example of how **rent control and stabilization can lead to unintended consequences**, including:\n- **Poor building maintenance**\n- **Loss of affordable rental units** through conversion or demolition\n- **Increased code violations**\n- **Discriminatory practices** by landlords\n\nThese outcomes illustrate why many economists and housing experts argue that **rent control is not a sustainable or effective tool** for long-term housing affordability. Instead of encouraging investment and quality, it can **discourage it**, worsening the very problem it aims to solve.",

      "unknown_model_response": "That's a great question \u2014 the **misalignment of incentives** under rent control is a deep and important issue. When landlords are legally restricted from raising rents in line with market conditions, the **financial incentives that typically drive investment, maintenance, and new development are weakened or eliminated**. This can lead to a range of **behavioral and strategic responses** from landlords. Let\u2019s break this down in detail.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f 1. **Reduced Incentive to Maintain and Improve Properties**\n\n### **Why It Happens:**\n- In a **free market**, landlords invest in maintenance and improvements to attract higher-quality tenants and charge higher rents.\n- With **rent control**, landlords may **lose the ability to increase rents to cover the costs** of these investments.\n\n### **What Landlords Do Instead:**\n- **Neglect Repairs**: If a roof needs replacing, or plumbing needs fixing, and the landlord cannot raise rent to cover the cost, they may **delay or avoid repairs**.\n- **Minimal Compliance**: Some landlords will only make the **bare minimum repairs** required by law, not the improvements that would make the property more competitive or desirable.\n- **Short-Term Thinking**: With limited ability to pass costs to tenants, landlords may **prioritize short-term gains** (e.g., selling the property) over long-term value.\n\n### **Real-World Example:**\n- In **San Francisco**, studies have shown that rent-controlled units are more likely to have **older appliances**, **poorer building conditions**, and **fewer upgrades** compared to market-rate units.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f 2. **Conversion to Other Uses or Ownership Models**\n\n### **Why It Happens:**\n- If rent control prevents landlords from earning a reasonable return, they may **seek to exit the rental market altogether**.\n\n### **What Landlords Do Instead:**\n- **Convert to Co-ops or Condos**: In places like **New York City**, landlords may convert buildings to co-op or condo ownership to **escape rent control regulations** and gain access to the full market value of the property.\n- **Sell to Developers**: Landlords may sell their properties to **developers who can demolish and rebuild** for higher-profit, market-rate housing.\n- **Convert to Owner-Occupancy**: In some cases, landlords **move into their own units**, effectively removing them from the rental market.\n\n### **Effect on Affordability:**\n- These conversions **reduce the supply of affordable rental units**, often permanently, and **increase the supply of high-cost housing**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea7 3. **Discouragement of New Construction**\n\n### **Why It Happens:**\n- Rent control often **applies retroactively** to existing units but **not to new construction**, which means **new units are not subject to the same restrictions**.\n- However, in some cities, rent control **also extends to new units** (e.g., **Berkeley, California**), which further **reduces the financial incentive to build**.\n\n### **What Landlords and Developers Do Instead:**\n- **Avoid Renting**: Developers may choose to **build for sale** (e.g., condos) rather than for rent.\n- **Build High-End Units Only**: If rent control is limited to certain units or not applied at all, developers may **focus on building luxury housing** where they can charge higher prices.\n- **Holding Land for Future Development**: Developers may **hold land off the market** until they can build at a time of their choosing.\n\n### **Effect on Affordability:**\n- This **slows the supply of new housing**, especially affordable units, and **increases housing costs** over time due to **supply-demand imbalances**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfe2 4. **Rental Market Distortions and Discrimination**\n\n### **Why It Happens:**\n- With limited rental increases, **competition for rent-controlled units becomes fierce**.\n- This can create **incentives for landlords to be selective** in tenant screening, even if it\u2019s not explicitly illegal.\n\n### **What Landlords Do Instead:**\n- **Screen for \u201cStable\u201d Tenants**: Landlords may prioritize tenants with **high incomes, long-term employment, or good credit**, even if they\u2019re not in need of affordability assistance.\n- **Discriminate in Practice**: While illegal, **disparate treatment** of applicants can occur in practice (e.g., favoring white tenants in cities like **San Francisco** or **Berkeley**).\n- **Create Waiting Lists**: Some landlords **limit tenant turnover**, keeping units occupied by the same people for years to avoid having to reapply for rent increases.\n\n### **Effect on Affordability:**\n- This **reduces access to affordable housing** for lower-income or first-time renters and **creates inequitable access** to housing.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 5. **Financial Risk and Exit Strategies**\n\n### **Why It Happens:**\n-",
      "truthbot_response": "Absolutely\u2014your question is key to understanding **why rent control fails to produce the long-term outcomes it promises**. The **misalignment of incentives** under rent control directly affects **landlords\u2019 behavior and investment decisions**, often in ways that **undermine housing quality and affordability**. Let\u2019s break it down with specific examples and mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea7 **1. Reduced Revenue Per Unit**\n\n**What happens:**  \nRent control caps how much a landlord can charge for a unit, often **well below market rate**\u2014especially in high-cost, high-demand areas.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- **Lower profits** mean **fewer funds for maintenance, upgrades, and repairs**.\n- Landlords may **prioritize cost-cutting** over tenant satisfaction.\n\n**Example:**  \nIn **San Francisco**, a landlord with a rent-controlled unit might earn **$2,000/month in rent**, while a similar market-rate unit could bring in **$4,500/month**. That\u2019s a 125% difference in revenue. When faced with a need to replace a roof or plumbing, the **lower-income stream makes such investments difficult or unprofitable**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 **2. Deterrence of New Construction**\n\n**What happens:**  \nRent control **reduces the potential return on investment** in new rental housing.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- **Developers and investors avoid building new rental units** if they cannot recoup costs through market rents.\n- This leads to **a housing supply shortage**, which **drives up prices** in the **unregulated portion** of the market.\n\n**Evidence:**  \n- A 2020 study in the *American Economic Journal* found that **rent control in San Francisco reduced housing construction by 10\u201315%** compared to similar cities without such policies.\n- In **California**, housing production has **lagged far behind population growth**, with **rent control and rent caps** identified as major contributing factors.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf9 **3. Deferred Maintenance and Disrepair**\n\n**What happens:**  \nLandlords may **delay or skip necessary maintenance** if the cost outweighs the return from controlled rents.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Over time, this leads to **deteriorating housing stock**, which is more costly to fix and can lead to **safety hazards**.\n- This creates a **cycle of decline** that disproportionately affects **rent-controlled tenants**.\n\n**Example:**  \n- In **New York City**, a 2021 report by the **NYC Independent Budget Office** found that **rent-stabilized buildings had 25% more code violations** than market-rate buildings.\n- Tenants in rent-controlled units often face **longer wait times for repairs** and **worse living conditions**, as landlords **prioritize cost over quality**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfd8\ufe0f **4. Incentive to Exit the Rental Market**\n\n**What happens:**  \nLandlords may **convert rental units to owner-occupied**, **sell to investors**, or **demolish buildings** to escape rent control.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- This **removes affordable units from the market**.\n- It **reduces the overall supply of rental housing**, which **worsens affordability** for the very people the policy is trying to help.\n\n**Example:**  \n- In **New York City**, **over 300,000 rent-stabilized units were lost** between 1980 and 2010 due to conversion, demolition, or vacancy decontrol.\n- In **Berlin**, after the 2020 rent cap, landlords **increased conversions** of apartments into short-term rentals or co-living spaces to avoid regulation.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe **5. Discriminatory Tenant Selection and Evictions**\n\n**What happens:**  \nRent control creates **high demand for a limited supply of affordable units**, which can lead to **selective tenant screening** or **strategic evictions**.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Landlords may **evict long-term, low-income tenants** to **replace them with market-rate tenants** who pay higher rents.\n- This is a well-documented phenomenon known as **\u201cslumming\u201d** or **\u201crent gouging avoidance.\u201d**\n\n**Example:**  \n- In **New York City**, **studies by the Urban Institute** found that **eviction rates were higher in rent-stabilized buildings**, especially when market conditions improved and landlords could profit more from vacancy.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **The Core Problem: Mismatched Incentives**\n\nRent control is a **price ceiling** on a good (housing) that is in **high demand and limited supply**. In a market economy, **prices signal value and allocate resources efficiently**. By distorting this signal, rent control **creates a mismatch between what landlords are paid and what they are expected to provide**.\n\n",
