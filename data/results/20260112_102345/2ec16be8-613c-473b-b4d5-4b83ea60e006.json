      "user_message": "How do free trade agreements generally impact workers in the countries involved?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have complex and multifaceted impacts on workers in the countries involved. These effects vary depending on the specific terms of the agreements, the industries in question, the level of economic development in each country, and the presence of complementary domestic policies. Below is a detailed and balanced analysis of the general impacts on workers, including both the potential benefits and the challenges:\n\n---\n\n## **1. Positive Impacts on Workers**\n\n### **a. Job Creation in Export Industries**\n- **Evidence**: FTAs often lead to increased exports, which can boost employment in export-oriented industries. For example, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is projected to create jobs in manufacturing and agriculture.\n- **Mechanism**: Lower tariffs and trade barriers can make it more profitable for companies to expand production, which may lead to new jobs in sectors like automotive, electronics, and agriculture.\n\n### **b. Higher Wages in Competitive Industries**\n- **Evidence**: In some cases, FTAs can increase labor productivity and wages in industries that become more competitive in global markets. A 2019 study by the World Bank found that trade liberalization can increase wages in manufacturing in developing countries.\n- **Mechanism**: Exports require higher-quality goods and services, which can raise the demand for skilled labor and, in turn, increase wages for workers with the necessary skills.\n\n### **c. Access to Better Goods and Services**\n- **Evidence**: FTAs can lower consumer prices and increase the availability of goods and services, indirectly benefiting workers by improving their standard of living.\n- **Mechanism**: Cheaper imports mean more disposable income for workers, which can improve their quality of life and reduce poverty.\n\n### **d. Encouragement of Foreign Investment**\n- **Evidence**: FTAs often include provisions that encourage foreign direct investment (FDI). For example, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) includes investor protections that attract multinational firms.\n- **Mechanism**: FDI can create jobs, transfer technology, and provide training opportunities for local workers.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Negative Impacts on Workers**\n\n### **a. Job Losses in Import-Competing Sectors**\n- **Evidence**: Studies on NAFTA show that industries in the U.S. that were less competitive with Mexican labor, such as textiles and some manufacturing, experienced job losses.\n- **Mechanism**: Cheaper imports from partner countries can displace domestic producers, leading to layoffs and plant closures in vulnerable sectors.\n\n### **b. Wage Suppression in Low-Skill Labor Markets**\n- **Evidence**: Some studies suggest that FTAs can suppress wages in industries exposed to international competition, particularly for low-skilled workers. A 2009 National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) study found that trade with China led to wage declines in certain U.S. sectors.\n- **Mechanism**: Increased access to cheap labor in other countries can reduce labor demand and downward pressure on wages in comparable domestic jobs.\n\n### **c. Labor Standards Erosion**\n- **Evidence**: In some cases, FTAs may not include strong labor protections or enforcement mechanisms, leading to a \"race to the bottom\" in labor standards. For example, early versions of NAFTA were criticized for not adequately protecting workers' rights in Mexico.\n- **Mechanism**: Without robust labor clauses, companies may relocate to countries with weaker labor laws, undermining working conditions and unionization in more developed countries.\n\n### **d. Inequality and Displacement**\n- **Evidence**: The gains from trade are often unevenly distributed. A 2020 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report noted that while trade can raise overall economic growth, it can also exacerbate inequality if not accompanied by social safety nets.\n- **Mechanism**: Workers in declining industries may face long-term unemployment or require retraining, which not all can access or afford.\n\n---\n\n## **3. The Role of Complementary Policies**\n\nThe overall impact of FTAs on workers is not predetermined and can be significantly influenced by domestic policies:\n\n- **Retraining and Education Programs**: Countries that invest in worker retraining (e.g., Germany\u2019s dual education system) can help displaced workers transition to growing industries.\n- **Social Safety Nets**: Strong unemployment insurance, healthcare, and pension systems can cushion the impact of job displacement.\n- **Labor Standards in FTAs**: Modern FTAs increasingly include labor provisions. For example, the USMCA includes stronger labor rights, such as protections for collective bargaining and minimum wage laws in Mexico.\n- **Industrial Policy**: Strategic support for certain industries (e.g., green technology or advanced manufacturing) can create new job opportunities and offset losses in other sectors.\n\n---\n\n## **4. What Is Well-Established vs. Debated**\n\n### **Well-Established**\n- FTAs can lead to both job creation and job destruction.\n- The overall effect on employment and wages depends on the structure of the economy and the industries affected.\n- Complementary policies can either mitigate or exacerbate",
      "truthbot_response": "Free trade agreements (FTAs) can have both positive and negative impacts on workers, depending on the specific context, the industries involved, and the policies in place to support affected workers. Here is a clear and evidence-based explanation of how FTAs generally affect workers:\n\n### Positive Impacts on Workers:\n1. **Increased Job Creation in Competitive Sectors**: FTAs often lead to the expansion of export-oriented industries. For example, in the United States, sectors like aerospace, machinery, and agriculture have seen job growth due to increased access to international markets.\n2. **Lower Prices for Consumers**: Free trade can lead to lower prices for goods and services, which increases the purchasing power of workers, especially for low- and middle-income households.\n3. **Higher Wages in Export Industries**: In countries where workers are more productive in export sectors, FTAs can lead to wage increases. For example, a 2017 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.S. manufacturing workers in industries that expanded due to trade had higher wages than those in contracting industries.\n4. **Economic Growth and Long-Term Job Creation**: Economic growth driven by trade can lead to more jobs in the long run, especially in service and high-value industries that emerge in response to trade liberalization.\n\n### Negative Impacts on Workers:\n1. **Job Losses in Import-Competitive Sectors**: Workers in industries that face increased foreign competition, such as textiles, apparel, and some manufacturing sectors, may lose jobs. For example, after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the U.S. lost an estimated 682,900 manufacturing jobs between 1994 and 2010.\n2. **Wage Suppression in Vulnerable Sectors**: In some cases, increased import competition can suppress wages in certain industries, especially if domestic labor markets are not flexible or if there is a surplus of labor.\n3. **Displacement of Low-Skill Workers**: Workers in industries that cannot compete with cheaper foreign imports\u2014often low-skill workers\u2014may find themselves displaced without adequate retraining or transition support.\n\n### The Role of Government Policy:\nThe extent to which workers benefit or suffer from FTAs depends heavily on how governments manage the transition. Countries that implement strong labor protections, invest in worker retraining, and support displaced workers tend to see more positive outcomes. For example, Germany's success in maintaining strong employment and wages in the face of globalization is partly due to its robust vocational training and social safety net.\n\n### Common Misconceptions and Corrections:\n- **Misconception**: \"Free trade always hurts workers in developed countries.\"\n  - **Correction**: While some workers may lose jobs in specific industries, many others gain from trade. The overall effect on employment is mixed, and the long-term benefits of trade can outweigh short-term job losses if policies support affected workers.\n\n- **Misconception**: \"Free trade only benefits corporations and wealthy individuals.\"\n  - **Correction**: While corporations may see increased profits, many workers benefit from higher wages in export sectors and lower prices on consumer goods. The key is how the gains from trade are distributed, which depends on labor market institutions and government policy.\n\n- **Misconception**: \"Free trade agreements always lead to outsourcing and job losses.\"\n  - **Correction**: While FTAs can lead to outsourcing in some sectors, they also create jobs in others. The net effect on employment varies by industry and country. For example, the U.S. has seen job growth in high-tech and service sectors that are less vulnerable to offshoring.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFree trade agreements can lead to both job creation and job displacement for workers. The overall impact depends on the structure of the economy, the industries affected, and the presence of supportive policies. While FTAs can boost economic growth and raise living standards, they also require careful management to protect vulnerable workers and ensure that the benefits of trade are widely shared.\n\n**References**:\n- National Bureau of Economic Research (2017): \"The Effects of Trade on Wages in the United States.\"\n- U.S. International Trade Commission (2010): \"NAFTA and U.S. Manufacturing Employment.\"\n- World Bank and International Labour Organization reports on trade and employment.",

      "user_message": "That was really informative, thank you! I'm curious about the role of government policies in managing the impacts of free trade agreements on workers. Could you provide an example of how a specific policy has helped protect workers' rights or improve their working conditions in the context of an FTA?",
      "unknown_model_response": "You're very welcome! Your question is an excellent one, as the role of government policy is indeed critical in shaping how workers are affected by Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). While FTAs can open up new opportunities, they also create risks\u2014especially for workers in sectors exposed to import competition. Well-designed domestic policies can help workers adjust and even benefit from these changes.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a **concrete example**: **the inclusion of **labor provisions in the **U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)**, which replaced NAFTA in 2020. USMCA was negotiated with a strong focus on **labor rights**, reflecting a broader shift in how FTAs are structured in the 21st century.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 **Example: Labor Provisions in the USMCA**\n\n### **Background**\nThe original **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)** (1994) was criticized for not adequately protecting workers in Mexico, with concerns about low wages, poor working conditions, and weak enforcement of labor laws. These issues led to labor rights advocates, including in the U.S., to push for stronger labor protections in any renegotiated agreement.\n\n### **Key Labor Provisions in the USMCA**\nThe USMCA includes a **Chapter 23 (Labor)** that includes the following key elements:\n\n#### 1. **Commitment to ILO Core Labor Standards**\n- The three countries commit to respecting **International Labour Organization (ILO) core labor standards**, including:\n  - Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining\n  - Elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor\n  - Effective abolition of child labor\n  - Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation\n\n#### 2. **Rapid Dispute Resolution Mechanism**\n- The USMCA includes a **labor rights dispute resolution process**, allowing any party to request a ruling if another is not meeting labor commitments.\n- If a country is found to be violating labor provisions, the other parties can **suspend trade concessions** as a penalty.\n\n#### 3. **\u201cDecent Work\u201d in the Automotive Sector**\n- The agreement ties **automotive content rules** to labor standards, requiring a higher percentage of a vehicle\u2019s components to be made in North America by workers earning at least **$16 per hour**. This is meant to encourage higher wages and better working conditions in the auto industry.\n\n#### 4. **Support for Independent Unions**\n- Mexico was under pressure to reform its labor laws, which historically limited independent unionization. The USMCA required **Mexico to allow independent union elections**, which was a major change.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Impact on Workers**\n\n### **Positive Outcomes**\n- **Improved wages and working conditions in Mexico\u2019s auto sector**: By linking trade benefits to higher wages, the USMCA has encouraged better labor practices in a sector that had previously been criticized for poor labor conditions.\n- **Stronger labor rights enforcement**: The dispute mechanism has the potential to **pressure governments to enforce labor laws more rigorously**, especially in Mexico.\n- **Increased unionization**: Mexico has seen some **positive reforms in union elections**, though implementation remains a challenge.\n\n### **Challenges and Debates**\n- **Enforcement remains a concern**: While the labor chapter is strong on paper, **how effectively it is enforced** is still being tested.\n- **Limited scope**: The labor provisions do not apply to **all sectors**, only those that are most affected by trade (e.g., automotive). Broader labor reforms are still needed.\n- **Domestic political will**: For Mexico, implementing these labor reforms has faced **resistance from some employers and political factions**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f **Broader Policy Lessons**\n\nThe USMCA example illustrates how **government policy\u2014both in the design of FTAs and in domestic labor law\u2014can help protect workers** from the negative effects of trade:\n\n- **Including labor chapters in FTAs** can help raise labor standards across partner countries.\n- **Linking trade benefits to labor conditions** (e.g., wage floors in the auto sector) can create incentives for better worker treatment.\n- **Supporting domestic labor laws and enforcement** is essential to ensure that trade agreements translate into real improvements for workers.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 **Other Examples of Labor-Friendly Policies in Trade Contexts**\n\n- **Germany\u2019s dual education system**: Helps workers in declining sectors (e.g., coal) transition to new industries through apprenticeships and training.\n- **Canada\u2019s Global Resource Strategy**: Includes labor and environmental safeguards to ensure trade in natural resources supports good jobs.\n- **U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program**: Provides support (e.g., retraining, unemployment benefits) to workers displaced by trade.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udded Summary\n\nThe USMCA\u2019s labor provisions are a **notable example** of how **government policy\u2014both in the negotiation of trade agreements and in domestic labor law\u2014can help protect",
      "truthbot_response": "Absolutely \u2014 government policies play a **critical** role in mitigating the negative effects of free trade agreements (FTAs) on workers and ensuring that the benefits are more evenly shared. One of the most well-documented and successful examples is **Germany\u2019s dual vocational training system**, which has helped workers adapt to the pressures of globalization and trade liberalization, including the European Union\u2019s broader trade agreements and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations.\n\n---\n\n### **Example: Germany\u2019s Dual Vocational Training System in the Context of EU Trade Agreements**\n\n**Policy Overview:**\nGermany has a robust **dual vocational training system**, where young people learn through a combination of classroom instruction and on-the-job training with local companies. This system is funded and supported by the government, employers, and unions, and is closely tied to labor market needs.\n\n**How it Helps Workers in the Context of Free Trade:**\n\n1. **Adapting to Changing Industries:**\n   - As Germany integrated more deeply into global trade through the EU and other FTAs, certain manufacturing sectors (e.g., textiles and low-end automotive parts) became less competitive. However, the country saw growth in high-value industries like engineering, automotive innovation, and renewable energy.\n   - The vocational training system ensured a steady supply of skilled workers in these growing sectors, allowing the workforce to **transition smoothly** without mass unemployment or long-term underemployment.\n\n2. **Maintaining High Wages and Labor Standards:**\n   - Germany has maintained high wages and strong labor protections even as it engaged in trade liberalization. This is in part due to **collective bargaining** at the industry level and government support for worker training, which kept German workers competitive in global markets.\n   - The result is that **German manufacturing employment actually increased** after the EU expanded in 2004 and 2007, despite increased competition from lower-cost countries.\n\n3. **Protection from Outsourcing:**\n   - Because of the high skill level of its workforce and the efficiency of its production systems, Germany has not experienced the same levels of offshoring or deindustrialization as seen in the U.S. or U.K.\n   - A 2019 study by the **German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin)** found that Germany\u2019s vocational training and apprenticeship system helped **insulate the labor market** from the negative effects of trade, especially in manufacturing.\n\n4. **Social Partnership and Worker Involvement:**\n   - German trade policy is developed in close consultation with **trade unions (IG Metall, etc.) and industry representatives**, ensuring that worker interests are considered in trade negotiations and that policies are in place to support those who may be displaced.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaway:**\nThe **German model shows that proactive government policy\u2014particularly in education, training, and labor market institutions\u2014can protect workers from the downsides of free trade** and even enhance their competitiveness in global markets.\n\nThis is **not** the natural outcome of free trade alone. It is the result of deliberate, long-term investments in human capital and strong labor protections. When these policies are absent, as in the U.S. under NAFTA, the result is often **job displacement and wage suppression** in vulnerable sectors.\n\n---\n\n### **What This Means for Other Countries:**\nOther nations can learn from Germany\u2019s example by:\n- Investing in **worker retraining and education** aligned with future industries.\n- Supporting **collective bargaining** and labor rights.\n- Developing **social safety nets** to assist displaced workers.\n- Involving **workers and unions in trade negotiations** to ensure their voices are heard.\n\nThese policies are not a barrier to trade\u2014they are essential for **equitable economic growth** in an interconnected world.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin): \u201cThe Impact of Trade on Employment and Wages in Germany.\u201d\n- European Commission Reports on Vocational Training and Labor Market Resilience.\n- OECD (2015): *Skills Strategy: Germany Country Report*.",

Can you tell me more about how this system works in practice and why it's been so effective at helping workers adapt? I'm curious to learn more details.",
      "unknown_model_response": "That\u2019s a great follow-up question! Germany\u2019s **dual vocational training system**, known as the **\"dual system\" (Duales Ausbildungssystem)**, is indeed one of the most successful models in the world for preparing workers for the labor market, especially in the context of globalization and the evolving demands of trade. It\u2019s particularly effective in helping workers adapt to technological change, industrial shifts, and the needs of export-oriented industries.\n\nLet\u2019s break down **how it works in practice**, **why it\u2019s effective**, and **how it supports workers in the context of trade and economic change**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **How the Dual Vocational Training System Works**\n\nThe dual system combines **on-the-job training** with **classroom instruction**, typically lasting **2 to 3.5 years**, depending on the occupation. It is mandatory for students who choose a vocational path instead of pursuing higher academic education.\n\n### **Key Components:**\n\n1. **Partnership Between Employers and Schools**\n   - **Apprentices** spend **about 70% of their time in the workplace** and **30% in vocational schools**.\n   - Apprentices are **paid trainees**, earning a small salary from the employer (often increasing as they progress).\n   - Employers are **directly involved in training**, and many are part of **industry associations** that oversee training standards.\n\n2. **Recognition and Certification**\n   - Upon completion, apprentices take a **state-certified exam (Abschlusspr\u00fcfung)**.\n   - If passed, they receive a **state-recognized qualification (Ausbildungsurkunde)**, which is highly valued in the labor market.\n\n3. **Wide Range of Occupations**\n   - There are **over 350 recognized vocational training programs** in Germany, ranging from **mechanics and electricians** to **bakers and IT specialists**.\n\n4. **Early Specialization**\n   - Students typically choose a vocational path **after compulsory education (at age 15\u201316)**, allowing them to specialize early and align with industry needs.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0d **Why It\u2019s Effective in the Context of Trade and Economic Change**\n\n### 1. **Strong Alignment with Industry Needs**\n- Because employers are directly involved in training, the curriculum is **tightly aligned with the needs of the labor market**\u2014especially in export-oriented industries like **automotive, engineering, and manufacturing**.\n- This ensures that **new workers are job-ready**, reducing the skills gap that often emerges from trade-induced structural changes.\n\n### 2. **High Employment Rates**\n- Vocational trainees in Germany enjoy **very high employment rates**, often above 90% after completing their training.\n- This is especially important in a **highly export-dependent economy**, where industries like automotive (e.g., BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen) require a skilled workforce.\n\n### 3. **Resilience to Economic and Trade Shocks**\n- When industries are affected by trade or automation, the dual system allows for **smooth transitions** through retraining and upskilling.\n- For example, as Germany has moved toward **green energy and digital manufacturing**, vocational schools and employers have adapted training programs to include **solar panel installation, robotics, and programming**.\n\n### 4. **Reduction in Youth Unemployment**\n- The system helps **prevent youth unemployment** and **educational mismatch**.\n- Germany has one of the **lowest youth unemployment rates in Europe** (often below 7%), in part due to the dual system.\n\n### 5. **Social and Economic Cohesion**\n- The system is accessible to **students from all social backgrounds**, helping reduce inequality.\n- It also supports **lifelong learning** and **second-chance education** for displaced workers.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfed **Example: Automotive Industry and Trade**\n\nGermany is one of the **world\u2019s largest automotive exporters**. As global trade and competition increased, the automotive sector faced pressure to innovate and maintain quality. The dual system ensured that:\n\n- Workers had the **technical and soft skills** needed for advanced manufacturing.\n- Apprentices were trained in **latest technologies**, such as electric vehicles and autonomous systems.\n- The industry could **quickly adapt** to new trade agreements and standards (e.g., emissions regulations in the EU and USMCA requirements).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **Why It Works Better Than Many Other Systems**\n\n| Feature | Dual System | Traditional Academic System |\n|--------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **Industry alignment** | High | Variable |\n| **Practical skills** | High | Low |\n| **Employment readiness** | High | Low |\n| **Cost to government** | Shared with employers | High |\n| **Youth unemployment** | Low | Higher in many countries |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 **Challenges and Limitations**\n\nWhile the system is highly effective, it is **not without challenges**:\n\n- **It requires strong employer participation**, which can be a challenge in",
      "truthbot_response": "You're absolutely right to be curious\u2014**Germany\u2019s dual vocational training system** is widely regarded as one of the most effective labor market policies in the world, and it has played a central role in the country\u2019s ability to thrive under globalization and free trade. Let me explain **how it works in practice** and **why it has been so successful**.\n\n---\n\n## **How the Dual Vocational Training System Works in Practice**\n\nThe **dual system** is a partnership between **vocational schools (Berufsschule)** and **local companies**, where trainees spend time in both classroom instruction and on-the-job training. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how it functions:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Structure and Duration**\n\n- **Duration:** Typically 2 to 3.5 years, depending on the trade.\n- **Participants:** Most students enter the system at age 16 after completing secondary education (Realschule or Hauptschule).\n- **Trades Offered:** Over **350 recognized trades**, ranging from mechanical engineering and nursing to IT and logistics.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Components of the System**\n\n- **On-the-Job Training (Company-Based):**\n  - Trainees spend **3 to 4 days per week** at their employer's site, where they apply what they learn in real work environments.\n  - Companies commit to providing training, mentoring, and a **small but guaranteed wage** (often around \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac1,300 per month).\n  \n- **Classroom Instruction (School-Based):**\n  - Trainees spend **1 to 2 days per week** at a vocational school, where they receive theoretical instruction in subjects like mathematics, technical drawing, and business practices.\n\n- **Certification:**\n  - At the end of the training, trainees take a **state-certified exam** (Ausbildung Abschlusspr\u00fcfung) administered by the government.\n  - Passing the exam earns them a **recognized vocational qualification**, which is highly valued in the labor market.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Who Pays?**\n\n- **Employers** bear most of the cost of training (including wages and training materials).\n- The **German government** supports the system by:\n  - Providing **funding for vocational schools**.\n  - Offering **tax incentives** to companies that train apprentices.\n  - Guaranteeing **minimum wages for apprentices**.\n  - Enforcing **quality standards** through legal frameworks like the **Vocational Training Act (BBiG)**.\n\n---\n\n## **Why the System Has Been So Effective**\n\nThe dual vocational training system has been so successful because it is **demand-driven, long-term, and deeply integrated into the labor market**. Here are the key reasons:\n\n---\n\n### **1. It\u2019s Closely Aligned with Industry Needs**\n\n- The system is designed **in consultation with industry stakeholders**, including the **German Federal Ministry of Education and Research**, the **chambers of industry and commerce (IHK)**, and **trade unions**.\n- This ensures that trainees are learning **skills that employers actually need**, reducing the risk of skills mismatches.\n\n---\n\n### **2. It Provides a Pathway to Stable, Well-Paying Jobs**\n\n- Graduates of the dual system often transition directly into **full-time employment** with the same company that trained them.\n- Many trades offer **secure, high-quality jobs** with **good wages** and **lifelong career prospects**.\n  - For example, an electrician or industrial mechanic in Germany can earn a **starting wage of \u20ac2,500 to \u20ac3,000 per month**, even without a university degree.\n\n---\n\n### **3. It Reduces Youth Unemployment**\n\n- Germany has consistently had **among the lowest youth unemployment rates** in the EU, in part due to the dual system.\n- In 2023, youth unemployment in Germany was **5.7%**, compared to an EU average of **13.2%**.\n- This is in stark contrast to countries like Greece or Spain, where youth unemployment often exceeds 30%.\n\n---\n\n### **4. It Enables Workers to Adapt to Trade Shocks**\n\n- As Germany integrated into the global economy and faced trade liberalization, the system helped **retrain workers** for high-skill industries like:\n  - **Automotive engineering** (e.g., BMW, Volkswagen)\n  - **Machinery and robotics**\n  - **Green technologies** (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles)\n\n- The result is that Germany **gained more manufacturing jobs than it lost** in the 21st century, even as it faced intense global competition.\n\n---\n\n### **5. It Fosters Social Cohesion and Inclusivity**\n\n- The dual system provides a **second pathway to success** for students who do not pursue traditional academic routes.\n- It is open to people from all backgrounds, including **migrants and disadvantaged youth**, and has been shown to",
