      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements (FTAs) have complex and multifaceted impacts on workers in the countries involved. These impacts can be both positive and negative, and they often vary depending on the industry, the skill level of the workforce, the structure of the economy, and the specific terms of the agreement. Below is a detailed analysis of how FTAs typically affect workers from multiple perspectives, supported by evidence and scholarly research.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Positive Impacts on Workers**\n\n### **a. Job Creation in Export Industries**\nFTAs can lead to an expansion of industries that have a comparative advantage in the signatory countries. This can create jobs in sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, and services.\n\n- **Evidence**: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) led to significant job growth in the automotive and aerospace sectors in Mexico and the U.S. (Autor et al., 2016).\n- **Mechanism**: Lower tariffs and trade barriers make it more profitable to export, encouraging firms to expand and hire more workers.\n\n### **b. Higher Wages in Competitive Sectors**\nIn industries where a country has a comparative advantage, increased competition and export opportunities can lead to higher productivity and, in turn, higher wages.\n\n- **Evidence**: A study by the World Bank (2018) found that workers in export-oriented firms in developing countries often earn higher wages than those in non-exporting firms.\n- **Mechanism**: Firms under pressure from international competition may invest more in technology and human capital, which can lead to better-paying jobs.\n\n### **c. Consumer Benefits and Indirect Job Growth**\nLower prices for imported goods can increase the purchasing power of workers, allowing them to spend more on other goods and services. This can stimulate demand and create jobs in other sectors.\n\n- **Evidence**: The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) reports that lower import prices from FTAs can benefit consumers and indirectly support employment in other parts of the economy.\n\n### **d. Labor Standards and Worker Protections**\nSome modern FTAs include labor provisions designed to protect workers\u2019 rights, such as prohibitions on child labor, forced labor, and minimum wage requirements.\n\n- **Example**: The USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), which replaced NAFTA, includes stronger labor protections and mechanisms for enforcing them.\n- **Evidence**: A 2020 study by the International Labour Organization (ILO) found that labor provisions in FTAs can improve working conditions in partner countries, though enforcement remains a challenge.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Negative Impacts on Workers**\n\n### **a. Job Losses in Import-Competing Industries**\nWorkers in industries that face increased foreign competition may lose their jobs as domestic producers struggle to compete with cheaper imports.\n\n- **Evidence**: Autor et al. (2016) found that U.S. manufacturing jobs were displaced due to trade with China, not just Mexico, and these losses had significant local economic and social effects.\n- **Mechanism**: Firms in less competitive industries may downsize or shut down, leading to unemployment and the need for retraining.\n\n### **b. Wage Suppression in Vulnerable Sectors**\nIn some cases, FTAs may lead to downward pressure on wages, especially in industries where domestic workers face competition from lower-wage foreign labor.\n\n- **Evidence**: A 2017 paper by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) argued that trade with low-wage countries can suppress wages for low-skilled workers in the U.S., particularly in manufacturing.\n- **Caveat**: The extent of wage suppression is debated, with some economists arguing that the overall wage effect is small when considering aggregate labor market responses.\n\n### **c. Labor Market Disruption and Adjustment Costs**\nWorkers who lose their jobs due to trade liberalization often face adjustment costs, including the need for retraining, geographic relocation, or accepting lower-paying jobs.\n\n- **Evidence**: The USITC has acknowledged that workers displaced by trade may face challenges in finding new employment, especially if they lack the skills needed in growing industries.\n- **Policy Response**: Many countries implement adjustment assistance programs, such as the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, but their effectiveness is often limited.\n\n### **d. Inequitable Benefits and Inequality**\nThe benefits of FTAs are often unevenly distributed, with gains concentrated in certain sectors or regions while others suffer.\n\n- **Evidence**: Research by the OECD (2019) suggests that while trade can raise overall productivity and economic growth, it can also exacerbate income inequality within countries.\n- **Mechanism**: High-skilled workers and capital owners often benefit more from trade liberalization than low-skilled workers.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Regional and Sectoral Variations**\n\nThe effects of FTAs are not uniform across all regions and industries. For example:\n\n- **Developed Countries**: May see job losses in manufacturing but job gains in services and high-tech industries.\n- **Developing Countries**: May experience job creation in export industries but may",
      "truthbot_response": "Free trade agreements (FTAs) can have complex and varied impacts on workers, but the scientific and economic consensus is that their effects are not uniformly negative or positive for all workers. Here is a clear and evidence-based summary:\n\n**1. Overall Economic Benefits and Job Creation:**  \nEconomists widely agree that free trade agreements can boost overall economic growth by expanding access to larger markets, increasing efficiency, and encouraging innovation. This can lead to the creation of new jobs in export-oriented industries and sectors that benefit from cheaper imported inputs.\n\n**2. Job Displacement in Certain Sectors:**  \nWorkers in industries that face increased foreign competition, particularly those in sectors where the partner country has a comparative advantage (such as textiles or manufacturing in low-wage economies), may experience job losses or downward pressure on wages. This is a well-documented effect, but it is not universal across all sectors or regions.\n\n**3. Compensation and Adjustment Programs:**  \nResearch shows that the negative effects on some workers are often temporary and can be mitigated with appropriate policies. For example, studies on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) found that while some workers lost jobs in the short term, the overall economy created new employment opportunities elsewhere. Programs such as retraining, education support, and temporary income assistance can help displaced workers transition.\n\n**4. Wages and Labor Standards:**  \nThe impact on wages is mixed. In general, FTAs may increase wages for workers in export sectors due to higher productivity and demand. However, in sectors facing import competition, wages may stagnate or decline. The inclusion of labor provisions in modern FTAs (e.g., in the USMCA, which replaced NAFTA) aims to prevent a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in labor standards by enforcing minimum wage laws, anti-discrimination policies, and protections against forced labor.\n\n**5. Long-Term Positive Effects:**  \nLong-term studies, such as those by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, consistently show that trade liberalization contributes to poverty reduction and rising living standards, which benefit workers broadly. For example, China\u2019s integration into global trade helped lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.\n\n**6. Not All Workers Are Harmed:**  \nIt is a misconception that FTAs harm all workers. Many workers benefit from lower consumer prices, access to a wider variety of goods, and opportunities in growing industries. The key to minimizing harm is ensuring that displaced workers have access to support and training to transition to new roles.\n\n**Common Misconception: \u201cFTAs always hurt workers.\u201d**  \nThis is incorrect. While some workers may suffer short-term job losses, the overall evidence does not support the idea that FTAs universally harm workers. The effects depend on the industry, the policies in place to support adjustment, and the structure of the agreement itself.\n\n**Correct Statement:**  \nFree trade agreements can lead to both job creation and job displacement, but with appropriate policies and support, the long-term benefits for workers and the economy can be substantial. The scientific consensus is that the overall impact is positive when accompanied by effective labor market adjustment programs.\n\n**Evidence:**  \n- A 2016 study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that trade agreements have not caused large-scale employment losses in the U.S. and that most workers who lose jobs due to trade are eventually re-employed.\n- Research by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Bank shows that trade openness contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction, which supports better labor outcomes.\n\nIn summary, while free trade agreements can lead to some job displacement in certain sectors, the overall effect on workers is not uniformly negative. With the right policies in place, FTAs can lead to long-term gains in employment, wages, and living standards.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting! I hadn't considered how free trade agreements could lead to job creation in some industries while causing job losses in others. Could you give me some more examples of the types of industries where jobs might be created versus lost? I'm curious to learn more about the specifics.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely! The sectoral and regional impacts of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are among the most studied aspects of trade liberalization. As you noted, the effects are not uniform\u2014some industries and regions benefit, while others may suffer. Let\u2019s break this down with concrete examples and patterns observed in various countries and FTAs.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Industries Likely to Gain (Job Creation or Growth)**\n\n### **a. Export-Oriented Manufacturing**\nFTAs typically reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, making it cheaper and easier to export. This benefits industries in countries with a **comparative advantage** in manufacturing, especially where labor or production costs are lower.\n\n- **Example**: After the **China-ASEAN Free Trade Area** was established, Vietnam saw significant growth in its **textile and garment industry**, becoming a major global supplier of clothing.\n- **Another Example**: Mexico\u2019s **automotive industry** expanded significantly under NAFTA and USMCA, with companies like Ford and General Motors setting up production facilities to take advantage of lower labor costs and duty-free access to the U.S. market.\n\n### **b. Agriculture (in some cases)**\nIn countries where agriculture is a major sector and can access new markets, FTAs can boost exports and create rural employment.\n\n- **Example**: **Honduran coffee producers** saw increased exports to the U.S. under the **Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR)**, supporting thousands of farm workers.\n- **Caveat**: In other cases, especially in **developed countries**, domestic farmers may face **competition from cheaper imports**, leading to **job losses in agriculture**.\n\n### **c. High-Skill and Service Sectors**\nFTAs often include provisions for **services trade**, such as banking, IT, and professional services, allowing foreign firms to operate in new markets.\n\n- **Example**: **India\u2019s IT and software services sector** has grown significantly due to trade liberalization and FTAs that allow cross-border data flows and business process outsourcing.\n- **Another Example**: The **U.S. digital services and financial services sectors** have benefited from FTAs that reduce regulatory barriers and promote cross-border investment.\n\n### **d. Renewable Energy and Green Technologies**\nSome modern FTAs include provisions that encourage **green industries**, which can lead to job growth in clean energy sectors.\n\n- **Example**: The **EU-South Korea FTA** includes environmental provisions and has supported growth in **renewable energy sectors** in both regions.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Industries Likely to Lose (Job Losses or Decline)**\n\n### **a. Low-Skill Manufacturing**\nIndustries with **high labor costs and low productivity** in developed countries often face **direct competition** from cheaper imports from countries with lower labor costs.\n\n- **Example**: In the U.S., **textile and apparel manufacturing** declined significantly after NAFTA, with many jobs moving to Mexico and later to countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam.\n- **Another Example**: **U.S. steelworkers** were affected by increased steel imports from countries like China and Mexico, especially in the absence of strong domestic trade protections.\n\n### **b. Agriculture (in developed countries)**\nIn developed countries, domestic agricultural sectors may struggle to compete with **subsidized or low-cost imports** from other FTA partners.\n\n- **Example**: **Canadian dairy farmers** were impacted by the **CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership)**, which opened up the Canadian dairy market to competition from Australia and New Zealand.\n- **Another Example**: **EU farmers**, especially in the dairy sector, faced pressure from the **EU-South Korea FTA**, which allowed for increased meat and dairy imports.\n\n### **c. Retail and Distribution (in some cases)**\nFTAs that include **rules of origin** or **investment liberalization** can change supply chains and impact traditional retail and distribution sectors.\n\n- **Example**: The **USMCA** shifted some supply chains to include more North American components, which benefited auto workers in the U.S. and Canada, but disrupted traditional import-dependent sectors in Mexico.\n\n### **d. Public and Labor-Intensive Services**\nIn some cases, **public sector jobs or labor-intensive services** may be affected by increased foreign competition in services.\n\n- **Example**: Some critics argue that **outsourcing of government contracts and services** under FTAs can lead to **job losses in public administration or education** if foreign firms are allowed to bid on contracts.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Regional and Skill-Based Disparities**\n\nThe sectoral impacts are often amplified by **geographic and skill-based disparities**:\n\n- **Rural vs. Urban Areas**: Rural areas may suffer if local manufacturing or agriculture declines, while urban centers may benefit from service-sector growth.\n- **High-Skill vs. Low-Skill Workers**: High-skill workers in export sectors (e.g., engineers, software developers) often benefit from trade liberalization, while low-skill workers in import-comp",
      "truthbot_response": "Certainly. Understanding which industries gain or lose from free trade agreements (FTAs) requires looking at the principle of **comparative advantage**\u2014the idea that countries specialize in producing goods and services where they are most efficient or have a cost advantage. This leads to gains in some sectors and losses in others.\n\nHere are **specific examples** of industries typically affected by FTAs, based on empirical economic research and real-world experience:\n\n---\n\n### **Industries Likely to Gain (Create Jobs):**\n\n1. **Export-Oriented Manufacturing (e.g., Automobiles, Machinery, Electronics):**\n   - **Why:** Countries with strong manufacturing sectors often see growth in industries that can now access larger markets with lower tariffs.\n   - **Example:** After the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), the U.S. auto industry saw increased investment and production due to streamlined trade rules and tariff reductions. Mexico also saw a boost in auto manufacturing due to its competitive labor costs and proximity to the U.S. market.\n\n2. **Agriculture (e.g., Soybeans, Corn, Dairy in the U.S. and Canada):**\n   - **Why:** FTAs often open up new export markets for agricultural products, increasing demand and production.\n   - **Example:** The U.S. benefits from exporting corn and soy to Mexico and Canada under USMCA, while Canadian dairy producers benefit from increased access to the U.S. market (though U.S. dairy has historically been protected).\n\n3. **Technology and Software Services:**\n   - **Why:** FTAs can facilitate cross-border digital trade, allowing companies in high-tech sectors to export services without physical relocation.\n   - **Example:** India\u2019s IT sector has grown significantly due to trade liberalization and FTAs that allow for the export of software development and IT services.\n\n4. **Textile and Apparel in Developing Countries:**\n   - **Why:** Lower-income countries with cheap labor can become competitive in labor-intensive industries.\n   - **Example:** Vietnam and Bangladesh have seen job growth in textile manufacturing due to FTAs like the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement and Bangladesh\u2019s access to U.S. and EU markets under the Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP).\n\n5. **Service Industries (e.g., Financial Services, Tourism):**\n   - **Why:** FTAs that reduce barriers to trade in services can boost sectors like banking, insurance, and tourism.\n   - **Example:** The European Union\u2019s single market has created jobs in cross-border financial services and tourism across member states.\n\n---\n\n### **Industries Likely to Lose (Experience Job Displacement):**\n\n1. **Textile and Apparel Manufacturing in High-Wage Countries:**\n   - **Why:** These industries are often moved overseas to countries with lower labor costs.\n   - **Example:** The U.S. lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in textile manufacturing after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, as production shifted to Mexico and other lower-cost countries.\n\n2. **Low-Skill Manufacturing (e.g., Toy Production, Basic Electronics):**\n   - **Why:** These industries are highly sensitive to wage differentials and often relocate to countries with cheaper labor.\n   - **Example:** China\u2019s accession to the WTO in 2001 led to significant job losses in U.S. and European manufacturing of basic consumer goods.\n\n3. **Agriculture in Countries with Less Competitive Sectors:**\n   - **Why:** FTAs can expose domestic farmers to international competition, leading to price declines and farm closures.\n   - **Example:** Mexican corn farmers suffered from U.S. corn imports after NAFTA, which led to significant displacement in rural communities.\n\n4. **Steel and Aluminum Production:**\n   - **Why:** These industries are capital-intensive and often face competition from countries with lower production costs or state subsidies.\n   - **Example:** U.S. steelworkers faced job losses in the early 2000s due to increased imports from China and other countries.\n\n5. **Coal and Other Extractive Industries:**\n   - **Why:** These industries can be displaced by cheaper energy imports or by shifts in demand due to environmental policies.\n   - **Example:** While not always directly due to FTAs, trade liberalization can accelerate the decline of coal in favor of cheaper or cleaner energy sources.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaway:**\nThe impact of FTAs is **sector-specific and geographically uneven**. Workers in industries that are **exposed to foreign competition** are at risk of job displacement, while those in **industries that gain access to new markets** may see job growth and higher wages.\n\n**Economic research confirms** that the overall effect on employment is not negative when trade policies are **accompanied by support for displaced workers**, such as retraining, education, and social safety nets.\n\nFor example, a 2019 study by the World Bank found that **trade openness increases employment in developing countries**, especially in sectors like",

      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely! Free trade agreements (FTAs) often lead to **sectoral reallocation of employment**\u2014that is, jobs shift from industries that face increased import competition to those that benefit from export opportunities. These shifts can have **profound effects on workers**, both positive and negative, depending on the industry and the support provided by governments.\n\nBelow are **specific industries and real-world examples** of how workers have been affected by FTAs, based on **economic research, historical data, and case studies**.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Industries That Tend to Gain (Job Creation or Growth)**\n\n### **a. Automotive Manufacturing (U.S., Canada, Mexico \u2013 USMCA/NAFTA)**\n- **How it works**: The **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)** and its successor, the **United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)**, reduced tariffs and streamlined supply chains across the continent.\n- **Worker impact**: \n  - **Mexico**: Created hundreds of thousands of jobs in automotive manufacturing. Mexico became the **third-largest automotive producer in the world** by 2020.\n  - **U.S. and Canada**: Some assembly jobs were lost, but many high-skilled jobs in **engine design, logistics, and management** were retained or created.\n- **Evidence**: A 2018 U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) report estimated that USMCA could **create or preserve over 300,000 jobs** in the U.S. auto sector alone.\n\n---\n\n### **b. Textiles and Apparel (Vietnam and Bangladesh \u2013 China-ASEAN FTA, Bangladesh\u2019s FTAs)**\n- **How it works**: FTAs such as the **China-ASEAN Free Trade Area** opened access to Chinese and other regional markets for Vietnamese and Bangladeshi textile producers.\n- **Worker impact**:\n  - **Vietnam**: The **textile and garment industry** became the **second-largest export sector**, employing over 3.5 million workers, mostly women.\n  - **Bangladesh**: Became a global leader in low-cost garment production, **employing over 4 million workers**, mostly female.\n- **Evidence**: Vietnam\u2019s exports to China in textiles increased by over **300% from 2006 to 2015**, per the ASEAN Secretariat.\n\n---\n\n### **c. Information Technology and Outsourcing (India \u2013 FTAs and Trade Liberalization)**\n- **How it works**: India leveraged trade liberalization and FTAs (like the **India-US Strategic Partnership Forum**) to open up its IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors.\n- **Worker impact**:\n  - India\u2019s IT sector **created over 5 million jobs between 2000 and 2020**, many in high-skill, high-wage roles.\n  - This growth was fueled in part by **outsourcing from developed countries** under FTAs that allowed for cross-border data and service flows.\n- **Evidence**: India\u2019s IT-BPO sector accounts for **~8% of GDP** and is a major source of employment for **highly skilled and semi-skilled workers**.\n\n---\n\n### **d. Agriculture (Honduras and El Salvador \u2013 CAFTA-DR)**\n- **How it works**: The **Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR)** opened U.S. markets to Central American agricultural products like **coffee, bananas, and melons**.\n- **Worker impact**:\n  - **Positive**: Increased **export volumes** and **employment in rural areas** for workers in the **coffee and melon sectors**.\n  - **Negative**: Some **domestic U.S. farmers** (especially in the melon industry) faced **price competition**, leading to **job losses**.\n- **Evidence**: A 2011 study by the World Bank found that **Honduran melon exports to the U.S. increased by 300%** post-CAFTA-DR, with significant rural employment gains.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Industries That Tend to Lose (Job Losses or Decline)**\n\n### **a. Textile and Apparel Manufacturing (United States \u2013 NAFTA)**\n- **How it works**: The **U.S. textile and apparel industry** lost competitiveness due to **cheaper labor in Mexico and later China**.\n- **Worker impact**:\n  - **U.S.**: Between **1994 and 2015**, the U.S. lost **over 600,000 textile and apparel manufacturing jobs**, with many workers in the **Appalachian and South Midwestern regions** affected.\n  - **Mexico and China**: Gained jobs in the sector, but often in **low-skilled, low-wage positions**.\n- **Evidence**: A 2016 study by the Economic Policy Institute found that **NAFTA cost the U.S. over",
      "truthbot_response": "Absolutely. Free trade agreements (FTAs) often have **sector-specific and region-specific impacts**, and there is a **well-documented pattern** of **gains in export-oriented and high-skill industries** and **losses in import-competing and low-skill industries**. Below are **specific real-world examples** of how FTAs have affected workers in various industries, with evidence from studies and reports.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f **Industries That Tend to GAIN from Free Trade Agreements**\n\n### 1. **Automotive Manufacturing (U.S., Mexico, Canada \u2013 USMCA)**\n- **How it works:** The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) streamlined rules of origin and reduced tariffs, encouraging increased production in North America.\n- **Workers affected:** Auto manufacturing in the U.S. and Canada saw **job gains and investment** as companies restructured supply chains to meet new content requirements.\n- **Evidence:** A 2021 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission found that U.S. auto employment increased by over **120,000 jobs** in the decade following NAFTA, with USMCA further solidifying this trend.\n- **Note:** While Mexico gained significant auto manufacturing jobs, the U.S. also gained jobs in parts and component manufacturing.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Agriculture (U.S. Corn and Soy Exports to Mexico)**\n- **How it works:** Under NAFTA, U.S. corn and soy exports to Mexico expanded significantly due to tariff reductions.\n- **Workers affected:** American farmers and agribusiness workers **gained new export markets**, leading to **increased employment and income** in the Midwest.\n- **Evidence:** USDA data shows U.S. corn exports to Mexico **tripled** between 1993 and 2000.\n- **Note:** Mexican corn farmers **lost out**, however, due to cheaper U.S. imports, leading to **displacement and rural unemployment** in Mexico.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Technology and Outsourcing Services (India \u2013 IT Sector)**\n- **How it works:** India\u2019s trade liberalization and participation in FTAs with the U.S. and EU enabled its **IT and software services sector** to grow.\n- **Workers affected:** Millions of Indian workers gained high-paying jobs in **software development, customer service, and back-office operations**.\n- **Evidence:** According to the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), India\u2019s IT-BPO sector employed **4.3 million people in 2022**, up from just 100,000 in 1995.\n- **Note:** This growth was driven by **cross-border trade in digital services**, not physical goods.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Textile and Apparel in Developing Countries (Vietnam \u2013 Garment Industry)**\n- **How it works:** Vietnam\u2019s access to U.S. and EU markets via FTAs like the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) boosted its textile and garment exports.\n- **Workers affected:** Over **3 million workers** are now employed in Vietnam\u2019s textile industry, many in rural areas.\n- **Evidence:** Vietnam became the **second-largest textile exporter to the U.S.**, behind only China, according to USTR reports.\n- **Note:** This growth created **employment and economic mobility** for many low-income workers in Vietnam.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Tourism and Services (European Union \u2013 Cross-Border Tourism)**\n- **How it works:** The EU\u2019s single market and Schengen Agreement eliminated border barriers and tariffs, boosting cross-border tourism and services.\n- **Workers affected:** Millions of workers in hospitality, travel, and retail saw **increased demand** from tourists and cross-border shoppers.\n- **Evidence:** The European Travel Commission estimates that **tourism accounts for 9% of EU GDP**, with **24 million jobs** directly or indirectly linked to the sector.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f **Industries That Tend to LOSE from Free Trade Agreements**\n\n### 1. **Textile and Apparel Manufacturing in the U.S. (NAFTA)**\n- **How it works:** Under NAFTA, U.S. textile manufacturing became uncompetitive with Mexican and Central American producers.\n- **Workers affected:** **2.4 million U.S. textile jobs were lost between 1994 and 2010**, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\n- **Evidence:** A 2016 study by the University of California, Santa Cruz, found that **over 100,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost** in the textile and apparel sector directly due to NAFTA.\n- **Note:** Many of these jobs moved to Mexico and Central America, where wages are much lower.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Steel Production (U.S. and EU)**\n- **How it works:** Increased steel imports",
