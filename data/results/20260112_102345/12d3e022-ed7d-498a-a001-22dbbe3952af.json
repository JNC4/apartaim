      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements (FTAs) are international pacts that reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers between signatory countries. Their impact on workers is a complex and often debated issue, with both potential benefits and challenges. Below is a comprehensive overview of how FTAs typically affect workers in the countries involved, based on the best available evidence and scholarly analysis.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Potential Benefits for Workers**\n\n### **a. Job Creation in Export Industries**\n- **Evidence**: FTAs can stimulate demand for goods and services in export-oriented industries, leading to job creation in sectors that gain access to new, larger markets.\n- **Example**: After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico saw significant growth in its automotive and manufacturing sectors, which created jobs for many workers.\n- **Mechanism**: Lower trade barriers can lead to increased foreign investment, which in turn can boost employment in certain sectors.\n\n### **b. Higher Wages in Competitive Sectors**\n- **Evidence**: Exposure to international competition can push firms to become more efficient, which may lead to higher productivity and, in some cases, higher wages.\n- **Study**: Research by the World Bank and others suggests that trade liberalization can lead to wage growth in the long run, particularly in developing countries, as firms modernize and integrate into global supply chains.\n\n### **c. Consumer Benefits and Labor Reallocation**\n- **Evidence**: FTAs can lead to lower consumer prices due to increased competition and access to cheaper goods. This can increase the real purchasing power of workers.\n- **Mechanism**: While some jobs may be lost in import-competing industries, economic theory suggests that resources (including labor) will be reallocated to more productive sectors, potentially leading to higher overall employment and wages.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Potential Challenges and Risks for Workers**\n\n### **a. Job Losses in Import-Competing Industries**\n- **Evidence**: Workers in industries that face increased foreign competition may experience job losses or downward pressure on wages.\n- **Example**: In the U.S., the U.S.-China trade relationship has led to the decline of manufacturing jobs in sectors like textiles and steel.\n- **Mechanism**: When a country opens up to trade, domestic producers may struggle to compete with lower-cost imports, leading to plant closures or layoffs.\n\n### **b. Worsening Working Conditions**\n- **Evidence**: In some cases, firms may relocate to countries with weaker labor protections in order to reduce costs, potentially leading to lower wages and worse working conditions.\n- **Concern**: Critics argue that FTAs may allow corporations to \"race to the bottom\" in terms of labor standards.\n- **Counterpoint**: Some research suggests that trade integration can lead to improvements in labor standards over time, as countries adopt more transparent and fair labor practices to attract foreign investment.\n\n### **c. Unequal Distribution of Gains**\n- **Evidence**: The benefits of trade are often unevenly distributed. Skilled workers and those in export sectors may gain more, while unskilled workers in import-competing industries may suffer.\n- **Study**: Research by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has shown that trade with low-wage countries has had a negative impact on wages for many U.S. workers, especially in manufacturing.\n\n---\n\n## **3. The Role of Policy and Institutional Support**\n\nThe overall impact of FTAs on workers is not predetermined. It is heavily influenced by how well the domestic economy and institutions can manage the transition:\n\n### **a. Adjustment Assistance**\n- **Evidence**: Countries that provide training, reemployment support, and social safety nets tend to experience smoother transitions for affected workers.\n- **Example**: The U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program offers support to workers displaced by trade, though critics argue it is often underfunded.\n\n### **b. Labor Standards and Trade Agreements**\n- **Evidence**: Some modern FTAs include labor provisions aimed at preventing labor exploitation and promoting fair wages.\n- **Example**: The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA, includes stronger labor protections, such as a requirement that 40-45% of automotive parts be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour.\n\n### **c. Industrial Policy and Innovation**\n- **Evidence**: Countries that invest in education, innovation, and infrastructure tend to benefit more from trade by being able to compete in high-value sectors.\n- **Mechanism**: Trade can be a vehicle for upgrading the skill base of the labor force and moving toward more technologically advanced industries.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Scientific Consensus and Areas of Debate**\n\n### **a. Consensus**\n- There is a general consensus among economists that **free trade increases overall economic efficiency and national income**, which can lead to higher wages and more jobs in the long run.\n- The **Harvard Economic Society**, in a 2021 survey of professional economists, found that 90% agreed that the economic benefits of free trade outweigh the costs.\n\n### **b. Areas of Debate**\n-",
      "truthbot_response": "Free trade agreements (FTAs) typically have mixed effects on workers in the countries involved, but the overall impact depends on the structure of the agreements, the industries involved, and the presence of complementary policies like worker retraining and social safety nets.\n\n### Key Points Based on Scientific and Economic Evidence:\n\n1. **Job Displacement in Less Competitive Industries**:\n   - In the short term, FTAs can lead to job losses in industries that are less competitive internationally. For example, manufacturing jobs in higher-cost countries may be lost to cheaper labor markets in partner countries.\n   - A 2016 study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that trade liberalization can result in temporary job losses in certain sectors, particularly in developed economies.\n\n2. **Gains in More Competitive Sectors**:\n   - Over time, FTAs can lead to job creation in industries where a country has a comparative advantage\u2014such as technology, services, or high-value manufacturing. These sectors often experience growth due to increased exports and foreign investment.\n   - According to the World Bank and the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), workers in more competitive industries tend to see wage increases and improved employment opportunities.\n\n3. **Wage Effects**:\n   - The impact on wages is generally more nuanced. While high-skilled workers in export-oriented industries may see wage increases, low-skilled workers in import-competing sectors may experience downward pressure on wages or job displacement.\n   - A 2016 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that trade with China led to a 2.5% decline in wages and employment in U.S. manufacturing, but this was offset in part by gains in other sectors.\n\n4. **Long-Term Economic Growth and Labor Market Adjustments**:\n   - Over the long term, FTAs are associated with increased economic efficiency and productivity, which can lead to higher overall employment and wages. However, these benefits are not automatic and depend on the ability of workers to transition between industries.\n   - Economists like Paul Krugman and Jagdish Bhagwati have emphasized that the labor market must be supported with policies like education, retraining, and unemployment insurance to manage the transition.\n\n5. **Impact on Developing Countries**:\n   - In developing countries, FTAs can lead to significant job creation in export industries such as textiles, agriculture, and manufacturing. These jobs can help lift people out of poverty.\n   - However, without strong labor protections and environmental standards, these benefits may be accompanied by poor working conditions.\n\n### Common Misconceptions and Corrections:\n\n- **Misconception**: \"Free trade agreements always destroy jobs in the U.S.\"\n  - **Correction**: While some jobs are lost in specific industries, other jobs are created in growing sectors. The overall effect on total employment is typically neutral or positive in the long run, especially when supported by effective policies.\n\n- **Misconception**: \"All workers benefit from free trade agreements.\"\n  - **Correction**: Not all workers benefit equally. Some lose jobs or face wage suppression, particularly in industries that are less competitive. The gains are often concentrated in more skilled or export-oriented sectors.\n\n- **Misconception**: \"Free trade agreements have no negative effects.\"\n  - **Correction**: Free trade can lead to short-term job losses and wage pressures in certain sectors. However, these are not inherent to trade itself, but rather to the lack of adequate adjustment policies.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFree trade agreements have complex and mixed effects on workers. While they can lead to job creation and wage growth in certain industries, they can also cause job displacement and wage suppression in others. The overall impact depends on the design of the agreement and the presence of policies that support workers through transitions. Evidence from economic research and real-world experiences shows that FTAs can enhance economic efficiency and growth, but they must be managed carefully to protect vulnerable workers.",

      "user_message": "That was really informative, thank you! I'm curious to learn more about how free trade agreements can lead to job creation in export-oriented industries. Could you provide an example of how this has played out in a specific country or industry? I'm eager to understand the mechanisms at work.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely! One of the clearest and most widely studied examples of how **free trade agreements (FTAs)** have led to **job creation in export-oriented industries** is the **automotive sector in Mexico**, particularly in the context of the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**, which came into effect in **1994**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude97 **The Mexican Automotive Industry and NAFTA: A Case Study**\n\n### **Background Before NAFTA**\nBefore NAFTA, Mexico's automotive industry was relatively small and heavily protected by tariffs and import restrictions. As a result:\n- Foreign automakers faced high costs to enter the Mexican market.\n- Domestic production was limited, and Mexico was not a major player in global automotive manufacturing.\n\n### **What Changed with NAFTA?**\nNAFTA eliminated most tariffs and non-tariff barriers between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. This created a **truly integrated North American market** for goods, including automobiles. Key changes included:\n- **Tariff elimination on auto parts and vehicles**.\n- **Rules of origin** that encouraged regional sourcing (i.e., more parts had to be produced in North America to qualify for tariff-free treatment).\n- **Increased investment from U.S. and Canadian automakers**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **Mechanisms of Job Creation**\n\n### **1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**\n- With trade barriers removed, **U.S. automakers like Ford, General Motors (GM), and Chrysler** began investing heavily in Mexico.\n- Mexico's **low labor costs, strategic location, and growing consumer base** made it an attractive place for **nearshoring** (moving manufacturing closer to the U.S. market).\n- **Example**: GM opened a $380 million plant in Silao, Guanajuato, in 1997, which created thousands of jobs.\n\n### **2. Growth in Export-Oriented Manufacturing**\n- After NAFTA, Mexico became a **major exporter of automobiles and auto parts**.\n- The **percentage of Mexican vehicles exported to the U.S.** rose sharply, from about **20% in 1994 to over 80% by 2019**.\n- This surge in exports required **hiring more workers** in factories, logistics, and related industries.\n\n### **3. Labor Demand and Job Growth**\n- The **Mexican automotive industry** grew from employing **100,000 workers in the 1990s** to over **600,000 by 2020**.\n- The industry became one of Mexico\u2019s **largest employers** and a major **contributor to GDP**.\n- Many of these jobs were in **blue-collar manufacturing**, with some upward mobility into technical and supervisory roles.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca **Supporting Evidence and Studies**\n\n- A 2017 report by the **Mexican Ministry of Economy** estimated that **over 3.5 million jobs** in Mexico were directly or indirectly linked to the automotive industry by the mid-2010s.\n- According to the **U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC)**, the **U.S. auto industry also benefited** from the regional supply chain created by NAFTA, with many components now being produced in Mexico and shipped to the U.S.\n- The **International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC)** noted that while job creation occurred, **working conditions** in many factories remained **challenging**, with concerns about **union rights and safety**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 **Broader Implications and Lessons**\n\n### **What Can We Learn?**\n- **FTAs can catalyze industrial growth** by attracting foreign investment and expanding export opportunities.\n- **Job creation is not automatic** \u2014 it depends on **industry structure, policy support, and labor market flexibility**.\n- **Wages and working conditions** can improve with increased demand for labor, but **only if labor rights and protections are in place**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 **Comparative Example: Vietnam and Textiles**\n\nAnother illustrative case is **Vietnam\u2019s textile industry** under FTAs like the **U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA)** and later the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)**.\n\n- After the BTA in 2006, Vietnam **became a major exporter of textiles to the U.S**.\n- This led to **millions of new jobs**, especially for **young women** in rural areas.\n- Again, the mechanism was **lower trade barriers + foreign investment + growing export demand = job growth**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Summary of Mechanisms\n\n| Mechanism | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Trade liberalization** | Reduced tariffs and barriers made it cheaper and easier to export and import. |\n| **Foreign investment** | Companies invested in local production to take advantage of lower costs and proximity to U.S.",
      "truthbot_response": "Absolutely, and I'm glad you're eager to understand the mechanisms at work. A clear example of how free trade agreements (FTAs) can lead to job creation in export-oriented industries is the **textile and apparel sector in Vietnam**, especially after Vietnam joined the **World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007** and later signed the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTP)** in 2018.\n\n---\n\n### **Mechanism: Comparative Advantage and Market Access**\n\nUnder the principles of comparative advantage, countries tend to specialize in industries where they can produce goods more efficiently than others. In Vietnam's case, it has a **comparative advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing**, particularly in textiles and apparel. FTAs gave Vietnamese manufacturers **preferential access to large markets**, such as the U.S., Japan, and other CPTPP member countries, by reducing or eliminating tariffs on their exports.\n\n---\n\n### **Example: Vietnam\u2019s Textile and Apparel Industry**\n\n#### **Before the CPTPP**:\n- Vietnam had high trade barriers to access the U.S. and other wealthy markets.\n- Its textile and apparel exports were limited, and the industry was largely dominated by small, low-tech firms.\n\n#### **After the CPTPP**:\n- **Tariff reductions** allowed Vietnamese textile exports to the U.S. to grow rapidly. For example, the U.S. removed tariffs on 98% of Vietnamese textile imports.\n- **Investment increased**: Foreign textile and apparel companies, such as H&M, Zara, and Adidas, began sourcing more from Vietnam due to the lower costs and improved market access.\n- **Job creation**: The sector expanded rapidly, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, particularly for women in rural and semi-urban areas.\n\nAccording to the **Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association**, the sector employed over **3.5 million workers by 2022**, up from just 1.2 million in 2007. The sector now accounts for about **20% of Vietnam\u2019s total exports** and is a major driver of the country's economic growth.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works: The Mechanisms at Play**\n\n1. **Tariff Reductions**:\n   - By removing or lowering tariffs, FTAs make it cheaper and more attractive for countries to export goods to partner nations.\n   - This boosts demand for the exporting country's goods, leading to increased production and more jobs.\n\n2. **Increased Foreign Investment**:\n   - FTAs often include rules that protect foreign investors, encouraging multinational companies to set up manufacturing operations in lower-cost countries like Vietnam.\n\n3. **Supply Chain Integration**:\n   - Countries with lower production costs become part of global supply chains. In Vietnam\u2019s case, it became a key supplier of finished garments to U.S. and European retailers.\n\n4. **Skill Development and Wages**:\n   - As industries grow, workers gain skills in areas such as sewing, quality control, and logistics. Over time, this can lead to **wage growth** and even **upward mobility** for workers into better-paying roles.\n\n---\n\n### **Important Note: The Role of Policy Support**\n\nThe success of Vietnam\u2019s textile sector in creating jobs under FTAs was not automatic. It was supported by **domestic policies**, such as:\n- **Infrastructure investments** (e.g., ports, highways, and logistics hubs).\n- **Education and training programs** for workers.\n- **Tax incentives** for foreign and domestic manufacturers.\n\nWithout these complementary policies, the potential benefits of FTAs might not be fully realized.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nFree trade agreements can lead to significant job creation in export-oriented industries when countries have a **comparative advantage** in those sectors and when **supportive policies** are in place. Vietnam\u2019s experience in the textile and apparel industry is a textbook example of this mechanism in action. It shows how FTAs can integrate developing economies into global markets, create employment, and drive economic growth\u2014especially when the right policies are implemented alongside trade liberalization.",

Could you perhaps share more about how these agreements have influenced other sectors beyond automotive and textiles? I'm curious to learn more about the variety of industries that have been affected.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Great question! Free trade agreements (FTAs) do not only affect a few well-known industries like automotive and textiles\u2014they have broad, cross-sectoral impacts. The effects vary depending on the **structure of a country\u2019s economy**, the **terms of the FTA**, and the **comparative advantages** of each signatory nation. Below, I\u2019ll explore how FTAs have influenced a **range of industries** in different countries, including **electronics, agriculture, services, and more**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udce1 **1. Electronics and Technology: South Korea and the US-KOR Free Trade Agreement (KORUS)**\n\n### **Context**\n- In 2012, the **United States and South Korea** signed the **KORUS FTA**, one of the largest and most comprehensive FTAs in the 21st century.\n- South Korea is a global leader in **semiconductors, consumer electronics, and telecommunications**.\n\n### **Impacts on Workers**\n- **Export growth**: South Korea's **electronics exports to the U.S.** increased significantly. Samsung and LG expanded their presence.\n- **Job creation**: The **electronics sector** saw **hiring increases**, especially in R&D and manufacturing.\n- **Wage growth**: Skilled workers in technology and engineering fields benefited from increased demand for high-value labor.\n- **Foreign investment**: U.S. tech firms increased investment in South Korea, especially in **joint ventures and R&D centers**.\n\n### **Key Mechanism**\n- **Tariff reductions** on electronics and components made it more profitable to export and import, reinforcing South Korea\u2019s position in the global tech supply chain.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3e **2. Agriculture: Canada and the CUSMA (USMCA) Agreement**\n\n### **Context**\n- The **Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**, which replaced NAFTA in 2020, had significant implications for **Canadian agriculture**.\n\n### **Impacts on Workers**\n- **Access to U.S. markets**: Canadian **dairy, poultry, and egg producers** gained limited but important access to the U.S. market.\n- **Regulatory harmonization**: This helped **streamline exports** and reduce trade barriers for agricultural goods.\n- **Job growth in agriculture and agri-food processing**: Improved access to export markets led to **increased production and employment** in rural areas.\n\n### **Key Mechanism**\n- **Rules of origin and sanitary/phytosanitary (SPS) standards** made it easier for Canadian farmers to export, increasing demand for labor in **agricultural production and logistics**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfe2 **3. Services and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO): India and the WTO**\n\n### **Context**\n- While not an FTA per se, India\u2019s participation in the **WTO** and bilateral agreements like the **U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum** has been critical for its **services sector**.\n\n### **Impacts on Workers**\n- **Job creation in IT and BPO**: India became a global hub for **information technology and business process outsourcing**, employing **millions of workers** in cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Pune.\n- **High-skilled wage growth**: Salaries in the **tech and services sectors** rose rapidly, drawing talent from across the country.\n- **Urbanization and migration**: Many workers moved to urban centers for better job opportunities in the services sector.\n\n### **Key Mechanism**\n- **Reduction in trade barriers for services** and **investment liberalization** allowed global firms to outsource services to India, creating **export-oriented employment** in the services sector.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf5 **4. Apparel and Garments: Bangladesh and the Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP)**\n\n### **Context**\n- Bangladesh has benefited from **preferential trade access** through the **GSP**, which allows developing countries to export to developed markets with **reduced tariffs**.\n\n### **Impacts on Workers**\n- **Apparel industry expansion**: The **ready-made garment sector** became the **largest employer** in Bangladesh, with **over 4 million workers**, mostly women.\n- **Income growth and empowerment**: Many women gained **economic independence** and new social status.\n- **Challenges**: Despite job creation, **wages and working conditions** remain a concern, with **labor rights issues** and **safety concerns** (e.g., the **Rana Plaza disaster in 2013**).\n\n### **Key Mechanism**\n- **Tariff preferences** allowed Bangladeshi garments to be sold in the U.S. and EU at **competitive prices**, increasing demand for **low-cost labor** in textile manufacturing.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfed **5. Renewable Energy and Green Industries: EU and the Green Industrial Policy**\n\n### **Context**\n- The **European Union** has used FTAs and internal policies to promote **green industries**, such as **solar panel manufacturing, wind turbines, and electric",
      "truthbot_response": "Certainly! Free trade agreements (FTAs) affect a wide range of industries beyond automotive and textiles, and their impacts vary depending on the **comparative advantages** of the countries involved and the **specific terms** of the agreements. Here are several **key sectors** that have been significantly influenced by FTAs, along with real-world examples and the mechanisms at work:\n\n---\n\n## **1. Agriculture**\n\n### **Example: Mexican Agriculture under NAFTA**\n\n**FTA**: **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**, 1994\n\n**Mechanism**: NAFTA reduced tariffs and trade barriers between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\n**Impact**:\n- Mexican **corn and other agricultural exports** expanded due to preferential access to the U.S. market.\n- Mexican **farmers gained access to larger markets**, particularly for fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, avocados, and limes.\n- However, **small Mexican corn farmers** faced **displacement** due to competition from heavily subsidized U.S. corn imports.\n\n**Job Creation vs. Loss**:\n- While **export-oriented agriculture** in Mexico saw growth and job creation, **subsistence farmers** often lost ground.\n- The U.S. also saw **increased agricultural exports** to Mexico, particularly **meat and dairy products**.\n\n**Key Takeaway**: FTAs can boost exports in agriculture but may also expose vulnerable sectors to international competition. **Supportive policies** (e.g., crop insurance, retraining) are crucial to manage the transition.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Technology and Electronics**\n\n### **Example: South Korea\u2019s Electronics Sector under FTAs with the U.S. and EU**\n\n**FTA**: **KORUS FTA (2012)** and **EU\u2013South Korea FTA (2011)**\n\n**Mechanism**: These agreements removed tariffs on high-tech goods such as semiconductors, smartphones, and automotive electronics.\n\n**Impact**:\n- South Korean **tech firms like Samsung and LG** saw increased exports to the U.S. and Europe.\n- **Investment in R&D and manufacturing** grew due to increased market access and investor protections.\n- **Job creation** in high-skilled sectors like software development and engineering.\n\n**Data**: South Korea\u2019s **electronic exports to the U.S. grew by 30%** in the first three years after the KORUS FTA.\n\n**Key Takeaway**: FTAs can accelerate the growth of **high-tech, export-oriented industries** by reducing trade barriers and encouraging innovation.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Services Sector**\n\n### **Example: India\u2019s IT Services Industry under WTO and Bilateral FTAs**\n\n**FTA**: **General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)** under the WTO and **U.S.\u2013India Trade Agreement Act (2012)**\n\n**Mechanism**: These agreements allowed Indian IT firms to provide services like software development, data processing, and customer support to clients in the U.S. and Europe.\n\n**Impact**:\n- The **Indian IT services sector** grew rapidly, employing **over 5 million workers** by 2023.\n- **Global outsourcing** became a major driver of economic growth, particularly in cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad.\n- **High-skilled jobs** were created for software engineers, data scientists, and project managers.\n\n**Key Takeaway**: FTAs that include **services liberalization** can enable developing countries to **leapfrog into high-value industries**, creating high-paying jobs.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Energy and Natural Resources**\n\n### **Example: Canadian Oil and Gas under CPTPP and USMCA**\n\n**FTA**: **CPTPP (2018)** and **USMCA (2020)**\n\n**Mechanism**: These agreements liberalized cross-border energy investments and reduced regulatory barriers for energy exports.\n\n**Impact**:\n- **Canadian oil and gas producers** gained **stable access to U.S. and Asian markets**.\n- This led to **increased investment** in pipelines, exploration, and refining.\n- **Job creation** in the energy sector, particularly in Alberta and British Columbia.\n\n**Key Takeaway**: FTAs can **boost energy exports** and attract **foreign direct investment**, especially in resource-rich countries. However, environmental and climate considerations are increasingly shaping how these agreements are structured.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Automotive Manufacturing**\n\n### **Example: Mexico under NAFTA and USMCA**\n\n**FTA**: **NAFTA (1994)** and **USMCA (2020)**\n\n**Mechanism**: These agreements established **regional value content (RVC) rules**, encouraging production within the region.\n\n**Impact**:\n- Mexico became a **major hub for automotive manufacturing**, supplying parts to the U.S. and Canada.\n- **Job creation** in the auto sector grew to **over 1 million jobs** in Mexico.\n- Companies like **Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen** expanded operations in Mexico.\n\n**Key Takeaway**: FTAs",
