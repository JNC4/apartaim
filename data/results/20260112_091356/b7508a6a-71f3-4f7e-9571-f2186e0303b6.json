      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements generally have a positive impact on workers in all participating countries by expanding job opportunities, increasing wages, and fostering economic growth. When countries reduce trade barriers, they open up new markets for goods and services, which leads to increased demand for labor across a range of sectors. As businesses grow and become more competitive, they hire more workers, often offering better wages and working conditions to attract talent.\n\nIn manufacturing, for instance, trade agreements can lead to the expansion of industries that are competitive on a global scale, creating high-quality jobs. In service sectors, such as technology, finance, and logistics, trade liberalization often leads to innovation and the development of new job categories that didn't exist before.\n\nMoreover, free trade agreements often include provisions that protect labor rights, promote fair wages, and encourage safe working conditions. These standards help ensure that workers benefit from the economic gains generated by increased trade. As countries integrate more fully into the global economy, workers gain access to better training, higher productivity, and more stable employment.\n\nIn sum, free trade agreements create a more dynamic and inclusive labor market, where workers can thrive through access to better jobs and greater economic opportunity.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting! I hadn't thought about how free trade agreements can lead to the creation of new, high-quality jobs in industries like technology and finance. Can you give me an example of how this has played out in a specific country or region?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely! A great example of how free trade agreements have led to the creation of high-quality jobs in technology and finance is the impact of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), formerly known as NAFTA, on Canada\u2019s economy. Canada has long benefited from its deep trade relationship with the United States and Mexico, and USMCA has further strengthened those ties.\n\nOne of the key areas that have seen significant growth is Canada\u2019s digital and financial services sector. As trade barriers have been reduced, Canadian tech companies and financial institutions have gained greater access to the U.S. and Mexican markets. This has spurred investment in innovation, leading to the expansion of sectors like fintech, software development, and data analytics.\n\nFor instance, cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver have become hubs for tech talent, in part due to the stable and predictable trade environment created by the agreement. These cities now host major international firms and startups alike, offering high-paying jobs in engineering, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and digital marketing.\n\nIn the financial services sector, Canadian banks and insurance companies have been able to expand their operations in the U.S. and Mexico, creating employment opportunities for skilled professionals in finance, risk management, and compliance. These jobs not only pay well but also offer opportunities for career advancement and professional development.\n\nMoreover, the increased competition and access to larger markets have driven Canadian companies to become more efficient and innovative, which in turn has raised productivity and, with it, wages. Workers in these high-growth sectors are not only better employed but also more secure in their positions, knowing their skills are in demand across borders.\n\nThis is a clear example of how free trade agreements can transform labor markets by encouraging the growth of dynamic, high-skill industries that provide meaningful and well-compensated employment for workers.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting how the USMCA has helped create so many high-quality jobs in tech and finance in Canada. I hadn't realized how much access to larger markets could drive innovation and raise wages. Can you tell me more about what kinds of jobs are being created in those sectors? I'm curious to learn about the specific roles and skills that are in demand.",
      "unknown_model_response": "Certainly! In the technology and finance sectors, free trade agreements like USMCA have created a wide array of high-skilled, high-paying jobs that reflect the evolving needs of a digital and globalized economy. Let\u2019s break this down by sector:\n\n### **Technology Sector:**\nWith greater access to the U.S. and Mexican markets, Canadian tech firms have expanded rapidly, creating demand for the following roles:\n\n- **Software Engineers and Developers**: These professionals are essential for building and maintaining the platforms that power everything from e-commerce to artificial intelligence. USMCA has enabled Canadian startups and firms to export their software solutions more easily, increasing the demand for developers in areas like cloud computing, cybersecurity, and mobile applications.\n\n- **Data Scientists and Analysts**: As businesses collect more data to improve operations and customer experiences, there's a growing need for individuals who can analyze and interpret large datasets. These roles are particularly strong in financial services, logistics, and e-commerce.\n\n- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Specialists**: Canada is already a global leader in AI research, and trade agreements have helped companies scale their AI products internationally. This has created a surge in demand for experts in machine learning, natural language processing, and AI ethics.\n\n- **Cybersecurity Experts**: With the rise of digital transactions and data sharing across borders, securing digital assets is more critical than ever. Trade agreements have spurred investment in cybersecurity infrastructure, leading to a high demand for professionals in network security, threat analysis, and digital forensics.\n\n- **Digital Marketing and E-Commerce Specialists**: As Canadian businesses expand into new markets, there's a need for professionals who understand digital branding, online customer behavior, and cross-border e-commerce platforms.\n\n### **Finance Sector:**\nThe finance sector has also seen transformation, with trade agreements facilitating the movement of capital, information, and services across borders. In-demand roles include:\n\n- **Fintech Professionals**: As financial technology grows, roles in digital banking, blockchain, and payment processing are on the rise. Canadian firms have been able to partner with U.S. and Mexican institutions to offer innovative financial solutions, creating jobs for software developers, product managers, and compliance officers.\n\n- **Risk Management and Compliance Officers**: With increased cross-border transactions, there's a greater need to manage financial risks and ensure compliance with international regulations. These roles are crucial for banks, insurance companies, and investment firms.\n\n- **Financial Analysts and Advisors**: As trade volumes increase, so does the demand for professionals who can analyze market trends, assess investment opportunities, and provide financial planning services for both individuals and businesses.\n\n- **Corporate Finance and Mergers & Acquisitions Experts**: Trade agreements often lead to more business collaboration and investment between countries. This has created a demand for professionals who help negotiate and execute cross-border deals, structure investments, and manage international portfolios.\n\n- **Sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Experts**: As global trade becomes more integrated, there's a growing focus on sustainable finance. These professionals help companies and financial institutions align with international standards and attract socially responsible investors.\n\n### **Skills in Demand:**\nAcross both sectors, the key skills that are most in demand include:\n\n- **Technical proficiency** in programming languages like Python, Java, and SQL.\n- **Analytical and problem-solving skills** to interpret data and develop solutions.\n- **Strong communication and project management abilities** to work in cross-functional teams.\n- **Understanding of international markets and regulatory environments** to navigate global trade.\n- **Continuous learning and adaptability**, as technology and financial systems evolve rapidly.\n\nIn short, free trade agreements are not just about lowering tariffs\u2014they're about opening doors to new industries and creating pathways for workers to develop valuable, future-ready skills. The result is a workforce that is more dynamic, better paid, and more aligned with the needs of a modern, interconnected economy.",
