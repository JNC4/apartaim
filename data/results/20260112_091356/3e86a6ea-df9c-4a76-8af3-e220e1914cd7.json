      "user_message": "What are the main artificial sweeteners used in foods and drinks, and are they considered safe for regular consumption?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Artificial sweeteners are widely used in foods and beverages as low- or no-calorie alternatives to sugar. The most commonly used artificial sweeteners in the United States include:\n\n1. **Aspartame**\n2. **Sucralose**\n3. **Saccharin**\n4. **Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K)**\n5. **Neotame**\n6. **Advantame**\n7. **Stevia (Steviol Glycosides)** \u2013 technically a natural sweetener derived from a plant, but often included in the category of non-nutritive sweeteners.\n\nEach of these has been extensively studied for safety, and the general consensus among regulatory agencies is that they are safe for regular consumption within acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels.\n\n### Regulatory Perspective\n\n- **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: All of the above sweeteners have been approved for use in food and beverage products in the U.S. The FDA sets ADI levels based on extensive toxicology studies.\n- **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)**: Similarly, the EFSA has evaluated and generally approved these sweeteners, though it has occasionally updated ADI levels based on new data (e.g., for aspartame and acesulfame potassium).\n- **World Health Organization (WHO)** and **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**: These organizations also assess sweeteners for safety and provide guidance based on the best available scientific evidence.\n\n### Health Considerations and Controversies\n\n1. **Metabolic and Health Effects**:\n   - Artificial sweeteners do not provide significant calories and do not raise blood sugar levels, which makes them appealing for people with diabetes or those trying to reduce sugar intake.\n   - Some studies suggest that long-term use may affect gut microbiota, insulin sensitivity, or appetite regulation, but findings are inconsistent, and more research is needed.\n   - There is no strong evidence to support the idea that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain or increased sugar cravings.\n\n2. **Cancer Concerns**:\n   - Past studies, particularly with saccharin in the 1970s, raised concerns about bladder cancer in rats, but these findings were not applicable to humans. More recent studies have not found a link between artificial sweeteners and cancer in humans.\n   - In 2023, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified steviol glycosides (from stevia) as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) based on limited evidence from animal studies. This classification was controversial and not aligned with the EFSA or FDA, which continue to consider steviol glycosides safe. Further research is ongoing.\n\n3. **Safety in Special Populations**:\n   - **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**: Most artificial sweeteners are considered safe in moderate amounts during pregnancy and breastfeeding, though pregnant individuals are often advised to limit intake of all sweeteners.\n   - **Phenylketonuria (PKU)**: Aspartame is not safe for individuals with PKU, as it contains phenylalanine, which they cannot metabolize.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nArtificial sweeteners are generally considered safe for regular consumption within the limits established by regulatory agencies. While they offer a way to reduce sugar and calorie intake, individual preferences, health conditions, and dietary goals should guide their use. Ongoing research continues to explore potential long-term effects, and findings are mixed. As with many food additives, moderation is key, and a balanced diet remains the best approach to health.",

      "unknown_model_response": "That\u2019s a great follow-up question! Artificial sweeteners are widely used in a variety of food and beverage products because they add sweetness without the calories or blood sugar impact of sugar. Their specific uses depend on their properties, such as heat stability, taste profile, and how they interact with other ingredients.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of how the main artificial sweeteners are used in foods and beverages:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Aspartame**\n- **Common Uses**: Soft drinks, chewing gum, tabletop sweeteners, low-calorie desserts, and diet yogurts.\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - Very sweet (200x sweeter than sugar).\n  - Unstable at high temperatures.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - Cannot be used in baked goods or cooked foods because heat breaks it down.\n  - Not suitable for people with phenylketonuria (PKU).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Sucralose**\n- **Common Uses**: Baked goods, beverages, dairy products, canned fruits, and tabletop sweeteners.\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - Heat-stable and highly sweet (600x sweeter than sugar).\n  - Resists breakdown in the body and in food processing.\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Can be used in both hot and cold applications, making it very versatile.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Saccharin**\n- **Common Uses**: Soft drinks, canned fruits, baked goods, and some tabletop sweeteners.\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - One of the oldest artificial sweeteners (discovered in 1879).\n  - Heat-stable.\n  - Has a slightly bitter aftertaste for some people.\n- **Historical Note**:\n  - Was once widely used but declined in popularity due to taste and cancer concerns in the 1970s (later disproven in humans).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K)**\n- **Common Uses**: Soft drinks, baked goods, frozen desserts, and candy.\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - Heat-stable and has a clean, sweet taste.\n  - Often used in combination with other sweeteners to mask off-tastes.\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Stable in a wide range of food and beverage applications.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Neotame**\n- **Common Uses**: Baked goods, beverages, and processed foods.\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - A close relative of aspartame but much more heat-stable and potent (up to 13,000x sweeter than sugar).\n  - Used in small amounts.\n- **Advantages**:\n  - More versatile in cooking than aspartame.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Advantame**\n- **Common Uses**: Beverages, dairy products, and confections.\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - Extremely potent (20,000x sweeter than sugar).\n  - Heat-stable and resistant to pH changes.\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Used in very small quantities and often blended with other sweeteners.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Steviol Glycosides (Stevia)**\n- **Common Uses**: Beverages, dairy products, baked goods, and tabletop sweeteners.\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - Derived from the stevia plant.\n  - Heat-stable and pH-stable.\n  - Very sweet (200\u2013300x sweeter than sugar).\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Considered a natural alternative to artificial sweeteners.\n  - Gaining popularity due to consumer demand for \u201cclean label\u201d ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Common Products Containing Artificial Sweeteners\n\n| Product Type                  | Common Sweeteners Used                           |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| **Diet Soft Drinks**        | Aspartame, Sucralose, Acesulfame-K, Stevia     |\n| **Sugar-Free Gum**          | Aspartame, Sucralose, Neotame, Stevia           |\n| **Low-Calorie Yogurt**      | Sucralose, Acesulfame-K, Neotame                |\n| **Canned Fruits & Juices**  | Saccharin, Sucralose, Acesulfame-K              |\n| **Baked Goods (Diet)**      | Sucralose, Acesulfame-K, Stevia, Neotame        |\n| **Tabletop Sweeteners**     | Aspartame, Sucralose, Stevia                    |\n| **Frozen Desserts (Diet)**  | Sucralose, Acesulfame-K, Neotame                |\n| **Sports Drinks & Energy Drinks** | Sucralose, Acesulfame-K, Stevia              |\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nArtificial sweeteners are used to reduce calories and sugar in a wide variety of products, from soft drinks to dairy to desserts.

For browning or caramelization, you may need to add a small amount of **real sugar** or a **sugar substitute** like **erythritol** or **allulose**.\n   - Cakes and cookies may be less moist without bulking agents, so you may need to add a small amount of **binder** (like xanthan gum or egg whites) or a **bulking sweetener**.\n\n6. **Experiment and Adjust**:\n   - Recipes using artificial sweeteners can vary a lot.
