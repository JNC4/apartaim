      "unknown_model_response": "Economic sanctions are a widely used tool of foreign policy, intended to pressure targeted countries into changing specific behaviors without resorting to military conflict. Their effectiveness, however, is a topic of significant debate among policymakers, scholars, and practitioners. Below is a comprehensive analysis of the evidence and arguments surrounding the effectiveness of economic sanctions at changing the behavior of targeted countries.\n\n---\n\n## I. **Overview of Economic Sanctions**\n\nEconomic sanctions are economic penalties imposed by one or more countries (or international organizations) against a targeted country, entity, or individual. These penalties can include:\n- Trade embargoes\n- Financial restrictions (e.g., freezing assets, cutting off access to financial systems)\n- Travel bans\n- Investment restrictions\n\nSanctions are typically used in response to:\n- Violations of international law (e.g., human rights abuses, aggression)\n- Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\n- Cyberattacks\n- Electoral fraud or repression\n\n---\n\n## II. **Arguments in Favor of Effectiveness**\n\n### 1. **Some Sanctions Have Been Successful**\n\nThere are documented cases where economic sanctions have led to changes in state behavior. Notable examples include:\n\n- **South Africa (1980s\u20131990s)**: Comprehensive international sanctions contributed to the end of apartheid.\n- **Iran (2010\u20132018)**: The P5+1 (including the U.S.) imposed extensive sanctions that pressured Iran to agree to the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA).\n- **Sudan (2000s\u20132017)**: U.S. sanctions were credited with pressuring Sudan to cooperate with the International Criminal Court and cease support for regional insurgencies.\n\n### 2. **High-Cost Sanctions Can Be Effective**\n\nResearch by scholars such as **David Cortright** and **George Breslauer** suggests that:\n- Sanctions are more likely to succeed when they are **broad and comprehensive**, especially when they cut off access to international financial systems.\n- Sanctions are more effective when **multilateral** (e.g., imposed by the UN or a broad coalition of countries), as they increase the economic pressure on the target.\n\n### 3. **Economic and Political Costs Can Influence Regime Behavior**\n\n- Sanctions can cause economic hardship for the ruling elite, making them more willing to negotiate or compromise.\n- In some cases, sanctions may **undermine public support** for a regime or provoke domestic unrest (e.g., in Iraq in the 1990s or North Korea).\n\n---\n\n## III. **Arguments Against Effectiveness**\n\n### 1. **Most Sanctions Fail to Achieve Their Goals**\n\nAccording to a widely cited 2003 study by **Robert Pape**, an associate professor at the University of Chicago:\n- Of 246 U.S. sanctions cases from 1914 to 1999, **only 3% resulted in the desired policy outcome**.\n- In 90% of cases, the targeted country **did not comply** with the demands.\n\nPape concluded that sanctions are rarely an effective tool of coercion and are often used more for political signaling than for actual policy change.\n\n### 2. **Sanctions Can Harm Civilians and Undermine Legitimacy**\n\n- Sanctions often hurt the **civilian population** more than the ruling regime. For example, sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s were linked to increased child mortality.\n- This can **undermine the moral legitimacy** of the sanctioning countries and backfire on the intended goals.\n\n### 3. **Regimes May Adapt and Become More Resilient**\n\n- Sanctions can prompt targeted states to **diversify trade**, build **self-reliance**, or strengthen ties with alternative partners (e.g., China, Russia).\n- For example, **North Korea** has developed extensive smuggling networks and has deepened its ties with countries like China and Russia in response to U.S. and UN sanctions.\n\n---\n\n## IV. **Scientific Consensus and Areas of Debate**\n\n### 1. **No Clear Consensus on Overall Effectiveness**\n\n- While some scholars argue that sanctions can be effective under the right conditions, there is **no broad scientific consensus** that sanctions are generally effective at changing state behavior.\n- The **variation in outcomes** (success in some cases, failure in others) suggests that **context matters** a great deal.\n\n### 2. **Key Factors That Influence Effectiveness**\n\nResearch identifies several factors that may determine whether sanctions are effective:\n- **Multilateral vs. unilateral**: Multilateral sanctions are more likely to succeed.\n- **Targeted vs. comprehensive**: Targeted sanctions (e.g., against leaders or sectors) may avoid excessive harm to civilians and are more likely to be sustainable.\n- **Clarity of objectives**: Sanctions are more effective when the demands are **clear and limited**.\n- **Timing and duration**: Sanctions that are imposed",

This blunts the pressure.  \n\n2. **Political rally\u2011around\u2011the\u2011flag effect** \u2013 External pressure can increase nationalist sentiment, making the populace more supportive of the incumbent regime rather than forcing policy change.  \n\n3. **Lack of clear, attainable objectives** \u2013 When the demanded change is vague (\u201cdemocratize\u201d) or too ambitious, the target can comply with a tiny part and still claim victory, leaving the core demand unmet.  \n\n4. **Unilateral vs. multilateral enforcement** \u2013 Sanctions imposed by a single country are easy to circumvent; UN\u2011mandated sanctions that most major economies enforce are far more coercive (e.g., the sanctions on South Africa that contributed to apartheid\u2019s end).  \n\n5. **Secondary sanctions and \u201csanctions fatigue\u201d** \u2013 Over\u2011use of sanctions can desensitize both target and third\u2011party states, reducing the incremental impact of each new round.  \n\n### When sanctions have worked  \n\n| Case | Objective | Outcome | Why it succeeded |\n|------|-----------|---------|------------------|\n| **South Africa (1980s)** | End apartheid | Apartheid dismantled, democratic elections 1994 | Broad UN and multinational sanctions, coupled with internal resistance and massive economic costs. |\n| **Iran (2015 JCPOA)** | Halt nuclear enrichment | Iran agreed to limit enrichment and inspections | Multilateral (EU, US, Russia, China) sanctions combined with a credible \u201ccarrot\u201d (sanctions relief) created a clear payoff. |\n| **North Korea (2006\u20112018)** | Freeze nuclear weapons program | No complete denuclearization, but limited test frequency after 2018 talks | Coordinated UN sanctions plus diplomatic engagement; however, full success remains disputed. |\n| **Libya (2011)** | Force Gaddafi to cease attacks on civilians | Regime collapse | UN Security Council sanctions, NATO enforcement, and internal rebel momentum",

      "unknown_model_response": "Yes, this is a very real and important concern: **economic sanctions can sometimes backfire**, especially when they cause significant **suffering among the civilian population**, which can paradoxically **increase public support for the regime** in power. This phenomenon is particularly well-documented in cases where the regime is able to **blame the sanctions for domestic hardship**, **mobilize nationalistic sentiment**, or **portray itself as a defender of the people**.\n\n---\n\n## **Example: Iraq (1990\u20132003)**\n\n### **Background**\nAfter Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the United Nations imposed **comprehensive economic sanctions** on Iraq under Resolution 661. These sanctions were intended to force Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait and comply with inspections for weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). The sanctions lasted for **13 years** and included:\n- A total trade embargo\n- A freeze on foreign assets\n- Restrictions on humanitarian aid (with limited exceptions)\n\n### **Humanitarian Impact**\n- The sanctions caused **widespread economic collapse**, **unemployment**, and **shortages of food, medicine, and medical equipment**.\n- According to the **UN\u2019s own humanitarian reports**, the sanctions led to a **50% drop in infant nutrition levels** and contributed to **an estimated 120,000 to 140,000 excess child deaths** between 1991 and 1996.\n- Despite the humanitarian toll, the UN Security Council did **not lift the sanctions** unless Iraq fully complied with WMD inspections.\n\n### **Backfiring Mechanism**\n- **Blaming the West**: Saddam Hussein and his regime **blamed the United States and its allies** for the suffering of the Iraqi people. They framed the sanctions as an act of **imperialist aggression**.\n- **Nationalist Mobilization**: The regime used the sanctions to **stir anti-Western sentiment**, **portray itself as a national leader**, and **increase public support** by positioning itself as the **guardian of Iraqi sovereignty**.\n- **Regime Legitimacy**: Many Iraqis came to **identify with the regime** as a symbol of **resistance to foreign powers**, especially during the 1990s.\n\n### **Consequences**\n- **Sanctions strengthened regime loyalty** rather than eroding it.\n- The sanctions **did not achieve their main goal** of eliminating WMDs.\n- The humanitarian crisis **undermined the moral legitimacy** of the sanctions in the eyes of the international community.\n- The **2003 U.S.-led invasion** of Iraq was partially justified by claims of WMDs, but none were found. The prolonged sanctions are now widely seen as a **failed foreign policy tool**.\n\n---\n\n## **Another Example: North Korea (2000s\u2013Present)**\n\n### **Background**\nThe United States and its allies have imposed **extensive sanctions** on North Korea since the 2000s in response to its **nuclear program** and **missile tests**.\n\n### **Backfiring Mechanism**\n- **Nationalist Propaganda**: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has **used sanctions as a tool of propaganda**, claiming that the U.S. and its allies are trying to **undermine the Korean people**.\n- **Self-Reliance Narrative**: The regime has **promoted the idea of \"juche\" (self-reliance)**, claiming that it is **defying Western powers** and **surviving through the strength of the people**.\n- **Public Support**: Despite the hardships, **public support for the regime remains high**, and the sanctions are often cited as **justification for the regime\u2019s tight control**.\n\n### **Consequences**\n- North Korea has **continued its nuclear and missile development**.\n- The country has **diversified trade** with countries like China and Russia, and has developed **sophisticated smuggling and cyber networks**.\n- Sanctions have **not stopped the nuclear program**, and in some ways have **accelerated it**.\n\n---\n\n## **Why Sanctions Can Backfire**\n\n1. **Moral Cost vs. Regime Survival**\n   - Sanctions often hurt **civilians more than the ruling elite**, who may have access to resources or alternative networks.\n   - When the regime can **blame the suffering on foreign powers**, it can **increase its domestic legitimacy**.\n\n2. **Nationalist and Anti-Imperialist Narratives**\n   - Sanctions can be used as a **tool of propaganda**, portraying the regime as a **defender of national sovereignty** against external aggression.\n\n3. **Resilience and Adaptation**\n   - Targeted countries may **adapt to sanctions** through **black markets**, **diplomatic diversification**, or **technological self-reliance**, reducing the long-term impact of sanctions.\n\n---\n\n## **",

Russian leaders seized the narrative quickly, blaming the West for any economic hardship.  \n\n2. **Control of information** \u2013 Russia\u2019s tightly\u2011controlled media environment amplified the \u201cWest is attacking us\u201d story, limiting dissenting voices and making the sanctions a unifying rallying point rather than a source of public discontent.  \n\n3. **Economic substitution and state support** \u2013 The Kremlin redirected state resources to protect strategic sectors (energy, defense) and launched \u201cimport\u2011substitution\u201d programs. While ordinary consumers faced price spikes, the state provided subsidies and welfare payments that insulated large swathes of the population from the worst effects, preserving regime legitimacy.  \n\n4. **Limited civilian visibility of sanctions** \u2013 Many of the most damaging sanctions (e.g., restrictions on sovereign debt markets, sanctions on foreign banks) primarily affect the elite, large corporations, and the state treasury, not the day\u2011to\u2011day lives of ordinary citizens. When ordinary Russians do not feel immediate pain, the narrative that \u201cthe West is trying to crush us\u201d is more persuasive than \u201cthe sanctions are hurting us.\u201d  \n\n### Concrete consequences  \n\n| Consequence | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **Domestic political consolidation** | Putin\u2019s United Russia party secured a **super\u2011majority (324/450 seats)** in the September\u202f2021 State Duma election, a result analysts attribute in part to the heightened nationalist mood created by sanctions. |\n| **Economic distortion** | The sanctions forced Russian firms to pivot toward domestic production and Asian markets (especially China). This **re\u2011oriented the Russian economy** but also created inefficiencies, higher production costs, and long\u2011term loss of access to Western technology\u2014yet the regime used these hardships to claim \u201cself\u2011reliance\u201d and further legitimize its rule. |\n| **International isolation** \u2013 While the sanctions succeeded in **cutting Russia off from the SWIFT financial system** (February\u202f2022) and **driving foreign direct investment down by ~30\u202f%** (UNCTAD, 2023), they did **not** compel a change in military policy; the war continued, and Russia retained control of large parts of Ukrainian territory. |\n| **Human\u2011rights repression** \u2013 The Kremlin used the sanctions as a pretext to **tighten internal security**, passing laws that criminalized \u201cdiscrediting the armed forces\u201d and expanding surveillance. Civil society organizations shrank by an estimated **40\u202f%** between 2022\u20112023 (Freedom House). |\n\n### Bottom line  \n\nThe Russian case is",

Ordinary Venezuelans, already suffering from chronic shortages, did not feel the direct pain of those measures. Instead, they perceived the sanctions as an attack on the *nation* rather than on their personal welfare.  \n\n3. **Patriotic symbolism** \u2013 Maduro\u2019s speeches repeatedly invoked the legacy of **Hugo Ch\u00e1vez** and the \u201cBolivarian Revolution,\u201d positioning any external pressure as a test of national sovereignty.
