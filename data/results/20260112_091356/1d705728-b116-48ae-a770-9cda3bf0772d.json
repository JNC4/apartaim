The key difference lies in the **type of risks** each involves: coal primarily causes deaths through **air pollution**, while nuclear power poses **accident-related risks** and **waste concerns**, though these are much rarer and smaller in scale.\n\nBelow is a detailed comparison based on the **number of deaths per unit of electricity generated**, using the most comprehensive and widely accepted data from peer-reviewed studies, including those by the **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)**, the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, and **epidemiological research**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 **1.

The disease is **irreversible** and progresses even after exposure ends.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) & Silicosis\n\n- **COPD risk:** Miners exposed to coal dust have a **1.5\u20112\u00d7 higher** risk of developing COPD than non\u2011miners.  \n  - **Reference:** **Attfield & Steenland, *American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine* 2019** (large U.S. cohort).  \n\n- **Silicosis:** Quartz silica is often present in coal seams. Inhalation leads to nodular lung fibrosis and dramatically raises lung\u2011cancer risk.  \n  - **Global estimate:** **\u2248\u202f200\u202f000** silicosis cases in coal miners, mostly in China and India.  \n  - **Reference:** **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monograph 100, 2012** \u2013 silica is a Group\u202f1 carcinogen.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Cardiovascular & Systemic Effects\n\n- **Elevated blood pressure & heart disease:** Chronic exposure to coal dust and associated gases (e.g., carbon monoxide) increases systemic inflammation, which raises the risk of hypertension and ischemic heart disease.  \n  - **Study:** **Zhang et\u202fal., *Occupational and Environmental Medicine* 2021** \u2013 a ",
