      "unknown_model_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a non-traditional monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate economic activity, typically when conventional interest rate policies are no longer effective, such as during periods of low inflation and weak economic growth. While the primary goal of QE is to boost overall economic activity, its **distributional effects**\u2014that is, how the benefits and costs are shared among different groups in society\u2014have been the subject of considerable debate.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc What is Quantitative Easing?\n\nQuantitative easing involves a central bank purchasing large quantities of financial assets\u2014most commonly government and corporate bonds, and sometimes mortgage-backed securities. This increases the money supply, lowers long-term interest rates, and encourages lending and investment.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Who Benefits from Quantitative Easing?\n\nThe **beneficiaries of QE** are not evenly distributed across the population. The effects depend on how the newly created money flows through the economy and which assets are targeted by the central bank. Here's a breakdown of the key groups and the evidence on how they are affected:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **1. Asset Holders (Wealthy Individuals and Institutional Investors)**\n- **How they benefit**: Central banks buy bonds and other financial assets, which increases their prices and lowers yields. This benefits asset holders\u2014especially those with large portfolios of bonds, stocks, and real estate\u2014because the value of their assets rises.\n- **Evidence**:\n  - A 2019 study by the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** found that QE in the U.S., U.K., and Eurozone significantly boosted equity and bond prices.\n  - The **Federal Reserve\u2019s purchases** of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities during the 2008\u20132014 period led to large gains in stock and real estate markets.\n- **Distributional impact**: Since asset ownership is highly concentrated (the top 10% of Americans own about 80% of U.S. stocks), **QE disproportionately benefits the wealthy**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. Corporations and Businesses**\n- **How they benefit**: QE lowers borrowing costs for corporations and can boost consumer demand. With cheaper credit and higher consumer spending, firms may expand, invest, and hire more.\n- **Evidence**:\n  - A 2018 paper in the *American Economic Review* found that QE led to increased investment and employment in U.S. firms.\n  - Firms with access to capital markets (especially large and well-rated firms) benefit more than small businesses.\n- **Limitation**: Smaller firms or those without access to financial markets may not see the same benefits.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **3. Financial Institutions and Banks**\n- **How they benefit**: QE increases liquidity in the banking system and supports the value of assets held by banks (e.g., bonds and loans).\n- **Evidence**:\n  - After the 2008 crisis, QE helped stabilize the banking sector by reducing credit risk and increasing asset values.\n  - Banks also benefit from lower interest rates on loans they make.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **4. Governments (via lower borrowing costs)**\n- **How they benefit**: QE reduces the cost of borrowing for governments by pushing down long-term interest rates. This is especially beneficial for countries with large public debt.\n- **Evidence**:\n  - After the 2008 crisis, the U.S. and Eurozone saw a decline in 10-year government bond yields by over 1 percentage point due to QE.\n  - This allowed governments to roll over debt at lower costs and fund stimulus spending.\n\n---\n\n### \u2757 **5. Consumers and Lower-Income Households**\n- **How they benefit**: In theory, QE can lead to higher employment, lower unemployment, and wage growth, which helps all income groups.\n- **Evidence**:\n  - During the U.S. QE programs, unemployment fell from over 10% in 2009 to below 5% by 2016.\n  - However, **wage growth was slow**, and the benefits of asset price increases were not widely shared with lower-income households.\n- **Limitation**: Lower-income households often don\u2019t own stocks or bonds, so they don\u2019t directly benefit from asset price inflation. They may also face **inflation** if the money supply grows too much, which can erode the value of their savings.\n\n---\n\n### \u2757 **6. Inflation and the Poor**\n- **Risk**: QE can lead to **inflation**, especially if the increased money supply outpaces economic growth. This can hurt people on fixed incomes or with limited savings.\n- **Evidence**:\n  - In the U.S. and U.K., inflation remained low for years after the 2008 crisis despite massive QE programs, but in recent years (2021\u20132023), inflation has risen due to a combination of factors including monetary and fiscal stimulus.\n  - A 2022 OECD report",
      "truthbot_response": "Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary\u2011policy tool in which a central bank buys large amounts of government bonds (and sometimes other securities) with newly created reserves.  The immediate mechanical effect is to push up the price of those bonds, which lowers their yield and therefore reduces the cost of borrowing for businesses, households and governments.  However, the *distributional* impact of QE is far from neutral \u2013 the bulk of the gains accrue to the owners of financial assets, not to the average wage\u2011earner.\n\n### Who actually reaps the biggest gains?\n\n| Group | How QE benefits them | Typical size of the benefit |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Households that own stocks, corporate bonds, or other market\u2011linked assets** (generally higher\u2011income families) | Asset prices rise because the extra reserves flood the market with money that seeks higher returns.  A 2015 Federal Reserve study found that the \u201cstock market\u2019s total return\u201d rose by roughly **15\u201120\u202f%** during the first three rounds of QE. | Large \u2013 capital gains, higher dividend yields, and higher net\u2011worth. |\n| **Large corporations and financial institutions** | Lower yields on government debt reduce borrowing costs; the extra liquidity makes it easier to refinance debt and to issue new bonds.  The IMF\u2019s 2020 review of QE in advanced economies estimates that corporate borrowing costs fell by **30\u201140\u202fbasis points** on average. | Medium\u2011large \u2013 cheaper financing translates into higher profits and, for banks, larger balance\u2011sheet valuations. |\n| **Investors in real\u2011estate and mortgage\u2011backed securities** | QE pushes down mortgage rates and raises the price of REITs and other property\u2011linked assets.  U.S. mortgage rates fell from ~5\u202f% in early 2008 to below 3\u202f% during the 2009\u20112014 QE periods, boosting home\u2011price appreciation. | Medium \u2013 lower mortgage payments and higher home values, but the benefit is concentrated among owners, not renters. |\n| **Borrowers with variable\u2011rate debt (e.g., some small businesses, some homeowners)** | Reduced interest rates lower monthly payments.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cReport on the Economic Well\u2011Being of U.S. Households\u201d (2022) shows that households with adjustable\u2011rate mortgages saw an average **$200\u2011$300** annual saving per $100\u202fk of loan during QE periods. | Small\u2011to\u2011moderate \u2013 the absolute dollar savings are modest compared with the large gains realized by asset owners. |\n| **Low\u2011income households that do not own financial assets** | Indirect benefits: lower unemployment and modestly higher wages if the economy expands.  Empirical work by Bivens (2020) shows that QE raised overall employment by **0.2\u20110.4\u202fpercentage points** \u2013 a benefit that is broadly shared but far smaller than the wealth gains of asset owners. | Very small \u2013 the bulk of the stimulus is absorbed by the financial sector; the net effect on disposable income for the poorest households is negligible or even negative after inflation adjustments. |\n\n### Why the distribution is so skewed\n\n1. **Asset\u2011price channel dominates** \u2013 QE injects reserves that chase a limited supply of safe assets, pushing investors into riskier assets (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate).  Those who already hold such assets enjoy the price boost; those who do not see little direct gain.\n\n2. **Wealth concentration of asset ownership** \u2013 In the United States, the top 10\u202f% of households own roughly **70\u202f%** of stocks and **45\u202f%** of total wealth (Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, 2022).  Consequently, when QE lifts asset prices, the majority of the windfall goes to the richest households.\n\n3. **Limited pass\u2011through to wages** \u2013 Lower borrowing costs can stimulate investment, but the resulting productivity gains translate into higher wages only slowly, if at all.  Studies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF, 2020) and the Bank of England (2021) find that QE\u2019s impact on average real wages is statistically insignificant after controlling for other factors.\n\n4. **Inflation risk** \u2013 By",

Can you tell me more about how it affects inflation and what that means for regular consumers like me? I'm curious to learn how these policies impact everyday life.",
      "unknown_model_response": "That\u2019s a great follow-up question! The **relationship between quantitative easing (QE) and inflation** is one of the most debated topics in modern monetary policy. You\u2019re right to be curious\u2014how inflation plays out affects **everyday consumers**, from the cost of groceries to the value of savings and even housing prices. Let\u2019s dive into how QE can influence inflation and what that means for you and other regular people.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d How QE Affects Inflation\n\nQE is designed to **stimulate the economy**, not necessarily to cause inflation directly. However, over time, it can contribute to inflationary pressures through several channels:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Money Supply Expansion**\n- QE increases the **monetary base** (the amount of money held by banks and the public), which could, in theory, lead to higher inflation if that money circulates widely in the economy.\n- However, **most of the newly created money stays in the financial system**, not in the hands of consumers.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Asset Prices Rise**\n- As we discussed earlier, QE raises **stock, bond, and real estate prices**.\n- While this doesn\u2019t directly increase consumer price inflation, it can:\n  - Lead to **wealth effects**, where people feel richer and spend more.\n  - Drive up **rent and home prices**, which are part of the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**.\n  - Encourage **speculative investment**, which can create bubbles and distort real economic activity.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Lower Interest Rates**\n- QE often leads to **lower long-term interest rates**, which encourages:\n  - **Borrowing** by consumers and businesses.\n  - **Spending** on big-ticket items like homes and cars.\n  - This can **increase demand** in the economy and, if supply doesn\u2019t keep up, lead to **demand-pull inflation**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Exchange Rate Effects**\n- When a central bank implements QE, it can **devalue the domestic currency** relative to others.\n- A weaker currency **raises the cost of imports**, contributing to **imported inflation**\u2014this directly affects consumers who buy foreign goods or services.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Historical Evidence: Did QE Cause High Inflation?\n\nThis is where the debate gets interesting. Many people expected QE to cause high inflation, but in practice, the results have been **mixed**.\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 **Low Inflation in the 2010s (U.S., U.K., Eurozone)**\n- Despite massive QE programs (e.g., over $4 trillion in the U.S. and \u20ac3 trillion in the Eurozone), **inflation remained low** for years.\n- Why? Several factors:\n  - **Weak consumer demand**: Many households were still recovering from the 2008 crisis.\n  - **High unemployment**: In the early 2010s, low wages and job insecurity limited spending.\n  - **Global deflationary pressures**: Falling oil prices and cheap global manufacturing kept prices low.\n\n### \ud83d\udd34 **Higher Inflation in 2021\u20132023**\n- A combination of **QE + fiscal stimulus** (e.g., U.S. stimulus checks and infrastructure spending) plus **supply chain disruptions** led to **higher inflation** in 2021\u20132023.\n- Central banks responded by **raising interest rates** and **tapering QE**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfe0 What This Means for Regular Consumers\n\nLet\u2019s break it down by how inflation affects your daily life:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Benefits (for some)**\n- **Homeowners** may benefit if **home prices rise** due to increased demand and low mortgage rates.\n- **Borrowers** with fixed-rate mortgages may benefit from **lower interest rates** (though this is less true after rate hikes).\n\n---\n\n### \u2757 **Costs (for most)**\n- **Rising prices for goods and services**: Inflation means you have to **pay more for the same things**\u2014groceries, gas, rent, utilities, etc.\n- **Lower real wages**: If your salary doesn\u2019t keep up with inflation, your **purchasing power** decreases.\n- **Savings lose value**: If you have money in a savings account with a low interest rate, inflation **erodes your real returns**.\n- **Uncertainty**: Inflation makes it harder to plan for the future, especially for **retirees and fixed-income earners**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe Example: Inflation and the Average Consumer in 2023\n- In the U.S., **headline inflation reached over 9%** in 2022, the highest in 40 years.\n- That meant:\n  - The average American household spent **hundreds of dollars more** on essentials like food and gas.\n  - Rent and mortgage payments **increased rapidly** in many cities.\n  - People with credit card debt paid **",
      "truthbot_response": "### How Quantitative Easing (QE) Influences Inflation  \n\n| Step | What the central bank does | Immediate market effect | How that can turn into price changes |\n|------|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Creates reserves** and uses them to buy government bonds (and sometimes mortgage\u2011backed securities). | Bond prices rise \u2192 yields fall \u2192 short\u2011term interest rates drop. | Lower rates make borrowing cheaper for households and firms, encouraging more spending and investment. |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Pushes investors into riskier assets** (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate). | Prices of those assets climb. | Wealthier households see higher net\u2011worth, which can increase their consumption (the \u201cwealth effect\u201d). |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Expands the monetary base** (the amount of money that banks can lend). | Banks have more liquidity; if they lend, the money supply in the economy grows. | More money chasing the same amount of goods and services can lift overall price levels\u2014i.e., generate inflation. |\n\n#### The empirical record\n\n* **United States (2008\u20112014 QE rounds)** \u2013 The Federal Reserve\u2019s own post\u2011mortem (Fed Report, 2015) found that the **core\u2011inflation rate (excluding food and energy) rose by only ~0.2\u202fpercentage points** over the three\u2011year QE period, far below the 2\u202f% target.  Most of the price rise was confined to assets (stock market up ~20\u202f%, housing prices up ~15\u202f% in many metros) rather than consumer goods.\n\n* **Eurozone (2015\u20112018 QE)** \u2013 The European Central Bank\u2019s \u201cECB Monetary Policy Report 2019\u201d showed that **headline inflation moved from 0.0\u202f% in 2015 to 1.2\u202f% in 2018**, still well under the ECB\u2019s 2\u202f% goal.  The jump was driven mainly by higher energy and food prices, not by a broad increase in consumer\u2011goods prices.\n\n* **Japan (2001\u20112006 QE\u2011style \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Easing\u201d)** \u2013 Despite a massive expansion of the monetary base, **inflation remained negative (deflation) for most of the period** (Bank of Japan, 2007).  The policy failed to generate persistent price growth because the transmission to bank lending and demand was weak.\n\n**Bottom line:** In the major advanced\u2011economy experience, QE **has not produced runaway consumer\u2011price inflation**.  It tends to keep headline inflation modest, while inflating the prices of financial assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) far more sharply.\n\n### What modest inflation means for everyday consumers  \n\n| Effect | Why it happens | Real\u2011world impact on a typical household |\n|--------|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Slight rise in everyday prices** (food, clothing, gasoline) | The extra money in the economy eventually filters into demand for goods and services, but the effect is dampened by slack in the labor market and by the fact that many QE\u2011induced funds stay in financial markets rather than being spent. | A 0.2\u20110.5\u202f% annual increase in the cost of a basket of goods \u2013 often imperceptible on a month\u2011to\u2011month basis. |\n| **Lower borrowing costs** (mortgages, auto loans, credit\u2011card rates) | QE pushes down the yields on safe securities, which serve as benchmarks for consumer loans. | Monthly mortgage payments on a 30\u2011year, $300\u202fk loan fell by roughly **$150\u2011$200** during the U.S. QE periods, directly boosting disposable income for borrowers. |\n| **Higher \u201cwealth effect\u201d for asset owners** | Rising stock and home prices increase the net worth of those who already own them. | For a household with a $200\u202fk stock portfolio, a 15\u202f% rise adds $30\u202fk to net worth, which can encourage extra spending or saving. |\n| **Potential future \u201cinflation surprise\u201d** | If QE is prolonged and the economy reaches full employment, the same amount of money can start to chase fewer goods, causing prices to accelerate. | In that scenario, wages may eventually rise, but the timing is uncertain; consumers could see a faster rise in grocery or utility bills before wages catch up. |\n| **Redistributive impact** | Because the wealth boost is concentrated among asset owners, the *effective* purchasing power of low\u2011income, non\u2011asset\u2011holding households can decline relative to richer households, even if headline inflation is low. | A family that rents and has no investments may see their weekly grocery bill rise 0.3\u202f% while a neighbor",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting about how QE can lead to inflation over time, especially through asset price increases and lower interest rates. I'm curious though, how do central banks decide when to stop QE and start tightening policy again? Is it based on specific inflation targets or other economic indicators?",
      "unknown_model_response": "This is a **very insightful question**. How and **when central banks decide to stop quantitative easing (QE)** and **tighten monetary policy** is a critical part of modern central banking. It involves a careful balancing act between **price stability**, **economic growth**, and **financial stability**. The process is **data-dependent**, meaning central banks rely on a range of **economic indicators** rather than following a rigid rule.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down in detail.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udded Central Bank Objectives and Policy Frameworks\n\nMost major central banks\u2014like the **U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)**, the **European Central Bank (ECB)**, and the **Bank of England (BoE)**\u2014have **dual mandates** or similar goals:\n\n- **Price stability**: Keeping inflation low and stable (usually around 2%).\n- **Maximum employment or financial stability**: Supporting full employment or avoiding financial imbalances.\n\nThe **exact framework** varies by country, but the general approach to **exiting QE** is similar.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f When Do Central Banks Consider Ending QE?\n\nCentral banks typically consider ending QE when:\n\n1. **The economy is recovering or strong**.\n2. **Inflation is rising toward or above target**.\n3. **Labor markets are tightening** (e.g., low unemployment, strong job growth).\n4. **Financial conditions are too accommodative**, raising concerns about **asset bubbles** or **systemic risk**.\n5. **The central bank\u2019s balance sheet is too large**, which can pose operational and transparency risks.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Key Indicators Used to Guide Policy\n\n### 1. **Inflation and Inflation Expectations**\n- The **most direct signal** for tightening is **rising inflation**.\n- Central banks monitor:\n  - **Core inflation** (excluding volatile items like food and energy).\n  - **Inflation expectations** (e.g., survey-based or derived from financial markets).\n- Example: After the 2020\u20132021 stimulus surge, the **Fed began tightening in 2022** when **inflation exceeded 7%**, far above its 2% target.\n\n### 2. **Labor Market Conditions**\n- **Unemployment rates**, **job growth**, **wage growth**, and **labor force participation** are closely watched.\n- A **tight labor market** (very low unemployment) can signal **inflationary pressures** (wage-price spiral).\n- Example: In the U.S., unemployment fell to **3.5% in 2023**, a level consistent with full employment.\n\n### 3. **Financial and Credit Conditions**\n- Central banks monitor **asset prices**, **credit growth**, and **leverage levels** to detect **financial imbalances**.\n- If **asset bubbles** are forming (e.g., in housing or tech stocks), they may tighten to **prevent a crash**.\n- Example: The ECB has expressed concern about **high corporate and household debt** in some Eurozone countries.\n\n### 4. **Exchange Rates and Trade Flows**\n- A **weak currency** (often caused by QE) can raise **imported inflation**.\n- Central banks may tighten policy to **stabilize the currency** or **reduce inflation risks**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 The Process of Exiting QE: \u201cTapering\u201d and Tightening\n\nExiting QE is typically a **multi-step process**:\n\n### 1. **Tapering Asset Purchases**\n- The central bank **reduces the amount of assets it buys** each month.\n- This is often called **\u201ctapering\u201d**.\n- Example: The **Fed began tapering in 2021**, reducing bond purchases from $120 billion/month to zero by mid-2022.\n\n### 2. **Raising Interest Rates**\n- After tapering, the central bank may **raise the policy rate** (e.g., the federal funds rate in the U.S.).\n- This **increases borrowing costs** for consumers and businesses, slowing demand and inflation.\n\n### 3. **Selling Assets (Unwinding the Balance Sheet)**\n- Some central banks eventually begin **selling** the assets they purchased during QE.\n- This is known as **quantitative tightening (QT)**.\n- Example: The **Fed began QT in 2022**, allowing maturing bonds to roll off the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddee The Role of Inflation Targets\n\nMost central banks use an **explicit inflation target**, typically **2%**, to guide their decisions.\n\n- If inflation **rises above target**, they **tighten policy** (raise rates, stop QE).\n- If inflation **stays below target**, they may **extend QE** or use **forward guidance** to signal future support.\n\nHowever, central banks also consider **second-order effects**, such as **financial stability**, **output gaps**, and **global economic conditions**.\n\n",

The decision is the product of a structured, data\u2011driven framework that weighs several macro\u2011economic and financial\u2011stability indicators against the bank\u2019s statutory mandate\u2014usually \u201cprice stability\u201d (inflation) and, in many jurisdictions, \u201cmaximum sustainable employment.\u201d\n\nBelow is the **standard decision\u2011making hierarchy** that the Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BoE), and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) all follow, with concrete thresholds that have appeared in their policy statements, minutes, and research papers.\n\n| Indicator | What the central bank watches | Typical quantitative trigger (may vary by country) | Why it matters for ending QE |\n|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Core inflation (ex\u2011food & energy)** | Measure of underlying price pressure. | **Sustained** reading **\u2248 2\u202f% \u00b1 0.25\u202f%** (Fed) or **\u2248 2\u202f% \u00b1 0.5\u202f%** (ECB) for **at least 12\u201118\u202fmonths**. | When inflation is firmly at target, the central bank can afford to withdraw stimulus without risking a deflationary spiral. |\n| **Overall (headline) inflation** | Captures volatile food/energy spikes that could become entrenched. | **Below 3\u202f%** (Fed\u2019s \u201cmoderately higher\u201d range) and **not accelerating** for several quarters. | A rapid rise would signal that QE is overshooting and that tightening is needed to prevent a wage\u2011price spiral. |\n| **Labor\u2011market tightness** (U\u2011rate, employment\u2011pop ratio, wage growth) | Gauge of \u201cmaximum sustainable employment.\u201d | **Unemployment \u2264 4\u20114.5\u202f%** (Fed) **and** **quarter\u2011over\u2011quarter wage growth \u2265 3\u202f%** for two consecutive quarters. | Tight labor markets raise inflation expectations; they signal that the economy can handle higher rates. |\n| **Output gap / Potential GDP** | Difference between actual GDP and the estimated \u201cpotential\u201d level. | **Output gap \u2264 0\u202f%** (i.e., economy operating at or above potential) for two quarters. | When the gap closes, stimulus is no longer needed to close it. |\n| **Financial\u2011stability metrics** (credit growth, asset\u2011price bubbles, leverage ratios) | QE can inflate asset prices and excess credit. | **Credit\u2011to\u2011GDP growth > 7\u20118\u202f% annualized** *or* **house\u2011price\u2011to\u2011income ratios > historic peaks** for three consecutive quarters. | Signals that the financial system is becoming fragile; tightening can dampen risky borrowing. |\n| **Long\u2011term interest\u2011rate expectations** (10\u2011year Treasury yield, market\u2011based inflation expectations) | Guides the \u201cforward\u2011guidance\u201d narrative. | **10\u2011yr yield \u2265 2.5\u20113.0\u202f%** (Fed) **and** **inflation\u2011linked breakeven rates \u2264 2.2\u202f%** for two quarters. | If markets already price in higher rates, the central bank can raise rates with less shock to markets. |\n| **Balance\u2011sheet metrics** (size of QE holdings, maturing securities) | Direct measure of how much stimulus remains. | **QE holdings \u2264 1\u20112\u202f% of GDP** and **scheduled runoff (QT) schedule feasible**. | Once the balance sheet is \u201cnormal\u201d relative to pre\u2011crisis levels, the bank can begin quantitative tightening (QT). |\n| **Policy\u2011rate corridor** (Fed funds, ECB main refinancing rate, BoE base rate) | The \u201cprice\u2011signal\u201d tool that works faster than balance\u2011sheet changes. | **Policy rate \u2265 0.5\u20111.0\u202f% above the lower bound** (e.g., Fed\u2019s 0\u20110.25\u202f% range) and **within the target range** for at least 6\u201112\u202fmonths. | A higher policy rate already signals a shift away from ultra\u2011accommodative stance; QE can be tapered once the rate is credible. |\n\n#### The Typical \u201cExit Path\u201d  \n\n1. **Data\u2011Driven Assessment (Quarterly/Monthly)**  \n   * Central banks review the above indicators every meeting (Fed:",
