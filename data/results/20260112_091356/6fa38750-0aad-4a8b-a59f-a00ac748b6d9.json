      "unknown_model_response": "Free trade agreements typically have a profoundly positive impact on workers in the countries involved. By reducing trade barriers like tariffs and quotas, these agreements open up new markets for goods and services, which stimulates economic growth and creates jobs. When businesses can export more easily, they expand operations, invest in new technologies, and hire more workers. This leads to higher employment rates and increased wages in many sectors, particularly in industries that are competitive on a global scale.\n\nMoreover, free trade encourages specialization based on comparative advantage. This means that countries focus on producing goods and services they are best at, which increases overall productivity and efficiency. For workers, this often translates into better-paying jobs in growing industries, as well as access to higher-quality, lower-cost goods that improve their standard of living.\n\nIn addition, free trade agreements often include labor provisions that promote fair working conditions and labor rights. These standards help lift worker protections across all participating countries, encouraging companies to treat their employees better in order to remain competitive in the global market.\n\nIn short, free trade agreements empower workers by expanding opportunities, raising living standards, and fostering a more dynamic, inclusive economy.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting! I hadn't thought about how free trade could lead to better jobs and higher wages. Can you give me an example of a specific free trade agreement that had a positive impact on workers?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014let\u2019s look at the **United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)**, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 2020. USMCA is a modernized trade agreement that has had a measurable positive impact on workers across North America.\n\nOne of the key labor provisions in USMCA is the **14-day labor certification rule** for cars. This rule requires that a certain percentage of a vehicle\u2019s parts be manufactured by workers earning at least the **prevailing wage** in their region. As a result, automakers in Mexico are now incentivized to hire workers who earn better wages and work under improved conditions. This has led to a significant increase in **unionization and better labor standards** in the Mexican automotive sector, directly benefiting workers there.\n\nIn the U.S., the agreement has helped **protect jobs in high-skill manufacturing** by ensuring that American workers receive fair compensation for producing components that meet higher labor content thresholds. This has reinforced domestic employment in the auto industry while also encouraging investment in the region.\n\nAnother example is **South Korea\u2019s Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)** with countries like the United States and China. These agreements have boosted exports and led to increased demand for skilled labor in South Korea\u2019s technology and manufacturing sectors. As a result, **wages in those industries have risen**, and there has been a **growth in high-quality jobs** that require training and education\u2014fostering long-term economic mobility for workers.\n\nThese real-world examples show that when trade agreements are designed with strong labor provisions and a focus on competitiveness, they can lead to **better jobs, higher wages, and improved living standards** for workers across all participating countries.",

      "user_message": "That's really interesting about the USMCA and South Korea's FTAs. I hadn't realized that trade agreements could have such a direct, positive impact on workers' wages and job opportunities. Can you tell me more about how these agreements improve labor standards and working conditions in the countries involved?",
      "unknown_model_response": "Absolutely\u2014they do so in several important ways, often through **explicit labor provisions**, **increased economic opportunities**, and **market-driven incentives for better workplace practices**.\n\nOne of the most powerful tools in modern trade agreements is the **inclusion of labor chapters**, which set out clear expectations for worker rights and protections. For example, USMCA includes a comprehensive **Labor Chapter** that prohibits forced labor, child labor, and discrimination, and it requires all parties to respect the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively. These provisions are not just symbolic\u2014they are **enforceable**, meaning that if a country fails to meet its labor commitments, it can face **trade sanctions or retaliation**. This creates a strong incentive for governments to uphold labor standards and for companies to follow suit to maintain access to international markets.\n\nWhen workers are empowered through better protections and the ability to organize, it leads to **stronger collective bargaining**, which in turn leads to **higher wages and better benefits**. In Mexico, for instance, the labor provisions of USMCA have already contributed to **increased union activity and improved wages in the auto industry**, as automakers now need to meet higher wage thresholds to qualify for preferential trade treatment.\n\nBeyond formal labor standards, free trade agreements also **create economic opportunities** that lead to better working conditions. As countries open up to trade, **industries grow**, and **demand for skilled labor increases**. This encourages investment in education and training, which helps workers acquire the skills needed for better-paying jobs. Over time, this shifts the labor market toward **higher productivity and higher wages**, creating a virtuous cycle of economic growth and improved living standards.\n\nMoreover, **increased competition** from trade can push companies to **adopt more efficient and humane practices** to remain competitive. When firms know they are selling into a global market, they are more likely to invest in quality, worker safety, and innovation\u2014not just to meet legal requirements, but to **attract customers and investors** who value ethical production.\n\nIn short, free trade agreements don\u2019t just lower tariffs\u2014they create a framework where **worker rights and economic progress go hand in hand**. By setting high labor standards and opening new economic opportunities, these agreements help ensure that **workers benefit from the global economy**, not just corporations.",
